My Theory on why Lyft no longer has primetime or surge when Uber is showing surge all day long.,6,0.07924643678245721,Lyft,"I believe the Lyft company will be aquired soon.  Many evidence has been pointing to this including something inside Uber.com itself that is pointing to this on 2 separate pages.  I believe Lyft is purposely not making drivers happy so they can start switching to Uber frequently.  When Lyft has nothing but back to back non-stop pings from all over the cities, Uber won't bombard drivers with pings because they have enough drivers all over the place that are accepting those other pings.  

1.  Lyft has hired an investment bank best known for helping tech companies get acquired.  https://qz.com/718339/lyft-has-hired-an-investment-bank-best-known-for-helping-tech-companies-get-acquired/

2. In one of the Uber.com pages, it shows Lyft being first mentioned in the order for directions for passengers.  This is exactly what it said ""Follow signs for “BUSES / LYFT/ UBER” toward the center island""  

3.  Lyft has hired a previous Uber Executive to take role as one of the heads in Lyft earlier this year 2019.

So what I believe is happening is that Uber and Lyft are in secrets talks for Uber to aquire Lyft and become a giant so big that it may become bigger news than Sprint and T-Mobile merger news.","Just imagine how the world of rideshare would shake if this is true, if Uber aquired Lyft then would Uber be free to make the changes it needs to become profitable? Conspiracy theory. You are more valuable if drivers are happy and you have more trips on paper."
What the heck is a Lyft party bus? That's what he called it.,5,0.44731356642312475,Lyft,"Is this even a thing? I don't understand why or how this guy thought it was appropriate for the the situation. Since it seems most people here are drivers maybe someone can explain?

Last week I had an awkward ride at about 5 in the morning. I just wanted a quick quiet ride to the gym but this guy pulls up blarring techno music so loud it's vibrating the street.

He then proceeds to push karaoke and trying to amp up a party at 5 in the morning. I was in the ride with my husband and we tried everything to make it stop but he just went on about he's the best party bus and it was his original idea and to beware copycats.

I don't ever want to be socially held hostage like this ever again at 5 in the morning.

It was supposed to be a normal ride not whatever drunk people enjoy. It wasn't even the weekend. 

If anything I guess it's a funny story.","Enough 1-stars and he will get the memo. Yeah 1 star if you don't like it, it's not against the TOS though.  Drunks at 2 or 3 AM probably get a kick out of it Socially held hostage? Cancel the ride and order another Uber. 1 star the guy so you don't get him as a driver again.  That must have been super annoying.  Sorry about that"

Was $ per mile changed?,6,0.61356356644796,Lyft,"I'm still newer-ish. I've done about 100+ rides in my area. Always has been about 1.33 per mile. So today I get a long trip to NYC and think YEA BANK! After all is said and done I made shit. I got .735 per mile, and counting the gas and the tolls home I literally made no money. I've never had a different dollar per mile... what gives.","I've had long trips on Uber so it's not being used to small trips. I double checked every of my last 100 rides and the $per mile is nearly cut in half. You are used to making the shore rate in NJ.  Anything to the left of the parkway is regular jersey rates.  .73 per mile.  They paid your mileage properly You’re awful at math. Should have paid attention in high school instead of acting like an titled meathead saying “we’ll never use this in real life.” What city? If they changed your rate card they'd e-mail you.

You don't know what your rate card is. In the driver app select your profile, go to dashboard. On the dashboard website select the menu in the upper left, select Rate Card. Those are your rates.

You're probably used to having more time to mile ratio than a long highway trip."

LYFT = HORRIBLE COMPANY,10,0.8089686590515905,Lyft,"Let me first start by saying this is my 1st reddit post, I also rarely if ever do things like Yelp reviews or go out of my way to complain about services, companies, etc, but my recent Lyft ride from hell gave me inspiration to be a redditor.  It was a normal Friday at work, I wanted to buy a new DJ controller & trade in my old one to a local DJ shop in San Francisco.  I requested a Lyft & 5 minutes later Rosaldo showed up in his white Prius to pick me up along with my DJ controller in a case.  I loaded the case in his trunk & we were off on a 10 minute trip to Market street.  As soon as I got in Rosaldo inquired about the destination, thinking it used to be a music venue, I told him I wasn't sure since I'm relatively new to the City which later lead to me telling him where I'm from along with where I currently live.  Shortly after I asked the same questions, he said he was from Brazil & has been in the City for 5 years, I then asked what area he lives in which lead to Rosaldo saying: ""I don't have to tell you where I live, why the fuck are you asking.""  In that instance I was in shock thinking he was joking but the stare down immediately after made me aware he was not joking whatsoever.  I was dropped off about a minute later & as I was getting out I made the comment: ""You know you're kind of an asshole for driving people around for a living, but it was a pleasure, hope you have a better day.""  I was in the process of unloading my case from the trunk when Rosaldo floored the gas pedal which lead to me falling forward in the street.  As soon as I got up I realized what he was doing so I chased after him down a side street to try & get my equipment out of his car.  I got close but he drove into on coming traffic to flee the scene.  I called the police to explain the situation which later lead to a police report saying that Rosaldo cause me to fall in the street & stole my equipment.  I contacted Lyft support via the app explaining the situation in detail which later lead to a barrage of BS emails from Lyft support.  About 3 hours later I received a text from Kira at the Lyft hub as well as an automated text from a (855) 529-5676 number telling me that good news, Rosaldo was kind enough to return my lost item & for the drivers inconvenience I will be charged a $15 fee.  I was livid at that point & replied to the various emails from support letting them know how upset I was & at the very least I wanted the $15 refunded along with a ride credit.  This whole situation lasted almost 2 weeks before I finally got a resolution.  I eventually drove to the hub where I picked up my gear, while I was there I wanted to talk to a supervisor, someone face to face to have this whole thing resolved.  All I got was that I needed to contact the lost & found department via text or email to dispute the charges.  After numerous texts & emails I finally got a lengthy text telling me that safety is one of Lyft's main concerns but they cannot refund me the money or offer any kind of credit.

Your driver sounds like a nutter, but next time remember to remove all personal belongings before sounding off. Or better yet, say nothing and just down star in case you're dealing with someone more ""off"" than you know. This is proof that when two assholes collide shit happens. Seriously if you think I have the time or energy to go over your post for the next 5 days you are wrong. Sounds like you’re just as much an asshole as he is. If you had kept your fat fucking mouth shut when you left the vehicle none of this would have happened. Lyft isn't responsible for the items you bring into the car. The $15 charge was because the driver drove back to the Lyft hub and dropped off your stuff. Go to the hub, pick up your stuff, and move on. There's probably nothing that the police could do anyways. You got your items back and according to your story the driver never assaulted you. If him driving away from you caused you to fall that's probably a civil matter and you never mentioned that you were harmed and incurred expenses related to it. Sounds to me like the driver was plotting to drive off with the item the whole time to collect a $15 fee. He's obviously hurting for money and very emotionally detached. This is the future of our society as people's freedom, values and rights are continually raped from them."
Hour Wages,8,0.8674177331367025,Lyft,"So i keep hearing shit about ""30 an hour"" this and that but then it ends with ""in California"" like wtf... I get the bill is passed there but when the hell is the rest of the USA gonna get an Hour Wage? Because if California is making $30 an hour while I'm making jack shit I might as well just quit

Whoever's telling you that is lying. In California it's pretty much just Los Angeles and San Francisco. Also it's not an hourly wage but you pretty much get back to back ride request in these two cities, were you end up averaging 25-30 bucks an hour.

Lyft is lovely for the flexibility but one shouldn't expect Lyft to makes ends meet or to support a family. 30 an hr minus expenses minus cost of living in California isn't jack shit.  


1. Get a real job.
2. Drive for lyft part time Some people logon at weekend night bar close, knockout steady rides, get some bonuses, logout. Look at their earnings and sure it looks great hourly. I'm sitting here at 3pm trolling the internet procrastinating getting fuel and food before I go online. Believe me we don’t make 30 an hour. The only time I make 30 an hour is during my streak bonus. 25 dollar bonus every 5 rides between 6:30-7:30 am. If I start at 6:30 by 9am I’ll have 90-100 bucks but that’s ONLY during a streak!"
Driver needing me to give them directions,6,0.8881931960996654,Lyft,"I use Lyft often and most of the rides are fairly pleasant. Sometimes a driver will ask me where we're going and I don't mind telling because the gps system doesn't show the business name [they should really change this]

Anyways yesterday I got a driver (older woman, late 60s maybe). The first thing she says as I get buckled is how to get out of the parking lot. We were at a Walmart so I told her the best way to exit. Then she asks which turn to make once we get onto the road. And then some. She seemed kind of irritated for some reason too.

I was a bit taken aback because I thought Lyft equips drivers with a GPS system so asking passengers for directions is not needed. 

I 5 stared because she already had 5.0 rating so I didn't want to ruin it. But it made me wonder if anyone else has drivers like this.","I've had a couple times where after I tap pick up  passenger, the app has frozen for a minute or two and will not load the navigation because of the cell signal.  In this case I have had to ask which direction to get started going so the app will unfreeze. I second what previous people said, sometimes the app freezes, but I do let the passenger know and to kindly tell where we are going until the app kicks back in. Like /u/burressndb said, it's possible her GPS wasn't working cause of cell signal.  That would also explain her irritated demeanor.  But I've had that happen to me more than once, and I just let the pax (you) know what's going on and that I need some help until I get back the cell signal.  The last time this happened to me, the guy was cool about it and I only needed like 2 turns worth of help until I was able to get going and then cell data came back eventually.  Even got a tip from the guy and a compliment that I handed the situation well for what was going on.  

With how low rates are these days, I'm not exactly surprised you got a driver like that, as many very desperate drivers are mostly the ones driving these days.  But some customer service skills could do her some good. To be honest , When you are coming out of a parking long lot and the map tells you to turn. Its hard to figure out which way to go unless you know the area. Let me guess....this is why you left no tip? I can surely tell you that you don't know shit. Did you ever use a GPS? If you never try using Google Maps for directions, why you want to criticize others base on your uninformed opinion?

Most of the time, GPS navigation is a one-dimension problem. Given that the car is moving on the road, the GPS accuracy can be say 100 ft. You know you are not 100 ft off the road. And 100 ft ahead or behind doesn't matter when you are driving.

A parking lot is a rectangular or a polygon. That's two-dimensional. It's not just a problem of driving ahead or turn back. You can go on all 4 directions, actually 360 if no parked cars are blocking you. Have you done any paper map reading? Now you have to do it on a tiny 4x6 paper while driving. Basically GPS just tell you approximately where you are.

Do you know that compass don't work inside cars? Because there are too many powerful electromatic fields. You have to calibrate the compass. But that useless if the compass is not fixed to the car. So you may have OEM digital compass in the car that are calibrated in the factory. But still, the direction is coarse, like NW vs N.

Now even if the smartphone has a ""compass"", navigation systems like Google map wouldn't trust it. It uses calculus to determine the speed and direction of the car. It only works if the car moves enough so the satellites get reliable readings. The problem is relatively easy for a 1-dimensional road. You are heading one way or the other.

Now in a 2-D parking lot, the car can move in any directions and the GPS have to be exact or it will be useless. GPS is never exact and did they ever tell you their accuracy? 10ft? 100ft? Even if the position can be 10 ft off, to determine the direction of the car with a few readings is very unreliable. And the satellites are some 10,000 miles from the car. If the car slows to a stop or zig-zag, the direction information will be lost.

Once the driver stops to pick you up in a large parking lot, the directional information will be lost. When she starts the trip, the navigation will tell her to head to, say, NW, or to head to Main street.  This is the time that the GPS is pretty useless.

There are a few ways to get out of this and none is what you are thinking. Patiently do map reading on a 4x6 map. Remember where you come from the main road and return back there. Randomly pick a route and start driving. The GPS system will catch up and then start giving good directions once it knows where the car is and where it's heading."
Over 16k rides until I was held at gunpoint and then deactivated due to my “background check” Ex Law Enforcement and CRYSTAL clear background check on a federal level.,64,0.9143737516690184,Lyft,Image,"Hello, my name is Sean Carrey. I was a Lyft driver for over 5 years until I was deactivated. Over 16,000 rides and never under a 4.95. 

*THIS IS MY ONLY SOCIAL MEDIA*

I REPORTED to LYFT and the police that I was held at gunpoint for my wallet and my cell phone. It was all recorded on dash cam and cannot share footage until I get the play from local level law enforcement. 

The following day I was issued a notification from Checkr about Lyft requesting a background check. 

Lyft immediately deactivated me and said there was an issue with my background. 

Approximately 4 days later. 

They came back to me saying I would not be eligible to continue driving. See screenshot 1. 

I challenged checkrs ruling but they refused to re run my background check. 

Mind you I’m a ex law enforcement officer with a crystal clear background at a federal level. 

Too verify that I’m a driver and I was deactivated see screenshots 2&3

I will NOT disclose my location or any further information to anyone except my legal counsel Something isn’t making sense here. I would keep pushing up further and further.  Maybe tweet the CEO.  I don’t see any logical reasons why the robbery would have anything to do with the deactivation. Probably a coincidence. Strange not to hear of an armed robbery of rideshare driver in the news either as thats a hot topic lately. Best of luck. I’d be frustrated to say the least. Lift is BOT run company. They cannot abandon this business plan because it would mean bankruptcy. Ur best option is to challenge lift in an environment they cannot BOT their way through. Basically small claims court for loss of wages. if Lyft doesnt want you, document this on every social media level, even the local news media once cleared and get your story out there. Have you tried getting a copy of your background check?  Go to [applicant.checkr.com](https://applicant.checkr.com). I appreciated this post OP. As an avid user of rideshare I like to know what's up and make my choices accordingly. Fuck lyft. They are carrying their victory of hitting the bottom faster than Uber. I hope you can make up the money with Uber or find something else that works better for you. u/Lyft fucking Lyft piece of shit company, such a fucking dumpster fire wow You could probably make way more as private security at events than carting paxholes around, no? Well, in my market this would be a pay raise. Regardless of the reason, my 4 year experience with lyft has been a snowball rolling down a mountain bringing an avalanche with it. This company is either headed for bankrupcty or merging with Uber anyways. 
Drive a bus, drive for Uber, or whatever else you can find. My grandpa use to be a little league umpire and wouldn't even take the pay he just wanted to be out there. This is a feature, not a bug. Thank you for your service Find out where your nearest “Lyft hub is” and explain it ... this is also perfect to take to your local news station. You want to make this a PR nightmare for u/Lyft as what probably happened was “major police report found!” And some bot that from Lyft has a connection to Checker and it automatically deactivated you. Where are screenshots 2 & 3? I'm pretty sure someone who was indicted with was crimes was allowed to drive with Uber at one point m they really don't care. Crime doesn't pay. Passenger said it was your fault. Lol now you black lol [deleted]"
Thoughts on this article — Cross Post from r/personal finance,0,1.4026723627801294,Lyft,"I happened upon this article about a driver talking about how much he makes driving for Uber and Lyft: https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-lyft-driver-how-much-money-2019-10#when-it-was-all-said-and-done-i-ended-the-week-making-25734-in-a-little-less-than-14-hours-on-the-job-8

In short, he says he made $257 over 13.75 hours of work, for almost $19 an hour. He later mentions expenses (like gas) but as an afterthought, not including it in the hourly wage.

The federal mileage rate is $0.58 per mile. This represents the actual cost to you and your car per mile driven. The driver drove 291 miles for the work he mentioned, which translates into expenses of $169. 

This means his profit is only $88, for an hourly rate of $6.40. Yet reading the article, it all sounds super positive and awesome and gives the impression that it's a great side-gig. No, all you're doing is turning vehicle depreciation into cash.","I rode with an Older gentlemen about a year ago in a Lyft. He said he is retired and lives with one of his kids and watches his Grandson all week. He said he drove for Lyft just to get out of the house, interact with some other adults and make a little extra but he was comfortably retired. He told me confidently he nets about $6 USD an hour after all factors considered which seemed pretty spot on. I have asked a lot of drivers if they make good money and most seem to think they do or they are just too embarrassed to admit they don't As a former pizza boy, I told all new drivers that the shittier their car was the more money they’d make.  

I made as much as my average car was worth in about 30 hours work, and went through 8 of them in 4 years. I had a buddy who drove for Uber on his commute to work. He'd be ready to leave at least 2 hours early (we worked a noon-9pm shift, make 1-2 rides on the general direction of work from his place, and then try and pick up 1-2 on his way home. Some days he had no rides, but some days he was able to essentially get paid to drive to work, and deduct for it to boot.

I think he stopped when his car got totaled; I don't believe he had gap insurance. It was a good gig while it lasted tho. True, to a point, because the $0.58/mi reflects expenses, but there's a lot that goes into it ([this is a neat article](https://blog.abacus.com/3-surprising-factors-that-determine-the-irs-mileage-rate/)). And some costs are not tied to how much you drive, or loosely so (titling fees, registration, insurance, and depreciation due to time).

And it does assume typical business use, which is usually newer cars, so more depreciation. The guy in the article has a Prius model that I think was introduced in 2010, so depreciation isn't very high. But I agree it's something most people don't consider.

>He later mentions expenses (like gas) but as an afterthought

He's spending less than $0.05/mi ($13.22/291 miles) and less than $1.00/hr ($13.22/13.75 hrs) on gas. So yeah, it's a cost, but he's being smart about his vehicle. My personal theory is that the way Uber functions today is not the way it was intended.  I think Uber or the theory of ride sharing to be more precise was based on the idea that someone is already driving from point a to point b and their car is empty.  So lets utilize that empty space and have them pick someone up on their way.  This model makes sense because the person driving already has a sunken cost, it does not cost them anything more to pick up a passenger and drop them off along the way they were already going.  This would allow Uber rides to be super cheap.  

And for the person driving to make 100% profit. Federal mileage rate does not represent actual cost, it represents the federal tax deduction, which reduces your taxable income. 

Actual expenses will be highly variable based on make, model, condition of the vehicle and driving habits. >No, all you're doing is turning vehicle depreciation into cash.

As someone with a car that has 300k miles, sign me up I feel so bad for drivers in brand new cars or luxury cars who are driving. They just have no idea... 291 miles more than likely did not cost $169. When taking my own car and costs into consideration over the 150,000 miles I've driven it so far, I worked my own average expense to be about 80% of that. Oh, wait. That still kinda sucks.

Edit: also probably worth noting that I drive a Toyota. I haven't even had any repairs yet. I'm an Uber driver. I am part of a community of Uber/Lyft drivers that you can find over at UberPeople.net. Yes you are correct, there are many drivers who do NOT understand the true cost of driving for these companies.

Uber and Lyft have been advertising that drivers can make $30 or something per hour with them. That's bullshit. First of all, you can never guarantee that amount because earning money here relies on having passengers. You don't get paid by the hour. You get paid PER MILE and a little per minute. For example, here in LA/OC California, the rates in majority of the places are 60 CENTS PER MILE, 20 CENTS PER MINUTE for Uber (and it keeps getting lower each year). Lyft, from what I've heard from Lyft drivers, is just 30 CENTS PER MILE. Second, serious drivers have to take into consideration the cost of GAS. Here, it's over $4/gallon now!!! Let's say you need to put gas in your car every day and get it to full tank. You're gonna spend $30 to $40 a day at the current prices. Now let's say you start driving passengers around and for that day you made $100. Well guess what, you have to deduct $30 or $40 from that to see how much you probably really made (taxes, depreciation, and other costs not yet included!). So suddenly, you'll see you actually just made only around $60! If you drive Uber full time, you're pretty much guaranteed to have to go to the maintenance shop monthly at around $100 to $120 per visit, not counting the extra costs of whatever they find that you'll need to have fixed!

Tips, those are things you shouldn't be counting on as a driver because there is no guarantee you'll receive any. Besides, depending on your market, majority of your passengers might not tip no matter how great your service is or how clean and awesome your car is. 

Another thing that makes it hard to make money with Uber is the lack of information you receive as a driver, regarding the ride request you're receiving. All you really get is the location of where you're supposed to pick up your passenger and their name (whatever name they made up, it can be as ridiculous as Mickey Mouse). The destination will be revealed once you actually have the passenger in the car and you start the trip. Now most recently, Uber started giving us drivers ""ranks"". There are ""Pro"" drivers, ""Gold"" drivers, and ""Diamond"" drivers. Pro drivers are your standard drivers who have medium to low Acceptance Ratings (as in they don't accept all ride requests given to them) and moderate to huge Cancellation Ratings (as in they cancel ride requests for varying reasons). These are your ""smart"" Uber drivers (and I'll explain in a bit why). ""Gold"" drivers are the ones with high Acceptance Ratings and low Cancellation Ratings. These drivers basically accept almost all rides and rarely cancel requests. ""Diamond"" drivers pretty much are near perfect when it comes to having extremely high Acceptance Ratings and almost non-existent cancellation ratings. The higher your rank, the more ""perks"" you get from your Uber Debit Card like 5% gas discounts and the like (which might turn into a credit card later). For Gold and Diamond drivers, they also get information on the general direction of where a ride request is going before they accept the ride, information that is not given to normal Pro drivers. So if that's the case, then why did I say the ""Pro"" drivers are the smart ones?

In order to make money with Uber, you have to be very picky about which ride requests you take. For example, if you are a Pro driver, you don't get information on the general direction a ride request is going when it pops up on your phone. What you see is where the request is coming from, how many miles it is away from you. For me personally (as well as other drivers), we accept ride requests that are just 3 miles away or less. Why? For each ride, you have a Minimum Fare (it's around $2.40). At 60 cents per mile and 20 cents per minute, you can earn $2.40 after around 3 or 4 miles of driving. If your ride request comes from 3 miles or 4 miles away, you pick up your passenger, and you find out that they're just traveling less than a mile away (or worse, just block away to the nearest liquor store), then you just wasted your gas, time, and money. You are NOT PAID while you're on your way to the passenger, so the 3 or 4 miles you drove to get to them doesn't count! In short, you drove 3 or 4 miles for this person, picked them up, and then dropped them off just a block away, and you only earned the minimum fare of $2.40 due to how short the trip was. Now let's see an alternate scenario. Let's say you received a ride request and it's just less than a mile away from you. Even if it's just a trip to the next block, you'll get the $2.40 minimum fare. So if we compare it, first trip example took a total of 3 or 4 miles plus an extra block to earn $2.40. In the second example, you only drove a total of less than 1 mile plus a block to earn $2.40. Second trip wins because you wasted less time, less gas.

Another way of making money as an Uber driver now is simply cancelling on passengers who don't show up on time in order to receive a Cancellation Fee ($3.75). Let's say you arrive at the spot on the gps that is where you're supposed to pick up your passenger. A timer shows up, usually 6 minutes in total, that you have to wait for the passenger. If they don't show up in that time, then you have the option of simply cancelling the ride to collect the Cancellation Fee. Drivers are not required to keep waiting on passengers who still haven't shown up after the time limit expires. Drivers who do that are just too kindhearted. If you notice nowadays, especially here in California, there are a lot more cancelled rides unlike before. Reason for this is that drivers have realized that there's no incentive for waiting on passengers beyond the time limit. Let me share my own personal experience. One time I was waiting on a passenger. The time limit already expired. Still, I thought I'd give the passenger an extra 5 minutes. Still no passenger, I even texted and called but there was no reply. Finally the passenger showed up. Guess how short the ride was? Just to two blocks down the road! I only earned $2.75 to $3.00 from that, most of the money came from the waiting time fee, which is just around 12 cents a minute.  Had I cancelled right after the time limit expired, then I would've had gotten MORE money, $3.75. 

There are a lot of other strategies on how to make money with Uber, most of them are dependent on your specific market. Different territory, different pay rates per mile/time, different features you can use, different population. 

Anyway go on UberPeople.net if you want to learn more about the problems of rideshare drivers. Don't be surprised if you find that majority of drivers hate Uber. I definitely don't have any loyalty to that company and the moment I have the opportunity to switch to another job, I'd abandon it faster than a warp speeding Enterprise.

Oh yeah, according to Uber, [""drivers aren't essential""](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/uber-drivers-ab5-tony-west-ride-share-business-california/), I think this will make people more understanding as to why Uber drivers feel the way they do towards the company. Nobody's pointing out that the author also incurred a $430 expense to fix their car. So in this week they lost a huge amount of money, not even counting gas cost or maintenance cost. That article is called Content Marketing. They are ads that look like journalism articles but the objective is to sell you something. In this instance they are probably trying to get people to sign up as drivers. Driving for Uber is basically a reverse mortgage on your vehicle equity + labor Driving for Uber or Lyft is the definition of a dead end job.  Burns time and gets you absolutely nowhere. Yes. Uber's entire business model rests on drivers not taking maintenance and depreciation into account. I thought about doing it as a side-gig, but the increase in insurance to include cover while driving for Uber/Lyft meant I'd have a high monthly minimum to just break even - not ideal for someone looking to do it in their spare time. Makes me wonder how many drivers have the correct insurance. 

Do either company check the insurance coverage of their drivers? when i came across that article I actually thought it was a planted article from Uber.

Homeboy's driving a prius and getting gas for $2.25 / gallon so the fuel expenses are quite cheap. No mention of insurance costs or vehicle depreciation factored in. I don't know if Uber/Lyft insure their drivers by default nowadays.

Nobody's arguing you can't make money driving on Uber. We just want them to know they're not making nearly as much as they think they are. I think that this is very dependent on what your purpose with Uber is. If you’re doing it as a side gig during your free time $6.40 an hour isn’t terrible. Most beer money sites net you a buck or two an hour. 

It’s also highly dependent on your city. I recently moved and know no one in my new city. I drive Uber/Lyft in my free time since I wasn’t doing much else and am usually between $30-$40/hour before expenses. After expenses and taxes I’m usually more about the $20 range. If you can show me a job that I can work whenever I have free time (not on anyone else’s schedule) that I can earn $20/hr after taxes that requires extremely minimal effort then I might switch but for now it’s an easy way to pick up a few hundred bucks a month. That’s why I’m a bicycle courier for Uber eats. No insurance, no gas (besides having a good meal before and some cheap energy bars on me), no worry of parking tickets or expensive car maintenance repairs.  

So for the most part if I make 22$ an hour, that’s my take home.  + my cardio is definitely the best it’s ever been lol Most of the drivers are pretty aware of this.  Spend some time in the Uber subreddit and you can see most of them try to only run during surge pricing or get tons of minimum fares over and over.  I've also met people using it as a way to promote another side gig. The only real benefit to driving for rideshare companies is you get paid instantly.  These companies have 2 types of customers, the riders and the drivers. There’s a lot of missing information here that he is not accounting for, such as being involved in an accident.

Since this was a 1 week experiment, I doubt he would bother informing his insurance company that he is using his vehicle in this manner. More often than not, uber/lyft drivers rarely have the right insurance and that will generally lead them to a difficult claim in the future.

For what I’ve seen so far, using the vehicle for something like this acts more like a loan. Sure you’re getting actual cash, but people will forget about the expenses somewhere else. I travel for work every week and have a pretty regular driver who takes me to the airports every week. I actually met him through Uber but switched to paying directly so he could avoid paying Uber a cut of his fare.

A little while back he told me he stopped driving for Uber entirely because they took advantage of both riders and drivers. I asked him how he meant and he brought up surge pricing. He said nowadays, drivers don't get the difference between normal price and surge price, they get a pitiful ""bonus"" instead while Uber pockets the rest.

Uber's entire justification for charging 2-4x as much for rides used to be that the drivers benefited and would be more likely to be available during peak hours. Now what's the justification? It just screws over riders and drivers alike. I'm going to give the internet my secret to how I use and drive for Uber/Lyft.

I use it on my commute home using destination mode. I don't stay out late, change routes, or chase surges. I just flip on the app and make my way home. Here's how I justify it:

1. I'm already headed in the direction anyway, so my time and mileage is consider sunk cost.
2. The slight detour that I'll usually incur, which would be due to taking an early exit into a housing development that I would have otherwise driven right past is what I'll use to calculate $/hr revenue. On the days I get rides, it's $10-$15 for  every 10 minutes added to my drive home, that equates to an effective $60-$90/hr range. (I'll get to wear/tear, taxes)
3. I only do it on my way home. You never know how much of a detour the ride might take you. I don't have to be ""on-time"" in getting home. It is not worth it to be late to my job so I never do it on my way to work.
4. Most people requesting rides at 5pm rush hour are not the rowdy type pax stories you read about. They're just trying to get home too. I've had zero issues with passengers in the 3 years I've been doing this.
5. Weather and events: The trains are down? A conference in town? Surge rates bring my rate to 2x-3x what I usually make to $120-$180/hr. More than what I make at my desk.
6. This is my second favorite reason: I deduct the miles on my tax return. I like to look around and imagine I'm the only guy sitting in miserable traffic with the commute considered a taxable expense! Given that some days I get no rides, I actually filed a loss on my 2017 and 2018 taxes, further reducing my taxable income. Double win!
7. This is my favorite reason I driver for Uber: I get to chat about finances with strangers. I'm a 9-5 white collar professional pulling in 6 figs. I dress sharp, drive a nice/clean car. Naturally people are curious as to why I drive for uber. I subscribe to FIRE. I spread the word. As you can expect when I talk about this topic, it blows many people's minds. It's a 15-20 minute conversation between 2 strangers so I tell them everything: My story, my track to retire early, and how I'm doing it. This conversation not only helps pass the time, but it inspires many people. This usually turns into receiving a nice tip at the end of the ride. Some even ask if I'm single ;) I have had a few family members and friends work for lyft, uber, uber eats and door dash.  From what they have told me uber eats and door dash are much more tip friendly. People in general are used to tipping when they have food delivered. (pizza, room service etc) 

I've also seen a friend go uber cause he needed $200 to make rent at the end of the week. Reminds me of that ""news video"" where a journalist interviews people about Amazon Flex drivers.  How they make $20 per hour.

What they didn't account for, but was mentioned in the video is how the drivers had to wait in a line, often longer that 30 minutes with their car idling, just to get to the gate.  Only to find out at the gate what area they would get.  If they turned down that area ( which could be 45 minutes or more of a drive from the hub), they would not get any work and would get a write up for wasting Amazon's time.  Three write ups and you can no longer deliver.

The driver they were following had to turn down the job that day (with traffic it was an hour drive to the neighborhood), meaning all that waiting was for nothing.  Then later you find out, that driver went to help another driver for part of the second driver's pay.

This was due to the other driver not being able to finish in time because the expected time to deliver was skewed due to more than one person delivering in the past. Amazon also only counts delivery time, they don't count the time shuttling the packages from the hub to the neighborhood when they create blocks of work.

In the end the original driver spent about 8 hours of time, and I believe only received around $100 before expenses.

Not to mention, these drive as a gig jobs skirt around federal DOT regulations.  Every uber driver I've had was well past the 14 hour daily limit. A lot of the driving that I do for work is tax deductible.  I found that I tended to do much better on how much I got out of that deduction if I was either driving a super shitty car with almost no depreciation or a car with super high milage.  I would assume that the same would be true as a delivery driver for uber eats, doordash, or whatever.  

I got a car that pretty reliably gets \~45 mpg, so I end up spending around 5 cents/mile for actual gas.  The rest goes towards depreciation and whatever else.  At my tax bracket of 22%, the deduction ends up translating to about 12.6 cents/mile, so I get an extra 7 cents/mile or so to cover maintenance and whatever else. Jalopnik had an article about this.

https://jalopnik.com/uber-and-lyft-take-a-lot-more-from-drivers-than-they-sa-1837450373

I wonder if business insider was paid to publish this article. I know a finance/financial guy whose wife passed away. He wanted a second job to keep his mind off of losing his wife. He ran the calculations for numerous cars to determine which one was most financially viable for Uber. He picked a car with the longest warranty with the lowest maintenance requirements. In addition he researched high traffic areas and focused on events with surge pricing.   

He ended up driving for about two years, finding a new person to date and then sold the car...After he sold the car he closed the books on his Uber ""business"". He took in deprecation, maintenance, gas, etc, etc and ended up making $15 or $16 an hour from Uber.  He built a significant list of personal referrals in which he would take previous passengers to concerts and events outside of Uber, however. When you added in the referrals to his Uber hourly wage it was close to $20 an hour after expenses.   

&#x200B;

In my book thats pretty decent for driving a car... Just to add to what is already being discussed, Uber and Lyft are losing money each and every year on their services, meaning not only is this side hustle probably not making you anything but it is likely unsustainable at current prices. 

A good side hustle should both make you income and be sustainable. Otherwise you are better off learning/doing something else with your time. >. No, all you're doing is turning vehicle depreciation into cash.

Actually, maybe that's ok.  I mean, people turn equity in their home into cash.  Obviously, this isn't ok for people who don't actually understand what that really means.  But, once you own the car, it's hard to actually get at the value that it represents.  If your need for cash is short term, this might be a reasonable way to turn that equity into something useful for yourself.

I do not work for any driving service.  I just thought this was an interesting take on it. Its not just uber, if you think about it. If you are working a job that pays 15 dollars per hour, lets say, if you factor in the cost of commute, add the time of commute in the total hours worked as unpaid time, now factor in other costs, like your job might require you to wear a Suit, or good clothes, or only formal clothes. Factor those things in and you will be looking at something close to 6 dollars per hour. I drove around 80,000KM last year (50,000 Miles). According to you the actual cost to me and my car would be $38,500 CAD ($29,000 USD).  I maybe spend $8,000 CAD a year on gas, $700 on Oil Changes, $1000 on Misc items. Please tell me where the other \~$29,000 in expenses I am supposedly accruing are going towards? Lol my entire car only cost $14,000. What a ridiculous argument. This is the standard business model for all so called disruptive industries:

1. Persuade people to work for less than minimum wage
2. Cash in stock options
3. Er..that's it I'd argue that you're just wrong.

The federal mileage rate isn't really intended to represent actual cost.  It's a catch all number for tax deduction purposes.  It factors in more things than just gas or maintenance and a lot of those costs are fixed regardless of how many miles he drives.  It's not like he has to get another drivers license every time he picks up someone.  It also assumes a relatively new car which is important, considering he's driving a 10 year old Prius that is going to depreciate far less.

He's definitely not making $23/hour but he's definitely making money and able to deduct more on his taxes then he's actually spending on his car.  A general rule for all delivery people: Buy an old, cheap car. I don't think you understand what ""federal mile rate is"" > all you're doing is turning vehicle depreciation into cash

That's exactly what you're doing, and why it *was* really geared towards side gig territory instead of what it's become. Got nothing better to do tonight, and want to get some pocket change to drive people around? Cool. As a legit part time job, tough, there are much more lucrative jobs with less headache.

Which, BTW, is an issue with how people use ""side gig"". Side gig would be... undervalued stuff that you do in your spare time. Hocking crocheted stuff on Etsy or driving ride share. If you want real income on a side gig, you want a part time job. An Uber driver explained to me that it is much more cost effective for him to rent his car through Uber rather than use his own car. He said he’d tried explaining this to many other drivers but they don’t understand or don’t listen. I talked to an Uber driver who perfectly understood that he was working to convert depreciation of his car into cash. 

But it's better than letting that potential sit there. The other advantage is that you are ""cashing out"" in partial amounts. If you sell the whole car, you don't have a car anymore. I just want to point this out: 100,000 miles assuming 0.58/mile is $58,000. Most cars won’t have many issues leading up to 100k miles if you do some regular recommended maintenance.  

OP mentions gas separately FYI. Gas is included in that federal mileage rate.  In any event that $0.58/mile is pretty high.  Actual profits are likely quite a bit more than implied in the article.

I don’t particularly like the ride share model (for drivers - awesome for passengers), but drivers really should understand what they are getting into before they decide to turn their personal vehicle into a taxi cab. Late to the party, but I want to add something. Just because the government lets you deduct .58cent per mile it doesnt mean your cost is .58 cent per mile. That number is supposed to include the vehicle cost, regular maintenance (oil, tires, ...), and operating costs (insurance and fuel, AFAIK).

Today the rates are shit, but there was a time (2016ish) where one could (without much effort) take in $2k per week in some markets. At that rate it took 6 weeks to pay for a car, insurance, and gas for the whole year. At the end of the year you could deduct all the mileage (30 to 50k) or so using the mileage deduction, + a few other thousand in food/phone/car wash and so but the real cost tends to be half of that (even if you consider the whole cost of the car).

I stopped driving a while ago but im still in a FB group for drivers and current rates are so low that most would be better off working at a minimum wage job (assuming they could put in the same hours). It takes ~70 hours for them to get $1700 or so. I imagine that at least $100 goes to gas. Minimum wage in SF is $15. With 30 hours of overtime they could get ~1275 after 70 hours. Yeah. We need to get back to the purity of the cab companies who never took advantage of anyone and certainly didn’t place six figure barriers to entry in front of their hapless employees. On the bright side pizza drivers about get a whole new stock of throwaway vehicles. One thing from your analysis to think about is that this guy drives a Prius.  He spent under $15 in gas for the entire week of driving.  That compared to your average car is quite low. [Loooooong thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/aw7y5q/i_delivered_for_uber_eats_in_downtown_toronto_for/) by a guy driving for UberEats in Toronto.

Did his homework, sums, maths, tactics to actually make money.

I know it's not Uber or Lyft, but I cant' imagine the conclusion is terribly different

> The conclusion to all this is:
​

> - Uber / Uber Eats is great - if you only do it part time, for fun, and in reasonable difficulty areas, or in an area you live in

> - Uber Eats downtown is great - on a bike, or with a very forgiving schedule on a car

> - Uber / Uber Eats is great as an emergency / last resort job

> - Uber / Uber Eats is bad as a full time job, or as income that you rely on - don't ever put yourself in this situation 

*All things considered, I almost never made less then $25/hr on Uber Eats. Obviously a statistic that is somewhat biased because I only worked at the peak pay season.*

Good read, the lengths you have to go to hustle. And he ended up getting kicked off the app... Whenever I give the argument that Uber (And delivery companies) should reimburse gas I get attacked super hard. 

Fuck Uber and Lyft (and GrubHub and doordash) Does this apply to commuting? For instance, I drive about 100 miles round trip for work.. does that mean I'm essentially costing myself close to $60 every day by choosing to drive my car? It's not uber and lyft's fault that uber drivers dont understand the concept of depreciation The Full $0.58 per mile doesn't really apply unless you the car is entirely used for Uber / Lyft. The original idea behind Uber was for people who already own a car and happen to have a few hours of free time, can use that time to make some side money, not really to be your only job or use of the car. 

Think if you are driving around for a couple of hours getting paid, vs. driving around shopping or something else instead. > No, all you're doing is turning vehicle depreciation into cash.

Yeah. You buy a cheap car that'll only last 5 years anyway then drive it into the ground over those 5 years. You don't bring a nice brand new vehicle in as your ride sharing vehicle. Uber and Lyft are great side gigs to put some extra money into your pocket as needed.

If it's you're only job AND you need the money, you're doing it wrong.

I deliver pizza on the weekends. I'm killing my car but putting $300 onto my pocket every week. At some point much sooner than I otherwise would have I'm going to have to make a major car repair but short term the money is awesome and if I were smarter I'd be tucking away 20-50 dollars every weekend to cover that inevitable break down and it wouldn't be a huge deal.

The people doing Lyft or Uber or pizza aren't thinking long term about costs. They are thinking about how much having a big wad of cash available immediately will help. The gig economy is made so the rich get richer at the expense of the poor.  This has been proven again and again by numerous studies. >The federal mileage rate is $0.58 per mile. This represents the actual cost to you and your car per mile driven.

That's an average rate, not an individual's actual rate. My dad's 230k mile 7 Series is somewhat close to that number. My old Subaru is well below it. Someone with a new S Class would be well above it. Yeah all the 2015 Hondas that have picked me up for uber sound like shit. Those engines no longer designed for 200k+ mile lifespans $.58 per mile isn't cost neutral though.  At 25mpg and $4.00 per gallon the cost of fuel is 16c per mile.  So that leaves 42c per mile to pay for depreciation and repairs.  A $25,000 car new is worth say $5000 with 150k miles.  Add another $10000 for repairs/maintenance and the cost of ownership is $30,000, or about 20c per mile for a total cost of 36c per mile with fuel. Surely they must be making some kind of money or there wouldn’t be so many drivers."
Anyone have a unicorn day? lol,51,1.6094547701958153,Lyft,Image,"That’s awesome!! I see no one else is commenting or liking. Perhaps because they’re quite jealous you had such a good day. Or perhaps because they think this is a doctored screen shot and you’re actually someone from Lyft, trying to talk it up. If the former, I’m happy for you 😂 This is cool, but just curious as to how much Lyft took? 

I recently had a 2 hour trip to a neighboring city. I made $100 and Lyft made about $80. That's awesome. You won't get much love on the subreddit. Lots of haters. you can't say one positive thing without people jumping on your throat, as I'm sure this comment will get responses similar.

But here's one fellow Lyft driver that's very happy for you. :) Awesome! Tell us about the ride? So, you went online, and immediately got a 3 hour ride request? Scheduled trip? Was it a round trip? Any tip? The ride was not scheduled, I got a warning saying it was 45 minutes plus. Turned out to be for college kids driving from Chicago to school in Indiana so it was like three hours and 130 miles. They had paid Lyft 135 I believe and pretty much slept the whole time. Then I did Uber destinations back

For whatever reason Lyft is being incredibly cheaper in Chicago at the moment as compared to Uber. I have screenshots showing Uber is been charging at least three times the price on some rides or I suppose the other way to look at it is left is charging very low prices Yesterday. $120 ride plus tip to the airport after she completed her original lyft ride with me. My 1st petsonal. Now she'll call me instead of lyft! Yeah, had a slow day on Lyft until my last ride sent me to another city at the end of my shift! $200 total is pretty good for a small city on a weekday Long rides always creeps me. The more you are driving away from your usual area, the less chances you will get someone on the way back. 

There was one time in Denver I picked up a lady on Colfax and she had to go to the Breckenridge. In snow storm. In the dark. And I had to go all the way back to the Denver through this nightmare and I've made only 74$ that ride I’ve seen a scheduled pick up for 170$ What time did you log in ? Does that time figure include the return drive these days? 

If not that's a 6 hour round trip and what, 300 miles for $125? Long run total expense in the neighborhood of 70 bucks. Net $55 for 6 hours work? I mean, you can be happy if you want, but you have to be wearing some rose-tinted glasses."
Anyone else having a bad day?😐😒,29,1.643470973899519,Lyft,Image,"My stats today were:

$82.12 this is how my activity looks every damn day lol I first started driving for Lyft in Orange County , CA when they first came to market and Lyft was pretty unknown. I had 0 rides in over 10 hours. Why are you still using Lyft? Uber clearly pays more and has better service than Lyft. I would recommend just focusing on Uber. Thats what happens when there is NO primetime or power zones or bonuses Lyft just pocketing all of that money to show a profit for there investors while they try to bend us over I rather stay in my warm bed and say Fuckem to LYFT they going out of business and sooner the later if everyone smartened up and just stopped driving for them!! Honestly you would make more money working anywhere else with less cost We can also start tweeting out to the CEO and CFO of lyft LA night crew checking in here. 27 rides for $166. Too many short rides. 8 hrs. Monday was over a hundred more for the same time investment. It’s been getting colder in the early morning hours which is nice! I just got myself a real job last week. Lyft was ok for the last 6 months. There were some weeks and days that were bad, but also had my good days.

Pretty much I figured out that, the beginning week of every month it will be slow cause everyone is paying rent, bills, etc. But the middle of the month between the 10th - 25th  it's fucking busy. I'm also a socal driver, my hours that I used to work were from 3 am to 8 am m-f taking people to work or airports, Mondays were always busy for me I'll be taking at least $125. 

So yeah I had bad days, but you will have your best days coming. Good luck $43.42, 0 tips, 8 rides, 4h online. Less than a minimum wage here in LA. My day wasn't terrible, but very long.

Weekly Challenge,4,1.8484478257624086,Lyft,"Hello everyone, 

I am a high earning driver. I complete about 150 trips a week with nearly 9k completed overall. I stopped driving for Uber because Lyft's weekly challenge bonus. I never missed a bonus, but 2 weeks ago, Lyft, told me that I am no longer eligible for the bonus. I still drive only for Lyft but I realized that driving for Uber I make more money during the same hours. I called lyft and they said that bonuses are given random, but I call it bs. Anyone else goes thru the same issue? My ratings are 5 stars and never had any issues with my riders. On uber I completed 25K trips. Please let me know if any of you have had this issue and how you delt with it?

Thanks","I'm an ""old guy.""  I remember the original Power Driver Bonus that required a certain number of rides per week, with the driver just being online during certain hours.  Not any rides, but just signed in.  Then we had to have certain number of rides during those hours.  Then the prime time hours went away and we just had to do certain number of rides.  Then it was gonna be ""personalized quests.""  Then multipliers went away.  Now all we have is the personal power zones.

&#x200B;

Each and every one of those changes dropped the amount per ride of bonus the driver got.  Every single time Lyft lied to us about how they were ""valuing our time"" and ""listening to the drivers.""  Not one change was to the driver's benefit.

&#x200B;

I'm in the Atlanta market.  I haven't seen a weekly bonus challenge in a year.  I went from 80%-20% Lyft over Uber to 90%-10% Uber over Lyft.  At least Uber gives weekly quests.  At least Uber still has surge, unlike Lyft.  At least Uber was honest about how they were assholes.  Lyft lied to us the whole time, claiming to be the company that treated the drivers better.  In my eyes, Lyft is far worse than Uber, and I have no problem telling my passengers that.

&#x200B;

I've dealt with your issue by only doing one or two Lyft rides per month, just to keep the account active.  I'll pick up any crazy Power Zones they have near me, like the random $21 bonus a month ago in west Buckhead.  But the rest of the time, Lyft is on, but I'm not online.  I'm stacking up my Uber rides, chasing that bonus.

&#x200B;

Neither company cares about how many rides you have given, nor your rating.  They.  Don't.  Care.  You need to work and drive with that in mind, and give them the exact amount of loyalty they give you: none.  You're a mercenary, act like one. Lyft is doing away with bonuses for many drivers in all markets, they need to become profitable."
My friend got into an accident,9,1.964744122069743,Lyft,"So a friend of mine who works through Lyft got into an accident. From the pictures neither side has any damage besides scuffs but he doesnt know what to do at the moment. He wasnt online so luckily. I dont know what to tell him as I havent been in this situation. From what he said, he was at fault or at least had to claim fault as he was the one who merged lanes despite his story making it seem the other driver sped up and got in his blind spot making the accident pretty unavoidable.

They exchanged insurance but I honestly doubt the guy's insurance will be issuing him the ""big bucks"" for a scratch at best.

Any who, should he tell Hertz or Lyft about it? I assume at least Hertz will find out when the other person's insurance goes through their procedure. He isnt really worried about paying for the minor damage but he is worried he will be deactivated.","Your friend Blind spots don't matter unless the other driver got a ticket, e.g., speeding.

If the total damage on both sides is less than $1000, the Hertz deductible, you should try to convince the other side to let you pay out of pocket for the repair. And you pay for your own repair. Then you don't need to report to anybody. And you can keep driving if the car is safe to drive.

For rentals, you are fully covered no matter what. There are no TOS or driver record requirements regarding accidents. There could be internal rules. But I don't think one minor incident will cause deactivation. Lyft doesn't lose money on accidents because they don't underwrite insurance. Everybody else earns money from rentals. Drivers not so much."
Jailbroken Iphone’s,12,2.176619122069743,Lyft,"Will the app still work if my phone is jailbroken? I think uber doesn’t work, but will Lyft?","Jailbreak and its detection is a cat and mouse game. You don't know what the next update will bring but that won't be the priority for the kitties in Lyft. Not sure anymore but I know Uber used to do a root/jailbreak check for their driver app and you could not use. Interestingly they also have checks in place for GPS spoofing (really quite amazing in that they use altitude data to find spoofers). Uber and, AFAIK, Lyft do not allow drivers to use rooted phones, as they may be able to install programs that spoof location and other system data. With location spoofing, drivers could pretend to be in a surge zone when they're not, for example, then virtually ""drive"" out of the surge zone with the surge still attached. So does anyone have a rooted or jailbroken iPhone, like recent, that can run the app either rider or driver? Firstly, apostrophes don't mean ""here comes an S!""  Learn to use them properly so you don't look like a moron.

Secondly, where'd you get the idea that Uber doesn't work with a jailbreak?  It works fine, both the passenger and driver apps."

When you give an exotic dancer a ride 🤷🏼‍♀️,46,2.7225797702316883,Lyft,Image,"Also bartenders. Awesome! Last time I gave a ride to a stripper she was having a bad day because she didn’t make much money that night but she was really funny. I like her. You have a sweet ass Mazda3! Strippers tip! I loved getting strippers, they were always fun to chat with and tipped really well. I have a stripper a ride once, she tipped me $20 and showed me her titties, it was a cool ride Or other Uber/Lyft Drivers.../ Seniors (That generation knows how to tip) I gotta drive by more strip clubs I had one tell me she was going to tip me in the app and guess what? everytime I give dancers a ride, they have 2 stops.... first to the ATM to deposit their wad of cash, then to their house.  Never once received a tip, just a stripper asking me to ""protect her"" (in a seductive voice) while she walks up to the atm at 3am. Lots of dancers in Houston. They hardly tip. 

I wonder if they think just because I’m in their presence, it’s tip enough. 

But most our sweet, but vary cautious, probably because of what they have to deal with. 

When I take then to work, they’ve usually just woken up and are making calls before their shift. Did that a few times. Every time my back seat was covered in glitter. Yeah most likely that was in her sweaty thong. But hey money is money. Yes the ladies are really nice! They call me MAW! I love it! I gave a ride to a stripper once. She gave me a fake $100 I’m surprised they weren’t glittery. wow, never got a tip from one. Only bartenders I had a stripper pax, she was talking on the phone and I overheard her saying she makes $900 on a sat night, god fucking damn. No tip of course Just a ride ? I wanted to build a stripper book of customers for exactly this reason. Figured it would organically dovetail into escorts and tricks.

Alas, I got a real job again and have moved onto other ideas/ventures, but a reliable confidential driver for that scene would have to clean up. Smell em! Any body glitter in the back seat?  If not, you got lucky. [deleted]"

Never done ride share a day in my life - Advice for n00b please,14,2.8537140295130237,Lyft,"Hi.

I have never used Lyft (or any other rideshare service) but this week I'll be flying to a conference and need transportation from the airport to the hotel. Any advice?

Are there any coupons for first-time riders?

EDIT: I'll be doing this as a rider, not a driver.","Best advice is to always make sure to pee whenever you get an oppotunity If you type in lyft rider promo you should see something like first ride x amount off or first 5 rides 5 dollars off. Be sure to tip! It's a pretty easy experience. As long as you have your checking and routing numbers to put into the app, it's really pretty self explanatory. Be sure and ask the driver how long they’ve been driving for Lyft. Would you ride ""shotgun"" or back seat? Haven't even use it yet and aredy asking for coupon use  yellow cab"
Anyone have issues with Donlen?,9,2.864339029526821,Lyft,"So ive only had this vehicle for a couple weeks but have had several issues mainly brakes. It took the last 2 appointments to get something done as they kept saying there was nothing wrong. 

Today seems to be the worst as I have waited over 4 hours to get a yes from Donlen. Seems like it shouldnt take that long. Finally after leaving I came back after speaking with Lyft about this and trying to at least see if I could get a reasonable lower rental for the week to cover today loss wages and after they said no I hear the yes came through. 

Just gonna say dont expect much from Donlen. I do hope I can find a new job soon so I dont have to deal with crappy Lyft and their terrible partners. 

Also,  it seems they really do the least amount done on these vehicles. I mean who does the bare minimum for brakes?!","Using any rental program for more then a stop gap is dumb.

They prey on people like you.

You should never beable to do this job if you can't even own your own vehicle.

Future BIL wants to keep wallet full of money left behind by passenger. How do I change his mind?,34,2.9366654184157097,Lyft,"My fiance and I think it's morally gross to intentionally keep a wallet full of money especially if he knows who it belongs to, ID included. Since morals won't sway his position, does anyone have stories of drivers getting in trouble for this? I know theft by finding is at least a misdemeanor in most states especially if it's proven that he didn't make reasonable attempts to find the owner. Given that he drove this passenger and has ways to contact him, it seems easy to prove he intended to steal this. Am I being dramatic or is this a dick move at best, and reason to get booted from lyft at worst?","At least return the wallet with the ID's and shit. If it were my wallet I'd care more about my cards and ID than the money. His integrity is only worth a couple hundred dollars, or less?  Must not think very highly of himself. It is a crime. Nothing more, nothing less. If you want to sleep at night, you will have to do the right thing by your standards. 

I personally wouldn't rest easily unless I got in contact with the owner and let them know what was going on, or the authorities and Lyft to inform at least two of the three. Just as a contrast, a guy left his wallet in my car a few months ago. I didn’t notice until I was a few miles away. I went back to return it but the drop off point was super dark and I wasn’t sure which unit they’d gone into. I contacted the rider via social media. By the time we got in touch, the guy had left town. I mailed it back to him, with everything still inside including $40 cash. Not all drivers are douche canoes. Most aren’t. \- the dude may not be a fucking thief outright, but he obviously can not be trusted if left in a room with your personal valuables for a moment.

Next time he's hanging with you and you all have to run home to change or something....

Sorry dude - you need to wait outside. You can't come in. You know why. I know it's raining - here's a newspaper. No I am not fucking kidding.

By the way, this is exactly what you say to him if you tell me to  fuck off and ignore my advice. (as requested: how do you get him to realize this matters + change his mind?)

THis is how you do it. He obviously doesn't care what a stranger thinks of him, but he certainly cares what family thinks. If he realizes ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES, then it dawns on him. Ding!

If he doesn't care: add Sociopath. Keep that uncle away from offspring at all costs. Explain this to him as well - yes, we connect the dots. If you can't see this is morally wrong, and are a morally bankrupt person, why would we expose our children to you?

When he expresses his surprise, hold up a mirror in front of him. Yep, I understand - you certainly look surprised. We're just as surprised as you  - THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE this conversation with you.

You and your brother are not 10 anymore. It's not cute. It's not a good look.

What is your reputation worth? Decide. Right now. Is the fuzziness going away?

I for one would be curious as to his response and the outcome.

&#x200B;

Or , you know - you could blackmail him for honeymoon money. Make a nice Lifetime  movie of the week script =0)    /s Karma can bite you in the ass or save your ass, thats what I would be worried about. The fact he told you is a positive. He apparently has some doubt or he wPuls not have said anything.  You need to pressure him.  What if it the only cash customer had and was paying rent or bills or child support with that money.  Maybe it’s a well to do person who’s connected and already talking to Uber or Lyft about having him removed from platform. Maybe it’s a drug dealer who knows he left it in your brother in His vehicle and retribution is on its way.  Sad it comes down to this.  Again, he told you so there is some doubt about keeping it. Pressure him I sell handicrafts at various conventions and festivals.  I've had my share of phones, wallets, and credit cards left behind at my table.  Sometimes it's other shoppers who notice the item first, and hand it to me (every time that happens, faith in humanity goes up a point).  I make a note of the make/model of the phone, or the name on the ID / CC, and stow it behind my table.  When someone comes up and asks me about the lost item, I ask them to describe the phone / give me the name and address on the ID / give me the name and type of credit card, before giving it back, to make sure it's going to the rightful owner.  


I never, ever steal cash or IDs / cards or record card numbers.  I don't steal phones.  JFK, who would do this?  Your future BIL, apparently.  


I've had people walk away after a cash transaction before I've given them their change.  I always get up and run after them to give it to them.  I've had people accidentally give me an extra dollar; I always give it back.  


I do all that because *that's the kind of world I want to live in.*  I don't expect to get repaid in karma, but I know my actions have made other people's lives a little bit better, and that the effect may ripple outwards, and that alone is totally worth it. Yeah that’s pretty scummy. Also it’s illegal. The Lyft terms of service make clear that drivers are not responsible for left items, but the moral responsibility is clear. If that doesn't sway him, you might remind him that he can be deactivated as a driver for failure to return an item. He probably can't be prosecuted, but he'll likely lose his job. How does his future spouse feel about it? See if you can get a look at the ID, maybe even talk him into giving you the license to return as ""found on sidewalk"" to the cops, then tell them the whole story.  I can't stand thieves. Sorry. Report him to Lyft if you haven't already. Turn him in to Lyft or Uber.  Drivers who do this, give us all a bad reputation.  I found a wallet the next day underneath front passenger seat when cleaning up car.  14 hours had past and I had no customer communications regarding lost items. The customer did not report, because he figured whoever found it kept the cash.  There was $620 in cash, BLACK AMEX, several other cards, ss card and drivers license.  It was an attorney for a very well known Philly Rapper who had appeared at NOTO on a Saturday night.  
Went to LinkedIn, found his contact and messaged him. Customer had wallet back within 90 minutes. Good things have happened ever since and I’m grateful.  
I’m retired (mid50’s)from a 33 year successful career in corporate.   I started driving after 4 1/2 years of too much time on my hands.  Again, wallet owner was grateful and new friendships found.  Must admit I was shaking when I found it and viewed the contents. Not even a doubt to do right thing.  Yes he rewarded me very generously, because he did right thing especially thinking he’d never see it again. Me?  I donated money to a foundation I volunteer time when not driving. 

Sorry someone has to think about doing the right thing.  Tell him good chance customer will di right thing. Especially since there was more than just cash.  Loosing your ID is very worrisome.  So much more bad can come from this such as identity fraud. You need to have heart to heart with brother in law.  You never know who your dealing with.  If the person who lost the wallet is a bad person, than potential retribution may be in its way to your future brother in law.  Lyft SND Uber provides customers with our info.  So be-careful if you think you can get away by keeping a persons property. Just mind your business!!!, that's it"
"Express Drivers...do you go for the rental rewards, or cherry pick as you please?",5,3.1666306962045256,Lyft,"  
I'm  trying to make this express drive thing work financially. I hate renting, but I need to make it work somehow. Otherwise I'll never be able to get my car fixed, or get a new one.   


Two Uber renters I spoke to say they always go for Uber's rental bonus. Do Lyft Express Drivers do the same  with rental rewards? I can do 85 rides for $75. The top two tiers (105 for $45) and (135 for another $80) seem nearly impossible for me.   


I would have to take a lot of short rides and Shared rides, and that seems counterproductive. But is that the key to making money with Express Drive? What am I missing?  


I know some will say there's no way to make money renting, or that I should get a 9 to 5. But like I said, right now I have no other options. I just quit my 9 to 5 for family reasons. I have to make this work and I'm trying to figure it all out. Thanks for sharing your wisdom!","Lyft stopped doing Rental rewards on September 9th and unless you signed up before that time then you're not eligible. 

In my experience it was extremely difficult to make any real money with lyft Express. 

First there's a $250 rental deposit so now you are already spending money to make money (and it can take up to two weeks for the deposit to be returned back to you). Then on top of that lyft is going to take more money from each ride you give so you'll actually be earning less and before you can cash out you have to earn enough to cover Rental charges. 

I understand you are in a tough spot but I think lyft express should be akin to selling your soul to the devil. They will also charge you $37 on the day you return your car regardless if it's the end of the rental cycle. I just get out and drive every day in busy areas and mostly after the rush hour traffic. Short rides are never good money unless they tip $5. I like getting medium to long rides with little or no deadheading. If it’s possible in your area. 

Express drive is not the best program but if it’s your only option then you can make it work for you. 

I try to get in about 15 to 20 rides a day which ensures I hit all levels of the bonus, but it’s tiring and if you want a day or two off forget reaching all the bonuses. Unless you can cherry pick rides that end up paying you more than the bonus (which you can't) there's no reason to not get the rewards bonus. Just take every ride (almost every ride) and be online as much as possible. Im my city, rental is $240/week, you'd be paying $1000 a month just to rent a car without the rewards might as well finance a car. But now it's impossible even with rewards with the rate cuts and lowered rewards. I got lucky and did it for a few months before the rate cuts. You'd be losing money now. When I did it the reward was $195, now its $160(could be lower now) the rental was $240/week, it was barely manageable, my market is 60c/mile, express drive is now 44c/mile. I had to work 10-12 hrs and consistently waited hours between rides just to make $75-100 on average and make another account to do fake rides to meet the ride requirement. I also had to accept long pick ups and wait until they cancel to keep my acceptance rate up. Glad I got my own car now"
"Tonight's WTF ride: The cops put three girls in my car, who appeared to be drunk and underage.",29,3.211804307315637,Lyft,"Around 2:30 am this morning I got pinged to a gated community. I almost cancelled at the gate because it took the security guard about 10 minutes to let me in, but I was trapped with cars behind me, so I had to wait anyway.

As I pulled up to the cul-de-sac, there were at least three police cruisers and maybe 10 people outside, apparently waiting for rides.

An officer asked me who I was there for, I told him the female name on the app, he called out the name, and a female officer came over with three young women.

She asked me to verify the two addresses on the app with the riders, and told me to make sure they got home safe. Okay.

One (or all of them) had an obvious alcohol smell, but I didn't think much of it until one of them started calling other people who were at the party and asking things like ""do you think you'll get in trouble with your mom?"" and ""we need to coordinate our answers"".

That led me to believe they might be underage, so I asked the one sitting in the front seat which college they went to, and she told me the name of a high school.

I asked if anyone was over 18. Crickets. Then one in the back said she'll be 18 in December. To be fair, there was one sleeping in the back who I don't think spoke during the entire trip. She might have been over 18 or maybe even over 21, but that's not the impression I got.

By then we were four minutes from the first stop, so there was no use in turning back.

From what I gathered a neighbor called the police over loud noise. I'm not sure what steps the cops took after they got there, but these girls appeared to have been drinking, and appeared to be under age to ride without an adult as well.

I was paying attention to the female officer, so I didn't see the faces of the riders as they got in the car to determine how young or old they looked, but ultimately I was the one who was put at risk.

Perhaps the officers looked the other way because this happened in an upper class neighborhood? I don't know. Or maybe they did their due diligence and the girl that was sleeping was indeed old enough to drink and she was the one who smelled like booze. And if she was over 18 or 21, that would make the ride perfectly legal I guess. But in the moment I didn't get that impression.

I will send Lyft a detailed note of what happened just to have it documented, although I know they don't care and will do nothing.

This is not the first time the cops put drunk people in my car, but this one seemed excessively weird by all accounts, especially for a Monday morning. Each day I learn a new lesson. Next time I'll be sure to ask the police officers all necessary questions.

\*Edited for clarity and deleted names and locations","Apparently some cops don't know or dont really care about the underage rule for Uber/Lyft.

I once drove a pax home and drove by a middle school letting out for the day. I was stopped at a crosswalk where a cop was assisting those crossing the street. Some kid tried opening my door, i looked at him and shook my head ""no"" and tried to drive away but then the cop knocked on my window, I'm guessing he thought I was his Uber, for that obviously underage kid.

I told him that I wasn't his ride and drove off, but I was surprised the cop was trying to get me to let the kid in thinking I was his uber. Firstly everyone commenting in this must have brain damage 

Secondly never take underage kids without an adult, if you wreck your car and they get hurt lyft and uber won’t cover it if it’s your fault 

Thirdly why the fuck would you let cops put people in your car.....  

Enough said Happened to me once when I pulled up to a resort around 8 PM. I saw a woman falling down and fighting with security. Can't be my ride. Oh yes it was. I was pinned in and the security started pulling on my locked door handle demanding I pick her up and get her off the premises. My response was no fugging way and get your hands off of my car. Head of security yells that if I don't take her I will be banned from the resort. I am now out of my car telling him I don't give a rat's ass while she is still flailing away and screaming profanities at me. Finally a real cop ( Boca Raton) enters the scene and asks why I won't take her if I am the Lyft driver.I point at her and tell him NFW am I taking that wild woman in my car to please the same hotel that let her get in that condition in the first place. He agrees and clears the path for me to leave. I would quit before i would take that shit ride. Just say no fuggin way and drive off. You are not compelled to take that pax by cops or company. Let the cops drive them home. I wouldn't do this I pulled up on a trendy bar street and throw on the hazards in a designated waiting area. Cop taps my window and I'm thinking it's to tell me to GTFO, instead he says ""are you the uber? This is your ride"" and points to some guy sprawled out unconscious on a park bench. Yeah fuck that, I tell him ""sorry sir I cant take an unconscious passenger."" He glares at me but doesnt say anything and talks to his partner. I do not care what he comes back with, no way in hell is this guy getting in my car. Eventually I have to hollar at the cop and say ""sir am I free to go?"" and he doesnt really acknowledge me. I ask again and I know he hears me so I slowly start to idle away and that was the end of it. I know the cops appreciate us ""helping out"" in matters like this, but I'm not an adult babysitter and they're well aware of why I dont want him, for the same reason *they* dont! ""we need to coordinate our answers.""?  These kids work for Interpol or something? If you can help an inebriated youngster get back to his or her place,  do it.  All this crying ""not getting in my car!?!!"".  Be a Human.  A lot of us have been there, have woken up with anxiety shame and thanked whatever God let your head hit the pillow. First off the rules for underage passengers is not a law.  It's simply a policy of Uber and Lyft that they could give two shits about.  Kids take public transportation every day of the week by themselves.  Secondly, what kinda people fear a liability risk for watching over a drunk juvenile get home safely especially after a cop puts them in the car.  People have become subhuman with no care or consideration for anyone or anything except themselves...   I don't run my life by the terms of service of any company.  The heavenly father writes my TOS.  And if you don't feel comfortable or trust yourself with young drunk girls, then you have bigger problems than liability issues. What’s the problem? I’m sure cops have been putting drunk people in cabs for decades. Police officers override all driving laws. If an officer tells you to do a driving thing that would ordinarily be illegal, say, driving through a red light, you are not only allowed but obligated to do so. If you had refused, the officer could have arrested you on the spot and impounded your car."
So are other drivers also paid cancellation rate based on how many miles they drove to pick up somebody and how long it took,16,3.445589029537859,Lyft,Image,"Yeah, they have some basis for this, but basically you get paid extra on cancels if you have to drive longer than what may be typically expected. Uber does something similarly.  
I drove a half hour to pick up a guy once, and it was supposed to be an hour and a half long ride. He literally cancelled as I was pulling into the hotel parking lot. I got like 18 bucks for the cancel. I drove 10 min to pick up location. Waited 10 min. The passenger was a no-show. Lift paid a flat $5 and didn't log the travel and wait time.[WTH](https://i.imgur.com/PkdWkOn.png) They didn't actually pay you extra for time and distance, just charged the customer extra and kept the difference. You see that, right?

New lows. I see they make money even on cancellations now.  Wow.  I can see charging a extra 5 cancellation fee and giving to the driver.  But making money while the driver had all the expense, shows a big FU to the drivers and customers."

Sounds like you've been #lyfted.


Should of taken a screen shot of progress so you had proof of a promo!

It's funny how a glitch only ends in favor or lyft. How is it a scam. I started Lyft September 1st and had a 1000$ guarantee on 125 rides. I finished the rides sep 18th and only had Made 650$. On my 125th ride Lyft tacked on an extra 350$... it was pretty nice. Did you contact Lyft?

The dude in the back was like hey are we at a stop sign or a stop light. Then my brain started working again and I went home after that ride. I didnt get a tip. FML!","Oh man, I kinda did this the other day.

I picked up a passenger that was going pretty close to my apartment, and I needed to go straight through an intersection but to get to my place I would have made a right turn at that intersection.  
I totally spaced out and went into autopilot and turned like I was going home, the passenger was like ""uhhh... Hey, where are you going?"" It was a younger girl and she sounded a little nervous.  
I apologized profusely and explained to her I lived nearby and it had been a long day and I was thinking about going home after I dropped her off and just got ahead of myself. Luckily she understood and laughed it off. This is a warning, both you guys driving too much. Take breaks, get out and stretch. This could result in an accident. Stay safe.

I've stopped at a stop sign waiting for the light to change before, and with a pax.  Super embarrassing. Lol definitely do this, I don't even think I'm that tired, just a brain fart here and there. Always have a laugh to myself though. well, the described behavior kinda definitionally means you didn't deserve a tip, so, at least on that last one no surprise. I do this all the time, sat there for a good while thinking ""this is hell of a long light"" literally was just a 3 way stop one a one way. I've done this a couple of times haha Exactly."
"It's the little victories, really.",4,3.674350603636768,Lyft,"So last night I run someone from the club to their house in the suburbs. Kinda messed up my  flow of quick little down trips and now I was faced with driving all the way back into the city without a fare. I got a ping for a ride that was 18 minutes away. I did some quick calculations and figured that they had to be going to the airport, which even though it was a long drive to them, the fare to the airport would make everything worth it.   


So I drive to their house, they give me the gate code to their neighborhood, I pull up, call them, tell them that I arrive, and then I wait. and wait. The timer runs out and instead of calling them again, I just gun it. I don't care anymore. I'm tired of these people treating my time like it's worthless.   


As I speed away I see them come flying out of their house with their luggage, screaming for me to stop.   


Have fun finding another driver in your neighborhood at 3am.","You should've gotten paid a decent cancellation fee. Collect it, sit close by and get their ping again. If you can't calm the paxhole down, simply cancel at the end of the trip with passenger behavior as the reason. Congratulations! You have been compensated for all those miles you drove."
How do you guys react when someone asks you if this is your primary job?,39,3.7446515295626943,Lyft,Like what should I say?,"Lmao your going to hear that alot ..""so is this all you do"" like it's not an honest job and I'm out hear selling crack 😂 The truth maybe? Some people do it as a side job and some do it full time. What's the big deal? Tell them you're picking up extra hours because your girl is pregnant... Or you just had a kid.

Watch the tips flow in. Worked for me. I wasn't lying but it seemed to help... And changed the conversation Sometimes I like to say that in my not rideshare time I'm a process server and I'll turn around and go your last name is not Jones is it? I'm usually a bit of a dick and treat them the same way, I think most people catch on.

&#x200B;

Typically we're already conversing and I've already asked what the passenger does.

Passenger: ""So is this your only job?""

Me: ""Yes, How about you, just scientific research, that's all?""

&#x200B;

Another one:

""So is this all you do?""

""Noooo.. I tame tigers and organize orgies on the side"" I say I’m just doing it while looking for another job. It’s an annoying conversation about what I studied and what I’m looking for, but I’ve gotten a few business cards in the past with a “check out my company’s website and email me if there’s something you want to apply for.” Haven’t had any luck with those specific companies, but still hoping some future passenger has a magical connection for me. I make up elaborate lies. Or I say yes and I only have to drive about 30 hours a week to live the good life. Pays way more then my last job! (I also have quite a bit of passive income) but I dont say that part. It is my only job, so I just tell them that. Never had any snide remarks or anything “Fuck no fuck lyft lol” I used to say ""I also do some consulting part-time"" & then ask them a question if I wanted to quickly change the subject (I always enjoyed talking about the passengers more than talking about myself). Besides, it's not exactly a lie...I'm consulting Reddit right now. “Yes” just to avoid the third degree about my life. I tell them the truth, I need flexible income while I’m in school, I don’t want to do people’s taxes so I’m getting an accounting degree, I’ll happily help you do yours for $500 per form, but I can’t legally talk about your tax situation any longer without a letter of engagement to protect you. “Nah I’m a gm at a Victoria’s Secret”

I’m a dude Is it your primary job? Answer however you want. How about yes? “I’d be living in here if so” Proud to have a Job I like with lots of freedom,  no deadlines, no fixed schedule . I listen the music I like. I Talk to interesting people, i have more vacations and days off than never and top of all these I make money . I really like messing with people, so I’ve considered coming up with elaborate stories. However, I just tell them the ol “I’m in school, this is an easy flexible way to have some extra spending cash, blah, blah, blah. 

I do find that those who talk to me extensively about school and that nursing is a great field also tip well. Guess I should stick to the real story since it’s benefiting me sometimes, lol. Tell them your retired and you have to o much time on your hands.  Works for me, because it’s true.  Been retired 5 years.  Love doing this.  Better than getting calls from HR about employee issues or board ember question decision making and impact.  Honestly, I got luck in tech and retired in my 50’s.  I get tips.  I only drive Lux and Black XL’s.  Or tell them you’re inventor and just filed patent but you drive for money to file more patents.  If they ask what you invent, tell them virtual reality sex and sex toys.  Than ask them if they want to learn how to mentally masturbate. That's only the premium lift cars whatever they're called or Uber black the sells crack most of the regular drivers sell oranges or tomatoes i tell them whether or not it is my primary job I say I’m a certified cross guard. That causes slight confusion lol I tell them I’m independently wealthy and I just do this for fun. They're trying to measure your status in society. Just tell them ""oh no  I just do a few rides in the evening for some extra cash, I'm actually a computer technician"" or whatever."
Do hot spots distinguish between types of lyfts?,1,3.794848288821953,Lyft,"I dont know if I'm using the right terminology, but you know when spots of the map are covered in cheeto dust, and by the time you get to them they're gone,those shits. I was in one of them and I wasnt really getting any rides. I'm typically a shared lyft or like lower tier I guess, so I wonder if those areas are just ordering a lot of different lyft's that arent me.","They really don't mean anything, they just indicate where Lyft ***expects*** it to be busy, not where it actually is busy.  
Given that, I would assume that it's not distinguishing, but I would imagine that most rides are the standard Lyft, or shared if you are in a larger metro, so it would be safe to assume that Lyft is expecting those kinds of rides the be the majority.

But again, those don't denote actual amounts of rides needed/requested, just that there were a few rides in a short span and so Lyft expects there to be more rides coming soon."
Hey guys I'm about to start driving but I want to use my gf car but it's under her name and so it's the insurance does it matter? Or does the registration and insurance have to be under my name??,48,3.835577455496898,Lyft,,"Insurance I believe yes, you have to be under covered person. Registration no.

The inside of the Lyft smelled like crack,41,3.9598367147561575,Lyft,"I take a Lyft at lease once a week, so at least 100 times. Never had a problem. The other day I got in the Lyft, a newer Toyota RAV4 and it had a very very strong fresh smell of crack. I could smell it immediately. The driver had 5.0 star review and I really needed to get to where I was going to I didn’t say anything. He opened the window and so did I because it was so strong I was afraid I would inhale too much. I don’t know if he thought I wouldn’t know what the smell was because the average person wouldn’t, but I happen to know the smell very well. Later on I gave one star and commented “you’re car smelled like crack”","I for one don't know what crack smells like, so couldn't tell you. How do you know that this smell belonged to the driver instead of the most recent passenger?  Did his speech or driving suggest a problem?  Did he roll the window down before you did, or right after, because he knows that having just one rear window down creates a buffeting noise in his vehicle?  Even if he rolled his window down first, it's entirely possible that he smelled *a* smell without knowing what it was and that he was silently cursing his previous passenger.

I'm a tall, bald guy.  If you smell women's perfume in my rideshare car or see a long hair on the seat, is it more reasonable to assume that they belong to me - the driver - or to a previous passenger?

Unless you had some evidence that the crack belonged to the driver, you just threatened a person's livelihood for no good reason. Of course a Lyft pax would know the smell of crack cocaine very well. What, did you one star because he didn’t offer you any? Degenerate. OP, You were smelling yourself! But did you die, though? I've had people do illegal things in my car with out my permission. It's very possible he just kicked out someone who light up in his car. Only a user of crack would know what it smells like.... Your calling yourself out..  sorry it gave you withdrawals so you gave a 1 star. Weed > crak is wack yo How do you know what crack smells like Why are you gloating about your 60k job? I’m pretty surprised by all the ignorant comments. I honestly think this guy assumed he could smoke crack and get away with it because he was picking me up at a building that is half expensive apartments and half fancy offices and was dressed in my nice work clothes and I work in the offices and he must have assumed that a passenger from there wouldn’t recognize the smell and probably 99.95% wouldn’t, but he happened to get the one and only who would know the smell. Piece of shit move IMO."
So people can falsely report you speeding and get you deactivated?,7,4.023783474026455,Lyft,Far as i know I’m not deactivated as of right now but someone reported speeding. I don’t speed. I do not understand how people take rides and falsely report people. What kind of investigation can lyft do? Does it record your speed ?,"Somebody falsely reported me (a driver) of something and got my account deactivated for a couple hours. Reason it was only a couple hours was because I went into rider mode and falsely accused a driver a i recently took a trip with. Yeah, they can deactivate you simply on hearsay. Yeah, it sucks, get in touch with them if you feel strongly about it and tell them your side. Tell them this is not a pattern of ongoing behavior and you have never had an issue prior to this trip. It’s possible the rider just didn’t like you. I’ve been getting more and more of this lately- particularly after high minute/low mile fares with very anti social pax.

I’m pretty much done with the gutter trash Lyft crowd Passengers can make whatever shit they want to about you and it sucks. The other day I picked up this lady at the hospital. Here the hospital is huge and has like 19383737299273 different entrances. She just put the physical address in and didn’t move the pin to where she was actually at. I showed up to the pin and of course she called bitching that it said I arrived but she couldn’t see me. I said I’m at the pick up pin where it told me to go. So I drove 3 blocks down to where she was just because I get like being nice when I could have sat there and and just collected the 5$ but the trip was going to be Atleast 10. When she got in the car she was obviously flustered but I showed her on the rider app how to move the pin to avoid the situation again and I told her I’m not suppose to be driving around looking for her and that I don’t get paid for the ride if I don’t go to the pick up and I could have just sat there and left and collected 5$. I guess the bitch got offended and told Lyft I tried to ask her to pay me in cash and turn of the app and said I had friends In the car and the back seat was covered in trash. The stupid bitch went all in. They simply send you a report trying to get you to admit to doing something. If you fight it and theres no real evidence,  they really dont do anything unless theres multiple reports.  One woman tried it, claiming i was speeding,  swerving, narrowly missing cars...such bullshit. The thing is i was just taking her home from work and i followed her directions, i have no idea why she would bother. Some pax have problems. And you can’t fight it because they can’t give you any Information on the ride"

Involved in an accident...,16,4.088031159222678,Lyft,"I was found at fault. Reported it to my regular insurance and Lyft, as well. I spoke with both of them. Regular insurance knows I had passengers but don't currently know they were rideshare passengers. What happens now?","So right now it looks like the consensus is to keep my fucking mouth shut and just maybe it will work itself out? Progressive isn't going to cover your commercial activities.

Lyft certainly covers your liability but damage to your car is tricky. If the damage to your car is under $2500, that doesn't matter. The best case is that you have a valid comprehensive policy uploaded, you are covered and Lyft will pay the excess over the deductible. People don't post clear details on this.

My experience on Uber is that Uber(James River) pays the damage to my car. So why do they have to check my other insurance policy? I am fully insured so the two insurance companies may have some communications behind me. But to me, it looks like, ""you have pax, you are covered, this is your adjuster writeup online and you can take this and your car to repair paying the deductible.""

The alternative is don't tell Progressive that you are Lyfting. Progressive will ask you the standard if you are doing any rideshare no matter what. If you answer yes that's the end of story. Wait and let see what happens next. Otherwise, whatever you answer they are not going to investigate without reason. That's a standard question. So if you have a police report you can see what's on it. And also which insurance card you show the police and the other party. The other party may or may not know that you are Lyfting. Your pax may claim some medical conditions that turn up late, he/she may also report to Lyft for a refund.

I still don't understand what means by being ""dropped"" by Progressive. I don't care a bit if they don't accept me as a customer anymore if they pay up. It's a nightmare they don't pay when nobody else pay. Is it on the police report that you were doing Lyft? This is why Personal Ride Share Insurence is a necessity. Its not required but if anything happens your gonna need it. Prepare to be dropped by your insurance"
Tipping Question,5,4.0943737518152705,Lyft,"Headed to DisneyWorld and plan to skip renting a car.  I've zero ride-share use and have a basic etiquette question.  
$10 tip from MCO to Disney Springs?  20% or so from Disney Springs to Magic Kingdom or at least $3?  I know it's probably been asked but whats ""reasonable""?","Anything at all will be appreciated, especially if it's in cash. We all know that so few carry cash these days that it's an extra special ""treat"" when we do get those cash tips... but in app tips are definitely appreciated as well!

That said, anything at all is awesome. 20% or at least $3 is great for standard trips. If the trip is extra long or traffic-y or the driver goes out of their way to help you out somehow (luggage, stops) or anything like that, it's not a bad idea to throw in a little extra. Also if you're taking the driver away from the busy area, consider some extra tip here as well. They'll have to go back to the busy area likely without a passenger and therefore don't get paid for that time or mileage. not a lyft answer but WDW has an excellent bus system...you can take their shuttle buses to any park and any resort hotel and Disney springs for free. Picking up riders at the end of the day at Disney is terrible, traffic jams, giant crowds, cars stuck in lanes and forced to keep moving by cops, so make sure you have your phone out and are where the pin has you and that you are looking for the car, $10 tip for leaving Disney, for other rides a couple of bucks is fine. See if your hotel includes a shuttle, the buses at Disney are nice/simpler. Those are all acceptable. There is no ettiquete."

How do you tell if a driver is suspended? Or no longer driving?,14,4.298297362940179,Lyft,"Hi Reddit --

I am hoping someone could provide some clarity on how to tell if a Lyft driver is still active or not.

If a driver is suspended or their account is no longer active, can a passenger click on their Ride History and see the driver's profile picture? Or is it just a empty placeholder?

I attached a screenshot of an old Ride History. See how everyone's pictures shows up and you can click on any one of them to get more details on the Trip History. If the driver in question was no longer driving (suspended or whatever), will their picture still appear there? Or nah?

Anyone have experience with this -- whether it's a PAX or driver who was suspended for a short time?

https://i.redd.it/y8dz4vp3iwq31.png","Did you get groped? No, it does not change that picture or anything after the fact. I had a driver 2 times, and he changed his picture at some point between, and in the ride history it shows the picture from the time of the ride. I don’t know for sure but I doubt that Lyft would provide that information to a passenger/customer...why do you care tho? You haven’t even taken a Lyft in forever..."
Anyone else getting these notifications on every trip?,14,4.420276529606846,Lyft,Image,"Chicago, I only get them for +45min rides.   

Personally, I always take them unless it's **much** less than a hour before I want to sign off and go home (including the glaringly obvious deadhead that is totally their own fault).

I'd think that lyft's servers would EVENTUALLY figure out that I go offline at 12:30 -1:00am local and go to destination mode to home and take that into account, but I guess that their programmers aren't paid enough to be that smart.    

It's a pity they arent' smart enough to either ask me or use the OBVIOUS data to assist both their customers and their drivers to their own benefit. I get those on UBER but not lyft, makes it so easy to decide if u want the trip or not. I love it! Basically because you're 90% acceptance rating or higher you get that for being a good little boy... My AR use to be 15% now it's 100%. The only change made was not signing on for three  weeks. I totally expect it to tumble when i get back home.

My first Ride challenge,5,4.899431622210476,Lyft,"So I see my first ride challenge and apparently they want me to do 131 rides for $142 dollars. -_-

Hell.. at 3 dollars per ride, that nets you $291.

To me, these are only fun when you know lyft will be paying the difference. In this case they will not. I'd bang that shit out. Uber gave me two quests this week. One was for $185 for 80 and second is $75 for 60. I'm getting both. Next week I have another lucrative quest."
Got a couple of stories to share with you...,3,4.937093659258551,Lyft,"Might have to get ready for a wall of text. Tbh I wasn’t gonna tell this tale before, outta sheer laziness,  but the way it broke my heart just compelled me to. 
I just couldn’t help but feel empathy for the callers. 
Thought that I got lucky I never was in any of those situations, I could’ve easily been, as I used to drive with simple liability and I’m a lone migrant who needed an entry level job while he settled down in the US. I have lived in the US for a whopping 2 years. Used to drive, didn’t have many options. Had a racist manager who hated Hispanics, so I figured hey... lyft can’t be worse than that, right? 
First of all, let’s just say I’m in a position (now) where I see lots of insurance claims. Obviously I can’t discuss specific names or dates, and I gotta be as vague as possible, but these two tales are 100% true. 

First call was a Mexican driver, calling insurance company to try and find a way to have someone take responsibility for his car. He shares his tale
He dropped off someone at the airport while doing uber and started heading home. He runs a red light and hits a car. Admits to the wrongdoing, after all, he knew it was his fault. He doesn’t give it a second thought. I have full coverage he thinks, and apologizes and exchanges information with the other driver. 

Later finds out his insurance refuses to pay any damages , “ you were in the app, it’s Uber’s responsibility ( yes first tale was an uber driver, second was a lyft driver) “ he, desperately calls the other company, the one that insured the person he hit. “ why are you claiming I was logged into uber while I was driving, it’s not true, plz tell my insurance it isn’t true so they fix my car “ 
All he receives is a “ this is what uber claims, not us, we can’t do anything” 
His car was a 2019, probably just bought it, on which he owed a lot of money, and as he stated many times, the source of income of his family. The only source, which he needs fixed asap. 
He just breaks down before they hung up. 
I can’t say for sure if he was logged on or not, I have no access to that data. 
I can say, however, that the second story was way more tragic.  At least for me...Because... 

Well, second caller was a lyft driver. I believe Dominican he had full coverage. He was calling his own insurance company, and was connected to a claims rep about an accident. They were apparently denying coverage entirely.  This is what he said “ when I got insurance to drive for lyft, your sales rep told me I needed a special insurance, that cost $50 extra a month, I pay almost $300 a month to be fully insured, why won’t you fix my car? “ 

Some other driver hit him, he was 0% liable for the accident. However, he had passengers and was in the middle of a lyft drive. 
His rep explained “ the coverage you signed up for only protects you in the event that you are logged into the app but have no passengers. The moment you pick up somebody, it’s lyft’s responsibility” 
He began swearing. Yelling, saying lift is doing nothing, that he is losing wages. That he won’t be able to pay rent, feed his family, anything “
Please, I can’t wait, I need my car, I paid you so much in insurance” . He was in complete disbelief that his $300 monthly insurance would not cover any damages in an accident that he was 0% liable for. He just begun breaking down. The conversation went in circles , with the same statement just being said over and over. You are not covered. 

There is a third story. One girl told me how she had an accident and it took about 4 months before lyft repaid her like $20,000 of out-of-pocket expenses. And never returned it entirely. 
This was back when I still drove for lyft, and she was my passenger. 
Before I made the decision to sell my car and do a 9-5 and never look back. 
Never been better, and I feel for the people here stuck doing it. Just get out of it while you can, there is a lot of fine print that just might fuck you up. 

TLDR... 
save yourself","Doesn't make a lot of sense. He doesn't have rideshare. The most likely case he reported it to Uber and somehow his insurance company knows about it. Could have easily avoided. Less likely is that his Uber sticker is all over the place so the other party just gets it into the records. Or the police. The other driver and his insurance company shouldn't have cared because it makes no difference to them. Uber couldn't have claimed anything because once it know that it's not responsible it couldnt care less.

2nd case, Lyft is responsible so why he's crying? But ... a normal insurance company will pay immediately and sort out the fault and deductable later but I'm not so sure about Lyft. Same goes for the 3rd."
99% of the Lyft drivers and riders will never read this part of the new terms of agreement.,10,5.09385291851781,Lyft,Image,"Woot. Time to sell these iPhones. [removed] Woooooooooooow. Thank you for posting this, you’re absolutely right I would have never seen this. Husband rivers for Lyft sometimes and we both use it as passenger as well so this is good to know!"
Am I getting to work today?,30,5.206341344457534,Lyft,Image,"That's some long pickup times. What is your rating? May start going in your direction and see traffic and pull ripcord? Yeah probably just the pickup times. I'm just north of you and have a lot of pickups that are 12-17 mins out. I'll take them if it's a slow day, but if I've been getting rides I would decline. The fact so many accepted then cancelled suggests traffic or something else in area. Lyft has less drivers in CT than Uber, as they came to the state, left, and came back.  As a driver, Uber keeps me busy enough here that I never bothered signing up to drive Lyft.  I've heard from those who drive for both that because Lyft has fewer drivers and riders, drivers have to drive further to each pick-up.  Some drivers will cancel the Lyft ride when a closer Uber ride comes in.  That may be what you're seeing in the illustration.  And now that Lyft is dropping what they pay drivers to well below the IRS rate of $0.58/mile in some states, I feel antipathy for Lyft to the point that I wouldn't drive for them even if I had previously.  Bottom line, outside of CT's major cities, you're better off choosing Uber than Lyft. I'm in Miami and started getting this sort of response when I would request rides and it started happening with increased frequency.  I have a 5 star rating so that isn't the problem.  I just quit using Lyft and requested Uber instead and haven't had a problem since. Unfortunately they don't pay drivers to come pick you up so it is a gamble if your ride is even worth it, and now that drivers are making significantly less per mile you're going to start seeing this a lot more. 

Lift used to counter this with driver bonuses that were based on volume and acceptance rating but they're in the process of eliminating those too so we're going back to accepting the closest trip and only highly rated passengers. This is EXACTLY what happened when Lyft stopped giving drivers surge during busy times. At least with Uber, Uber gives drivers a bonus during busy times. Switch to Uber I bet ull get drivers way more reliably than u/Lyft... You’re either to far away or low rated by other drives lol 15 to 20 minutes to pick you up means about 6.00 an hour before expenses. Assuming your ride is actually worth it by being a long one not going to the middle of nowhere, you can always call your driver when they are assigned and tell them that.  Will help you next time. Omg that’s freaking great! I use to drive out the the sticks of Rhode Island, some of the pick ups were stupid long. I had to cancel rides sometimes, because I hadn’t realized what I signed up for, Schedule a pick-up in advance. Get to know your drivers in the area, let them know your pickup times and that you'll tip. This a Lyft thing over the past 4 monhs.  Happened to me, then my wife last week going to  Nashville airport at 930am.  Except we both starting receiving multiple accepts, then a few cancellations.  She has yet to request refund.  Because of the multiple accepts, drivers starting proclaiming no- show.  What a mess... Tip for a higher rating. Usually when you get declined back to back THIS many times,its because you've been low rated for not tipping or not having a worth it enough trip Don’t look like it I didn't realize Lyft was showing passengers the model year of the car. I wonder if drivers with older cars get cancelled a lot just for that reason. Drive yourself you stupid fuck"
Destination mode issues - can only use once even though there should be six uses?,3,5.24732514075383,Lyft,"\[SO FLA MARKET) I think they are dicking with destination mode now? Last couple of weeks I notice that while I still have '6 uses' , I notice now after I use the first one, a 2nd attempt takes me to a map with no interface and nothing to click and when I 'back up' in the interface it takes me to the logged out position. 

&#x200B;

Bottom line it appears I have been restricted on destination mode. anyone else getting this?","be sure your app is updated, they made changes to the destination mode, removed 6 uses, making it 2, requiring that you choose an ""Arrive by"" time, and if at any point you go offline while your destination is set (Regardless of if you received any rides or not) it consumes the use.

In both the Lyft and Uber app, if you report you've returned an item, it's automatically charges them 15 bucks. Frankly, Lyft support is stupid. The customer probably just casually mentioned somewhere (not complaining) that they paid you cash and Lyft support did a stupid. Or maybe they complained about the $15 fee since they paid far more than that in cash (which they have a point about) and rather than refund the fee (because that would cost them money) they went after you. Indeed lyft support use to be some what smart before they contracted to overseas for their  call center now all you get are dummies who cant read! I did not go in app and say I returned Item I casually wrote back to the email saying yes Item was found and returned  and they are like ok we bonused  you 15$. Which I had no clue they would!’ The poor ride probably got charged 100$ that day with  the cash he gave me I honestly wasn’t expecting him to give me 50$ but he was so happy He got his phone back that same night and it was far drive 35 min ! I left my sunglasses in the car one time and immediately realized it. I even ran up behind the drivers car and tapped the door and he took off into traffic. I called and he said he had a ride waiting which was bullshit. He told me to go into that app to tell them and I was told I had to pay a 20$ return fee that the driver got to keep"
Lyft showing prime time again?,5,5.388089029653757,Lyft,"So I was driving tonight and I noticed a fare pop up and it showed the usual information except it also stated 24% Prime time with the fare. Ironically it did this after I explained to my last passenger that Lyft no longer pays us surge but still charges them it. 

So I wonder if this is something Lyft is finally giving back to us.",Gonna take more than 24% to get my attention but I'd welcome prime time again. Happened to me yesterday too. When I saw that message I was so shocked that even missed the request by just staring at it 🤣 I've earned $2.50 from prime time rides in the last 3 weeks. I'm rolling in the dough!
Lyft is dying at bar close,9,5.395959400024127,Lyft,I live in one of the largest metro areas in the country and Lyft is losing drivers left and right because they took away primetime and cut our pay too much.

Lyft passengers can either wait or use Uber.,"Sucks to suck Lyft, I personally only drive Uber during those times for this exact reason. lyft in my market (SO FLA) seems to have collapsed into shared rides in the working class and crappier neighborhoods during prime time commute. 

on the beaches or in the entertainment districts it's 90% Uber. 

To be fair, MIami is a city that pulls people from all over the world and they KNOW Uber, they are in 100 countries or so? THey have the app preinstalled when they roll in off the plane or cruise ship. Eh it was pretty busy with drivers in my area. May I ask which city you drive in?

Chicago: Is there more demand for Lyft Lux or Lyft XL? please advise!,1,5.637764955590721,Lyft,"Which is there more demand for in Chicago -- Lyft Lux or the regular Lyft XL--that is the one where you don't need a newer SUV or have it be an expensive luxury vehicle). I am not interested in Lux Black XL (I can't afford a 40K+ truck) so I'm curious about the demand for regular Lyft XL. 

I can afford to get a luxury sedan around 20K or an older 2010 Chevy Tahoe for around the same price. The luxury sedan would allow me to drive for Lyft Lux whereas the 2012 Tahoe would allow me to drive for Lyft XL. 

I need a car anyway and I'm not going in debt specifically to drive for Lyft--I had already budgeted and have the money and  buying a vehicle due to a recent move into the south suburbs. I may do Lyft as a side gig for 30 hours a week so I am wondering if the Chicago market has more demand for the regular non-luxury Lyft XL service or is there more demand for Lyft Lux? Any input or insight as to what car to get would be really appreciated by anyone who has some knowledge about the Chicago Lyft market. Based on your experience and knowledge, would you want to drive  the luxury sedan that would let you be able to drive for Lyft Lux or the 2010 Chevy Tahoe so you could drive for Lyft XL? Your advice would mean a lot--thank you!",Anyone driving LUX Lyft with a luxury sedan downtown? Would be interested to know of the demand. Anyone know? thanks
Drivers need to stop letting passengers get away with illegal crap.,27,5.699512640786943,Lyft,"I have had to battle more and more passengers in regards to wearing their seatbelts.  I get it. It sucks. We live in a state (California) where seatbelts are required by law. For everyone in the car.  For whatever reason this seems to mystify passengers, who have either outright refused or complained so much about it... ""I've never had to wear it before!!"" nonsense.  

I went through a DUI check point with passengers and one of them didn't have their seatbelt on and I was nearly ticketed.  Luckily the cop was cool about it, just gave me a warning. The same customers will demand you speed to make up for the lost time of them having to wait for their lyft etc..

The one that gets me though is the passengers that want to be picked up on the corner of a busy intersection or on a stretch of road where in order for you to pick them up you have to stop in the middle of the road. All of which can get you ticketed.  I've started driving down the road to a legal parking spot and making them walk.  I feel part of the problem is that enough drivers let them get away with these things. It's not their ticket so it's not like the passenger is going to care if you get cited.","If they're over 16 in California they get the ticket, not you.

https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/pubs/hdbk/seatbelts Its not necessarily about letting them get away with it. Sometimes you just have no way of knowing their seatbelt is on, they have an alcoholic beverage, they are doing drugs or high, etc. 

Sure you can refuse someone for not having a carseat, or for any other Lyft TOS but the bottom line is some folks are desperate,  dont know the law, or simply dont want to risk  a bad rating or spend 15 minutes on the phone talking to support. One of my first pax I ever bc picked up, I picked up this guy and his girlfriend from the airport and they had a bunch of stuff w them from their trip. The guy put the wrong address into the app and blamed me for not knowing where he was supposed to go 🙄but then he got attitude and pulled out a cup of soda and taking shots from a flask with god knows what. I asked him if he could not have that in my car and he refused to put it away. I told them if they didn’t put it away, I’d ask them to exit the vehicle wherever I was. He said he would report me and call the cops for having alcohol present in my car. I just ended up taking them to their location, but I seriously got so strict with my pax after him because I was not about to get my car impounded or anything because this guy thinks he’s above the law. Alternate stomping the gas and brake, bounce their head off the windshield multiple times. Make a headbanging at a Slayer concert look like preschool.

If they still refuse to put on a seatbelt, cancel the ride and send them on their way to find another driver. Agree with all of this. I just had a girl do coke off another girl's tit in my car. I'm fine with it. I had a young lady wanted me to park in a handicap space because it was closer to her and she didn't want to get wet. It was barely drizzling. It's all about the shity drivers people that should never even been behind the wheel who now suddenly drive in Hollywood and other places where they're incompetent to handle it. 
the Prius drivers just stop outright & sideways in the middle of the street. sometimes even in the fast lane. we sometimes can't even drive down Sunset, but the seatbelt thing I could care less about. 
What matters to me is how often they break out mirrors & start doing coke, hide booze in their jackets start drinking, and other stuff you can't mention online.. That's what matters to me, stuff where it affects me or grosses me out makes me have my car at risk of getting impounded. But it's all because of the other drivers. 
Last night there was a guy driving around with a sign that said ""I'm an Uber driver, (or) for $20, I'll take you anywhere up to 6 Mi"".. got a giant sign I mean. 
Uber does no quality control checks, how hard is it to get rid of that guy? it's either fake taxi or it's a fake Uber driver. 
I see this stuff Non-Stop and then we can get into all the driver's selling stuff to the passengers. Uber and Lyft are libertarian corporations."

Until our society views rideshare as a ""worthy"" service for tips, this will continue. Is this a platform issue?  Does Uber riders tip more? This is starting to get absolutely rediculous. People are so cheap I just don't understand it. Not to mention 5 of these rides were under a mile, each one took about 5 mins.

The only time you actually get an out of queue ping while at the staging lot is briefly the moment you sign in, as if the app doesnt understand you are in the staging lot just yet. After a few declines you stop getting them. The only downside with lyft is if you decline an airport ride (bad rating for example) you get dropped to the bottom of the queue, or at least a good 10-15 spots behind. At least with uber you can decline up to 3 airport rides if they all have bad scores before accepting a decent one."

Anyway the moment you grab a paper towel you just started your own cleaning business. Call it ""lyddss bubbles and suds, you spill it we clean it!"" and charge accordingly.

How often do you talk to (other) passengers?,8,6.578297363042279,Lyft,"Do you like being engaged in conversations with (other) passengers?

Why/ Why not?","I used to but now I just say hey, (their name)? 
>yes, and you’re (my name)?<

>alright, we’re on our way<

After that I’ll ask if they’re doing ok and based on their response, 

* “I’m doing ok, etc.. usually they want to keep talking

* “Fine” means they’re not in a talkative mood

Then I’ll just play my music and not a word is said till I drop them off and give them a big “have a good one! Stay safe. 

Don’t drive much anymore but I’ve never been below 5 stars. (I know nothing to be proud of). I think most people prefer a quiet ride. I only talk when the passenger engages in conversation first. With the quiet rides, I just make sure I'm coming across as friendly and customer service oriented. I don’t know if the OP means shared lyfts or pax. 

I chat people up for two reasons. Some people tip unless given a reason not to. Most others won’t tip unless given a reason to. I like getting paid more to enjoy my time more. People tip those that take an interest in them and make their experience more enjoyable. 

My favorite is making fun of other cars/drivers/pedestrians/billboard with the passengers. We’ve laughed ourselves into tears 😭. The pax' lyft app could do the heavy lifting here by prompting the pax with trivia questions throughout the ride,

2 cent discount for every correct answer. standard public transportation rules apply. If passengers talk i talk otherwise i'd rather listen my music . Usually women don't talk. Because I'm not in a bar i don't talk to them either. I take the temperature of the ride and respond accordingly. I also check if they're on their phone. I've lost a lot of my hearing so I'm talking less. At first. Now silence is golden"
Theft by an Uber driver--has it happened to you? What do you do?,12,6.591433937130151,Lyft,"  

I’m curious to know if anyone has had their luggage stolen by a ridesharing driver. This recently happened to a friend on a trip to Phoenix, AZ. It was the first time I heard about this type of theft. After sharing this link with him--[https://fymhotsauce.rocks/blogs/news/my-uber-driver-robbed-me-so-i-took-uber-to-court-and-won](https://fymhotsauce.rocks/blogs/news/my-uber-driver-robbed-me-so-i-took-uber-to-court-and-won)\--my friend told me this was similar to his experience with the driver immediately leaving with the luggage in the trunk after he exited the car. After contacting Uber, he was told that because the drivers were independent contractors, they were not liable for any losses and that he, the passenger, had to work it out with the driver. The driver never responded to any calls or voice messages, and the luggage has not been recovered. He filed a police report including the driver’s name, license plate, and car model. The author on the linked article investigated, filed a complaint in small claims court, and eventually won his court case.  I’m wondering what the statistics for occurrence and outcome for others have been.

· If your luggage was stolen, what action did you take? 

· Were you able to get your luggage and the contents back?

· If successful in obtaining your luggage, how did you accomplish this? How long did it take?

· If you couldn’t take action or obstacles were encountered, why or what occurred?

· What do you recommend to reduce this happening to you again or to others?","“Recently happened” it’s a blog post from 2017 about something that happened in 2016. So not all that recent. Interesting read though. Damn this just made me think of how messed up it would be to drop someone at the airport and take off before they can open the trunk. 🤯 In the article you linked it's very possible one of the following riders took the bag. Drivers often drop someone off and rush to pick the next person up around the corner. Riders are the same as drivers when it comes to being dishonest. I have seen riders steal my other riders property first hand.

When I used to drive I had a couple of instances where riders contacted me asking about items they may have left in the car which I couldnt find. Either they thought they left it in my car or one of the riders afterwards thought it was a nice scarf or pair of glasses.

These situations may sounds unlike yours however, although the luggage was in the trunk, if he picked someone else up at the airport it's possible they put their luggage in along with it when getting in then snagged it at the drop off. I caught a rider also attempting this with my own property once.

I hope for your sake that this happened today and that the luggage is still in his trunk without realizing it till he sees his missed calls/texts when he wake up in the morning. Why did the check come from Uber? I'm curious since they claim zero responsibility for anything. Easy solution to reduce occurrences like that is to keep your luggage with you.

Other note, if your friend encountered a driver who did something like that, chances are extremely high that it was a low rated driver. If your friend got matched up with said driver, that makes it a really good chance that your friend also has a low rating, which will cause him to be matched up with low rated drivers, which will results in successive poor experiences.

There's no way for passengers to see their rating. All you can do is ask a driver if they noticed it when they got their ping. Your friend might be a frequent Drinker and maybe messed up some drivers cars, or perhaps they did the old ""I'll tip you in the app"" routine, and were giving a 1 by their driver. If they do this frequently, their rating could be as low as 4.6 to 4.7, which will get you matched up with some pretty shitty drivers.

The absolute best way to prevent terrible occurrences like this is to keep your rating at 4.9 to 5.0, which will keep you matched up with high rated drivers more often than not. This is just a rule of thumb by the way, as if you are in a busy area where demand is high and Supply is low, you could get matched up with low rated drivers just because that was the quickest pick up for you buy a significant factor.

Also, of course, you can always cancel the trip request should you get paired up with a driver that has a rating below 4.9; you have to be a really shitty Driver to get your rating below 4.9.   I recommend this anyhow, as it will funnel more rides to respectable and dependable drivers , and keep the shitty drivers on the side of the road where they belong."
Cancelled rides,3,6.676700140833855,Lyft,Whatever happened to me being an independent contractor?  Isn't it up to me as a contractor to decide if I want to take a ride request or not?  According to Lyft it isn't.  They're telling me I've been cancelling or missing (pressing the x) too many rides lately and that my account has been flagged.  Anyone know what I can do about this?  Didn't Lyft just recently lose a lawsuit about this?,"Lyft is overly annoying with their childish pop up messages.

But on the flip side, if I hired you as an independent contractor and you kept cancelling on clients, I would terminate your contract pretty fast. If you're canceling rides that's why. If you don't wanna give rides then don't accept. But yes canceling rides can get you Deactivated."

One was $295 for 35 rides and another was $120 for 15 rides. I debated the $120 one but couldn’t bring myself to give them the satisfaction. I haven’t another offer since. haha, horrible.  I'd destroy that min. in probably like 20 rides. I like how you fuck with them. Kudos!

How I read this: it's not a bonus on top of what you book but rather the amount you will gross. I wouldn't be salivating over a guarentee😂 They're pointless and worthless. You'll make the guarentee amount in half the required rides in most cases. Always ignore guarentees, always! I'm so mad. I havent been offered any deals like this in so long lol. I used to get them weekly then they randomly stopped. No matter if I do 4 trips or 50. I'm not getting any bonus chances. I once drove over 70 each week and nothing. Pretty sad tbh. I would do the 80-100 trip ones if it's possible. They did that shit to me too. If you give 34 rides and have not broke $250. Go work at fed ex or amazon. ....completes 37 rides and makes $350..... Yep, anything less than $10 a ride is total shit. Oh man, as a once driver I love Lyft and hate Lyft. It's a great alternative to taxi cabs, but it has gone downhill fast for drivers. With pdb it used to be profitable, now all I see is mediocre earnings while still having to pay for gas, maintenance, etc. I tip when I can, except on $15 rides to go 1.5 miles ($30 is probably the biggest expense for me going out because ya know, pregame) but it seems drivers are even making less than 50% of that money now while Lyft takes the rest. I don't know how drivers keep doing it. It's sad that it almost relies on tipping drivers now for them to make any kind of decent profit."

Most people are cool and fun to talk to. I like helping people get where they need to go. I spend too much on dinner every day. When Lyft became an app that openly has driven wages down for people in my community, Lyft stopped receiving positive praise from me.  I've never heard of a job where year over year your pay decreases...yell gig/ parttime all you want, but the reality is - drivers are on the road & a fundamental part of the Lyft app and it's bonus system attempts to keep them on the road longer & longer to lower & lower pay & still attempt to yell ""parttime gig""... I like Lyft more as a customer because the driver's seem much more personable than Uber. 

I always use them from airport to home and home to airport. 

Never had a driver cancel on me for a scheduled pick up like I did with Uber. 

Also since my flights are early morning and I have them pick me up at 330am I buy them a red bull (long as we stop at 7-11) and give them a 5 dollar tip. 

Never had an instance where I didn't want to give them 5 stars. I make decent money using them via multiapping Best trip ever was taking a mom and daughter to Disneyland for the first time to hear a six year old so excited to see princesses made my day. It's better than working at Walmart. 

I mean, if ALL you care about is money and literally nothing else, I guess this gig is the worst thing imaginable. For me though, being able to set my own schedule and not have someone micro-managing me for nine hours a day is worth the headaches. The money...big tippers...freedom. Its great for me. I Occasionally drive on a friday or Saturday night and make decent $. Good experiences so far. Good side hussle Like this has to be a bot or an Astroturf?

Why Did Lyft Take Surges Away?,14,7.999825140880765,Lyft,"The only reason I worked late at night was for surges, now I realize they’ve completely trashed surges for drivers. I tested this out by opening the passenger app during a football game traffic rush in my college town, and saw Lyft was charging people $70-90 for a 5 mile ride. I open my driver app and just see orange and yellow zones, no surges to be found.

Thank god I just got approved for Uber because at least they offer some surge pricing. I dont know how Lyft gets away with this now...","Dude how long you been driving for lyft? They changed the map like 3 months ago. They didn't take away surge in your area they just changed the heat map to show you were it's busy. Two years, I took a break over summer. If i get a ride in the orange/yellow area do I get a surge price? I liked it better when it was just “25-150%” surge areas. Lyft gets away with it because their trash drivers keep bending over."
Is the Lyft (driver) app rubbish for anyone else?,4,8.027880696447358,Lyft,"Literally every other action is getting stuck in an error loop, forcing me to reset my phone to get it responding again. Like literally every other button press gets caught in this loop. I tried contacting Lyft support about it and they just sent me an email telling me to try resetting my phone.  >_>  So there's clearly no avenue for finding fixes there.

Also, when I try sending the ""I have arrived"" notice, I usually get that warning that I'm not close enough despite being right at ther pin, and choosing to send it anyway has never in the history of ever worked. And the app is constantly giving me that ""poor network connection"" warning though my network is strong. Like I said, complete rubbish. 

Are any other drivers dealing with this? What about riders, anyone having issues with stuff on their end? Curious if it's maybe specific to my phone (Samsung s10+) or network (t-mobile).","Its probably your network, this sounds like typical network issues."
A Lyft Pax Phone call....,50,8.0314339371881,Lyft,"So I picked up a young guy, probably about 16-18ish? Well I greeted him nicely and only got a rude look and a ""you gon pull off or what?"" As I put it in gear. Then you call your ""girl"" and it goes like this....

""SO you was actually in his house?"" 

""You get them pictures like I told you?""

""Oh good shit, your sure he ain't gone be there? I dont want to have to shoot a nigga."" 

Some silence for a moment...


""So all his money in that dresser? What about his playstation? Just give me all the pics of shit that's worth something""

""Well what time he leavin? Your still gone go out to the movie with him? Cool just text me when y'all leave I'm headed that way in the uber just make sure y'all dont come back early I ain't tryna catch a body.'

He then tells me that I ""took long enough"" to get him there.

So after all this I give him a 1 star and also called the Pittsburgh Police Department, to explain how a teenager just planned a robbery in my backseat, they said they would watch out for any reported robberies and appriceated the tip. Also reported him to Lyft their response: ""We apologize for the inconvenience, we will make sure you dont mat h with this passenger again. For future reference, you just have to rate someone below 3 stars and you automatically will not match again.""

^^^This is the same response Lyft gave when I was almost arrested for being involved in a drug deal when 2 junkies had me take them to a swap legitimately 25ft from a police checkpoint and still did the deal as the police watched.","This is the exact reason we have cameras that dude most likely got robbed [deleted] Criminal mastermind right there Dont really see a risk driving someone who appears to be about 18. Lol also if I asked everyone who could have been under 18 for their ID I'd never have a ride. My dashcam is all the evidence I'd ever need if someone tried to say I did something to them :) You gave a tip but didnt get one lol Not 18?  No ride. Lmao Lol the legal liability is what? That they may claim I touched them or tried to kidnap them? Well I can assure you I dont have any issues making sure I dont molest children and that I dont make a habit of stealing one. So those types of law suits should never arise... Lest if someone did lie, I would have full recording of the street and me driving...would be kind of easy to have the case dismissed....nothing illegal is transpiring. I agree you should take the stick out of your ass and sit down :) No you're not a doorman your business owner who's not supposed to have minors in your car! man everybody here is being cautious and even mentioning some of the other risks, do you not get the different implications of an adult male driving an underage kid with no one around and your camera is only going to show so much, it's not going to be the same as if you just disassociated and weren't in the vehicle at all or around the vehicle, and do you not have the logic to realize something could go wrong in the Ride like the directions, now you're in the middle of nowhere with an underage minor and at what the appearance is for doing that, do you not get that there's no reason to want an underage minor? 
are you expecting a big tip from like a fifteen-year-old girl or guy? On top of that geez what kind of person do you get that's a minor? quite often even worse than adult passengers , there buzzed they're immature they have no consequences for whatever they do to your car cuz they're minors, and they plan robberies Worse case scenario the cops pull up and tell them what you told him YOU heard in YOUR car..he comes to get you...then what ? Lol. I would not have called the cops about that. That was none of your business to be ready to tell. For all you know he could have been bullshitting lol"
I think this is fraud,8,8.114373752013952,Lyft,Image,"1. Never do shared 
2. You went like a mile. 
3. See 1 To be clear, this was almost a 20 minute ride. It says it right in the image. It was 11 miles. Not 1.4. They gave me the original shared price and didn't even adjust for time. Just look at the image - what they paid me for vs actual time. It was a slow night. Drove 15 minutes to pick up older gentleman. Start driving and he says that the address is incorrect. Pull over and he shows me his app and it has a restaurant listed as destination. I exit and open app and nothing. Then my app starts having connection issues. I use GPS to drive him 15 minutes to destination. I get connection after he exits and I end ride and believe I can edit drop-off. Nope. And I get minimum rate. I check ride info and it says I dropped him off at original incorrect destination and ride was 5 minutes. Except none of the actual information reflects that. Lyft support said that shared rides are pre determined rates. I guess that means right down to time and distance... Take them to small claims court"
Probably the last straw for me (driver),18,8.226688566828768,Lyft,"I was trying to get a streak this morning. I signed on in time. My first ride request pings right before 7:15 when it ends. This passenger cancels and in less than the time it took to pump my gas I have a new one. This request must have come in after 7:15.

Well, my new passenger is going 35 miles which I only find out after I have arrived for the passenger (who is on the street already waiting). Now of course I don't get a notification for this on the ping because it's very light traffic and it's not a 45 minute or longer ride. I completed the ride; she was actually very nice and in no way is this her fault.

After completing the 34.27 miles in a whopping 38 minutes and 17 seconds I'm rewarded with not only a measly $26.23 but I also find out that my streak has been cancelled for no good reason. 

I am sick of these bad business practices. The rates are far too low; I'm not even sure this ride was financially proffitable to me. The PPZ is an absolute joke. Furthermore, there's not a shred of support, so it's not like I could even call anyone to get this resolved (not that they would even be able to).

Tl;Dr Lyft sucks. I'm gonna start looking for another job because this is not financially viable even to someone who owns a car that is completely paid for.","$26.23 for a 40 minute ride isnt terrible. if we got paid more per minute itd be better. Yeah, Lyft is terrible. By some crazy coincidence I had 2 near identical trips back to back - one Lyft, one Uber. To my surprise Uber paid nearly 50% more - 11$ from Lyft to uber's $18. I was shocked. I always thought Lyft gave more to drivers. I used to only drive for Lyft, now I only drive for uber. Feel you bro.

Sorry to hear about this.  

Lot of good people and workers who are being pushed out of these gigs due to poor treatment.  

At some point theyll figure it out.  By that time it will probably  be too late for them and their company. You didn't complete a ride accepted before 7:15. Don't wait until the end of the window. You go girl!"
This why shared rides are a scam this is for anyone who hasn't seen this yet.,7,8.24365615942136,Lyft,Image,"Shared rides are gold for Lyft. Fools gold for drivers. Wheres the scam? STOP TAKING LYFT RIDES, STOP TAKING SHARED RIDES. THEY CANT SHOVE THE BROOMSTICK IF YOU STOP BENDING OVER."
Express Drive / Donlen Maintenance,5,8.476063566842564,Lyft,"  
I recently picked up a Hertz Express Drive car, which I plan to return in about 3 weeks. Since yesterday I've been getting emails and texts from Donlen Maintenance saying that the car needs to be serviced.    


I just don't want to waste time dealing with it, considering I just got the car last week and figured it would have been properly serviced when they gave it to me.   


Can I ignore those, or would that cause problems when  I return the car to Hertz?","Never assume the car has been serviced before you pick it up. They suck. 

The email also says you can ignore it if the car has already been serviced recently. Both the Hertz manager and Pep Boys service manager at my location said to just completely ignore those notifications when I asked about it. Sucks because I would love for them to do everything listed in the email, but oh well. I see if there's a next oil change sticker on the windshield.

They are not going to do anything if you are late by a 1,000 or two. But somewhere in the doc they warn you that you have to take it to maintenance one way or the other.

I can be a quick oil change if you make an appointment with a not busy Pepboys. It needs some explanation if they never do Dolen before. Otherwise, it's an immediate quick oil change at 11:00 am. I asked for a tire rotation but they give me readings that all tires are evenly wore.

Another Pepboys, another car, they told me 3 hours. I didn't take it up.

Another Pepboys, it wasn't long but I got so many readings on the bill like a certificated pre-own car for sale. So I think Dolen do keep records. Or the Boys just do what they want. They gave you a slip with the mileage to get it serviced at. If not call and ask Hertz for that mileage. I’ve gotten these as well but just ignore them as I know when the car needs maintenance and have had it for a few cycles now. Go swap it out with Hertz."
New,8,8.629477918694418,Lyft,I literally just started last night. Is there anything I should know?,"When you get a ping you will drive to the pickup point at your own expense. Think of that whenever you look at how far from you the rider is located. Equally as important, ensure you have rideshare insurance so you're covered from the time you get the ping to when you pick up the pax. Uber insurance begins when you start the ride. Read this forum every night to enjoy the benefit of more experienced drivers. You seem to know that already. never accept rides over 12 minutes away.  
never accept rides with a score under 4.7. Save every reciept and file them at the end of the night. Record every mile driven to a pax and with a pax. KNOW your rate card! Some of us get paid on the way to the pax,some of us don't If you only own one car and you are driving lyft in it , just stop while you’re ahead"
"Boss got me and co-worker a Lyft to a town 2.5 hours away, driver had no idea it was that far of a trip.",13,8.647232548332324,Lyft,"He was pretty peeved when he found out how far he would be driving. And then all the way back, probably to get stuck in traffic. 

Isn’t there a feature to set your distance limitations?","Either make it a scheduled ride so the driver can see the destination and/or call immediately after being assigned a driver to let them know. I wouldn't take the ride, and would let the passenger know I'm going to cancel it.

Here in Phoenix, we have the new/lower pay rates. I had a ride that went to Prescott (2 hrs/108 mi) away. I was paid a whole $1.98 without passenger, and a total of $57.73. T was hoping for a pickup along the way back to town, but didn't get anything. So, 4 hours for $57.73. I would usually do better than that staying local. That will be the last long trip I do for Lyft. No.  There is not.  At least, not normally.

Drivers have few options to do that.  Honestly, I would’ve pulled up to you, then told you I’m not doing that drive.  2.5 hours one way is really 5 hours round-trip.  With the “gig” economy, rideshare drivers / delivery drivers only get paid when they’re on a trip.  There is no way to guarantee a ride back toward the driver’s residence.  Basically, they don’t get paid for the time/mileage that they drive back.

Rideshare is only good within the the city and its suburbs, otherwise you’re screwing the driver.  Tell your boss... thanks, asshat.  Better yet, let me leave him/her a shitty e-mail to bring them down to earth. With a ride like that what should be done is a two stop ride one to drop you off and then allow the driver to return to their city while being paid for that leg as well. I'm sure he earned more in that one trip than he would have in that same amount of time.  I'd be thrilled with that trip, especially because I know I'd get at least one ride back. Unfortunately, neither app puts a specifier one time or distance. Sometimes I drive until I have something planned and don’t want to go too far out of the city. 2.5 hour trip? how many miles?  
tell your boss to schedule a trip like that in eastern orlando. i'll take that. figure $12 for time (2.5 hours),  $70 for the mileage,130 miles? even after lyft takes out probably $30 Driver could have cancelled upon arrival and information. Did you tip in cash? The driver made the choice. I turned down many of those myself but also accepted a few. Not your problem just let them know in advance if you can. Sometimes I'll give rides from Omaha to Lincoln or Omaha to Des Moines (both over an hour away), even though I know for sure there is no way I'll get a ride back. 4 out of 5 times, there are a few minutes of chitchat, then the passenger naps or chills on their phone while I get to listen to podcasts and cruise for a couple hours. Even if it's not entirely worth it financially (I made about $60 on the last trip to Lincoln, equating to about $30 an hour and a lot of miles on the car), I still appreciate the occasional diversion."
"Anyone else had this ""processing"" thing happen before? What's the deal?",3,8.688517270554547,Lyft,Image,"I don't know if it's triggered by suspicious activity or just a regular audit of rides but it's normal. Update: ended up getting paid for the ride, but I'm curious as to how this happens"
If you wouldn't leave a $0 tip for your waiter why would you do that to your rideshare driver?,12,8.738401529813807,Lyft,,"I'm of the opinion that some people don't see rideshare as a tip-worthy service. They are just getting a ride somewhere. They don't have a lot of control over the experience like they do with eating out. That may be one of the reasons why some people don't tip like they do wait staff. I found that less than 10% of my lyft rides actually tip compared to around 30% of my Uber rides.  Where I drive, Lyft and Uber have a totally different class of riders which might explain it. get used to it. 3000 trips ive done it averages 10-15% of riders tip. even with a 5 star rating. When you eat out, you pay for the food, but not really for the service.  So you tip to pay for the service.

When you get delivery from an in house delivery person, you get a charge, but only a little one, so you tip to make up the difference.

Really you should compare it to a cab where you pay the fare, and tip.  

I do think it was better when there was no way to tip in the app and no expectation of a cash tip.  Just less ambiguous all around. It is more common in certain areas.  I agree though, about 10% of my riders tip in the area I drive in. I find larger metropolitan areas people are more likely to tip.  I also have a feeling from conversations with customers that a lot of them have had, what they feel as, negative experience with cancelled rides, or Lyft and use that as an excuse to not tip.  Either it's an unwillingness or inability to separate independent drivers from lyft or other drivers or just a convenient excuse. Not sure which.  I've even had conversations with waiters and bartenders that will bemoan a bad tipper at work and then not tip their driver.  One might say do more for them and earn the tip.  I've helped people take groceries inside, haul junk in my car to a recycling center and then help unload it etc.. and about the same % of tips. I’ve started just 1 starring the non tippers. This again... Imma save you some time while this thread spirals out of control. It's because the cheapskates who don't tip have plenty of reasons to justify their shitty rider ediquite, and they just don't give a fuck. In the US, it should be customary to tip a rideshare driver, just like a limo driver or taxi. If you disagree, then you're wrong and you shouldn't be hiring cars. Take the bus or a train, no one is expected to tip a public transportation driver. because MANY of the riders are simply CHEAP HITCHHIKERS!"
Lyft Seems To Be Charging Me A Cancellation Fee On A Ride I actually Took? Does Anyone Know What Is Going On Here? I Emailed Support - We All Know How Useless That Can Be. Even If You're A Customer.,4,8.742186252047066,Lyft,Image,"I’m a driver myself.  All I can guess is that you cancelled on the 1st driver and it automatically dispatched another that completed your ride.  Or possible the driver cancelled for a no show and it sent a second driver. What are we looking at?

What's in your Ride History in the app? Your cancel fee has a unique address. Everything looks legit."
"Ah, don’t you just love some pax?",47,8.825658474269288,Lyft,Image,"This is why I would never ride share where I live.  people are way too trashy Had a businessman from out of state literally steal my charging cable. He was wearing pretty nice suit, but I guess he forgot his charger back at home. his time must be much more valuable than my belongings.

I had another guy literally take a chewed piece of peppermint hard candy out of his mouth and put it in my cup holder. Front seat, not even an attempt to be sneaky. He didn't care that I saw.

Yet another guy gets in the front seat and immediately goes, well let me fix this. Starts messing with all my console controls, I mean, all. I look at his destination and realize he's going about 5 minutes down the road. I asked him to please exit the vehicle. His girlfriend was pissed. Please start posting your hate mail Dude. I had a pax the other day get pissed because I wouldn’t let him keep my aux cord. People are fucking stupid. I'm gonna start posting my hate mail on this sub. If you want some solid gold reading take a look at this thread from the DC UP.net board. 


https://uberpeople.net/threads/love-letters-to-pax.200912/page-75

Enjoy..... Well I had the strangest pax Sunday morning. Upon entering the vehicle, he informs me that I will be hearing some strange noises coming from him during the ride. WTF? Tells me he needs to warm up for the singing engagement at a church, Okay? Imagine a little kid making ""motor boat"" noises with his flappy lips . This lasted non stop for 10 minutes. Then he removes his headphones and informs me he will be making a different noise. Okay? He switches to mouth trumpet noises non stop for the duration of the drive , about 10 more minutes. BTW, quite loud and very strange. Upon exiting he informs me most drivers get pissed when he performs this ritual. 

This response had nothing to do with your post, but I feel for you. There is weird and there is strange and there is just obnoxious. We get them. Perfect example of why we're not independent contractors if this happened in say a taxi we would absolutely be able to charge the customer for damages incurred i have to start posting my hate mail...lol"
Lyft driver going 80 on a 55 subdued on side of road and arrested.,4,8.8562950483544,Lyft,Image,Play stupid games... amirite? lol nice ooof. We had an Uber driver do this yesterday.. I was praying a cop was near by but no such luck :/
What fees may I be charged?,6,8.976075140946993,Lyft,Image,Things such as a lost item. making a mess in the car damags to the car etc what are you talking about? The Lyft driver app has a section for me to add my PayPal account or a credit card and I’m wondering what for.
Lyft PPZ is a scam,29,9.10990615947931,Lyft,"Yes I know...Lyft in general is a scam BUT...I'm specifically talking about the PPZ. Caught a $10 bonus by the airport (Denver) after 30 miles without a ""next"" ride, I shut it off and on again which cleared the bonus and I barely had the slider back to purple when the next ride came in. 3 min from my location. 

Pathetic","Multiple similar experiences here. u/Lyft SCAM What is ppz Lyft loves cheating. They don't do it out of necessity. They do it out of the need to feel power and control over others. They have always been this way. It is their vice that they are not overcoming but instead allowing to bring them down. I guess they have absolutely no desire to be good honest people. They're angry stupid losers that want to inflict misery on others. I'm confident that the at least one of the founders is a full fledged psychopath. They will get what they deserve. Do not fear.

This email is a service from Lyft. Delivered by Zendesk Yeah, it sucks, but it was pure coincidence, nothing more. Before the “yOu’Re A sHiLl!” comments come, lemme explain:

You had a $10 bonus. You’re probably thinking that Lyft was skipping you because they didn’t want to pay that extra $10, right? Obviously something was going on near that PPZ area, right? PPZ isn’t across the board, meaning every driver supposedly sees something different. Some get it, others see $1, and others still see nothing. The paxs, on the other hand, every single one is getting surge pricing. 

TL;DR - Lyft isn’t worried about your $10 while they collect $1,000s from surge pricing *not* being paid to other drivers. So you turned on the passenger too to see if lyft cars next to you were disappearing off the screen? If so you might have a point of concern. If not ...... Since PPZs were implemented here in Rapid City, SD passenger rates have been higher but we don't get the benefit. I drive Lyft and Uber and have been telling my Lyft PAX to use Uber next time. Yeah you would think since it’s customized just for you it would always be there, but the few times I driven for them since they implemented this bs I notice that it would disappear if I logged in and out especially if their crappy app bugged out which it did often. Interesting stuff that may be related...

Generally there should be a ton of rides available in downtown San Francisco at all hours. But for the last couple days, my rides has to come from 10 to 15 minutes away. Heres how ive handled it at times. If i get a decent ppz bonus on next ride ill normally turn uber off and give it about 5 minutes. If no trips then ill turn on uber and accept next trip that comes. If its uber i wont turn off lyft and ill do the uber pick up. If i finally get the lyft ppz trip ill accept it even if im still on the uber trip. If the rider cancels ill often get that fee , if not ill finish the  uber trip and then go to the lyft trip. Most times never have an issue with the lyft pax questioning it.  If they do mention the route i just say i was completing a trip....if they want to be pissed or give attitude, ok trip canceled. Order another driver. Wait. Why did you shut it off? I may be wrong here as I only drive lyft 10% vs. Uber 90% but my understanding is that you have to keep the app open for the next ride bonus to apply. By turning it off the bonus was cancelled. I have always received my bonus before shutting the app closed. How is this a scam? You went offline and lost the bonus."
What’s the average wait time for background checks,8,9.520091344664495,Lyft,Image,"It usually takes 24-72 hours. However, if you didn't give your consent or if any information (like your name or document) does not match it can take months Mine took about two weeks... Mine was under 24 hours (MA). You can go on [Checkr](https://candidate.checkr.com/) to see what your status is and make sure there isn't any missing information.  Both Lyft and Uber use their service for background checks. there's no real answer unfortunately 2 days to a month can be the time frame. Unfortunately mine took 7 weeks. mine was a week and i've got a clean background. If your lucky, forever."
Background check question,4,9.65590152984968,Lyft,I got a felony assault conviction 13 years ago. Do you think I have a chance to pass the background check?,"id apply anyway,  worse they can say is no. Honestly recommend getting a real job though,  Lyft pays crap for the stress you go through. A felony assault conviction should actually be a requirement for dealing with Lyft Passengers. Nope Are you eligible to have it expunged?"
Why does the app always register my address in an alley??,7,9.709142270601458,Lyft,I can't change this no matter how many times I re enter my address. I live in a major US city. The alley is only used for trash. Its more difficult to get to this alley than it is to my front door as you need to go down a one way street to access it from a side alley. Wtf,"Enter your address in Google Maps. It is possible that the Google Map pin is in the alley. In order to fix this. Go out and stand where you want the car to pick you up at. Enter the address in Google Maps, scroll down, and submit a correction “the address is here.”  

If you are using the GPS function of the app, make sure you are at the front of your house when you submit a request for a ride. Sometimes the app puts you at the closest road... Which it thinks is the alley. After you entered the destination, you can see two pins on the map. Tap on the pickup pin, select choose on the map near the bottom. Move the map so the pin is on your front door. Zoom with two fingers if you need to. Optionally, add note to the driver giving the name of the building or apartment if any. I've been told that Lyft's GPS uses the trash pickup maps. This is why it takes us to alleys and behind businesses. It does it to everyone. Every time. If there is an address that has an alley behind it, the app will have us pass the house to get to the alleyway. Instead, type in your address but drag the pin and drop it in front of your house for the puck up location. Feel free to text or call your driver to let them know what street to pick you up on. It’s just common sense that a PAX is probably not waiting in an alleyway. I will just look at the actual address of the pickup info and go there. 

Thing is with so many new drivers always starting they probably don’t realize and always go to the alleyway since that’s where the app sends them."
My first personal zone. Was my first ride of the day and easily my best ride of the day ended up being $3.68 bonus and a $5 tip on top. Anyone have any onsite on these personal zones?,2,9.841190881712569,Lyft,Image,[deleted] fuck ppz
How does the scheduled ride work?,6,9.886908474316199,Lyft,"I scheduled one and am waiting for a driver match. My fear is that no one will be matched. How soon do you get a driver? The ride is at 4:20am, so I’m wondering if I should just get a normal taxi to the airport.","If nobody picks up your ride, lyft will send a ping to someone that's close enough to get to you at the scheduled time Just call a ride at 3:45. Scheduled rides dont always come through. It won't tell you you have a driver until like 10-20 minutes before.  We can see that you scheduled a ride and can pick it up right when you request it though.  Not sure why Lyft does this, but that's how it works.  If you don't trust the app, I would go ahead and book a normal taxi.  It depends where you are too.  If you were to live in the Bay Area like me, it'd be easy to find a driver at that time and I wouldn't worry about it."
Why Lyfy gives me these $100 guarantees is a mystery. It isn't hard for me to reach $115 any week of the year.,45,9.933748752093978,Lyft,Image,"I use them as an excuse to convince my wife to let me go drive that night lol That's great money on a campus.. Wish I had that offer in Columbus, 15-3$ rides =150$ to be honest it takes allot of work to make any profit on these 3$ rides in a car that gets 12mpg city :/ Should be $150 guarenteed. It’s for the shit of the draw drivers who average 3-5 dollar per ride. Damn $115 for 15 rides? Easy money I think that the idea is if its below the $115 for the week they pay the difference? It's not about you. It's about getting enough drivers out on the road to make the network function smoothly. Fewer drivers means longer waits, dead zones. They're just dangling the carrot out there so plenty of people will fire up the app and go to work. What is lyfy?  this seems like a teaser pay for a while and then you start earning less $115 for 15 rides? That’s nothing! I pulled $155 in 13 rides today! Honestly to me it is an incentive to up my acceptance rate. Why bother picking-and-choosing for longer rides when I can do 10 rides in the same 3 mile area for the minimum fare and earn the same amount? Then again, I am in a pretty small market. When I was driving in la I would have loved that (coupled with Uber for after I got the guarantee). I'd just ignore anything that wasn't a line ride. Could easily do 4 to 6 an hour especially if I drove over to USC. They have shitty promos. They're more for people like me who only work weekends and sometimes don't make $100. If I'm not gun ho about working, these can be a good kick in the butt; especially in city markets where you could do 15 $3.60 fares, which is way less than $115. It’s basically anything to keep you from switching apps even if it’s not just Uber you use. I get them too 5 rides for $25 extra at 6AM. At that hour of the day I can make that in 30 minutes or less delivering doughnuts or breakfast on Eats. App jumping is the only way to guarantee your earnings. I wouldn’t dare take a chance of being on Lyft only for any amount of time. I just did two bonuses back to back. 15 rides/$135. I live outside DC area. Most people dont go far so it is a win.

Weekends at least is not great because most people will go to DC for clubbing. Each ride is almost $30. Once I'm inside DC is easy to make good money so those offers do not mean much."
3rd reminder for using Airplane Mode,6,10.001318196538422,Lyft,"I really thought I was smart but after the couple 15-20 minute pickups that resulted in a $2-$10 ride I started doing that....I called ""Lyft"" in India and they said I can be deactivated if I don't accept every single ride from now on, not understanding I am volunteering my gas and time for a $2 trip (possible 30 minute trip time from pickup to drop off)

Is there a way around this crap?","Just decline the requests rather than try to get sneaky using airplane mode. They won't deactivate you for declining too many trips. Cancellations are what you need to manage. Ignore their threats. Wait, I don’t get it. What are you doing w airplane mode that they don’t like? you also used to be able to shut off the app by swiping it until they got wise. Better just to offline until ready and just decline trips that are too far away. I also used to reboot my phone on occasion to mix things up."
The majority of you are easily the most unlikable miserable human beings I’ve ever come in contact with and then wonder why no one tips you.,82,10.531653844700367,Lyft,"This subreddit has so many bottom of the barrel people in it and it’s pretty alarming seeing the mass amount of negative, miserable fucks posting in the sub everyday. 

My favorite is someone who is happy about the night they had and excited to share it and in **every** thread there’s the same two comments:

“BuT YOu HavE To COuNt fOR GAS ANd maiNtenANcE”

And 

“THAT’S a good night for you? Yikes.”

Like, let people fucking be happy. 

The other day I picked up this businessman who told me at the end of his ride that I was the best driver he’s ever had because every driver he ever gets just bitches the whole trip about how little they make and how much Lyft takes from them. **What the fuck??**

If you are so miserable, then uninstall the app and go get another fucking job.","Eh. This is a venue to blow off steam and gripe. Business man complains workers dislike being underpaid. That's surprising. jUsT uNiNsTaLl tHe ApP Ok maybe there are drivers that are not happy. But honestly I don't care. I am happy what I do, driving people around. Yeah you do have some nights/weeks/days were you barely make enough. But I don't think of it that way. I'm helping people get to and from point A to B.  I do go out if my way to open doors and help out with luggage.

And believe me I do get tips.. cash or in app. I agree, most of the people in this sub are such fucking downers. Yeah, I get why it's not as great as when you started but it's so obvious most of you have never worked in customer service before. I remember some little scumbag the other day posting about how his only job is to just drive and that's it...in the real world things aren't that black and white and if your too physically out of shape to get out and open a door for a senior citizen, your parents failed your fat ass. Lmao came for the tips to better my drive. So far I’ve learned nothing. I get tipped every ride so far and do it as a side gig. So don’t understand everyone’s bitching lol I'm convinced that this sub has an unspoken rule of discouraging drivers in hopes that the supply of drivers will go down and pay will go up. Lyft is never going to increase pay the lion's share of drivers out there only drive because they're still somewhat optimistic about their earnings, but they don't understand their costs.

Yeah we're gonna let them know, it's a kind of moral dilemma. You see people thrilled about grinding out $4/hr, convinced they're making $20. Lyft would be out of business if actual net earnings stared back at you when you looked at your app.

Your businessman can always take his business elsewhere. After all, he's utilizing a service where the price of labor is so low that the law is beginning to step in. I agree. I subbed for questions related to the app because I wasn’t sure if something was a bug. I can’t take this anymore. Yes! Great advice! Uninstall the app and get another job! Miserable human beings unite! There are those of us that have done rideshare driving for years, and we are just warning you of the scam.  In a nutshell, your income is going down and your expenses are going up.  That is financial suicide. Being paid less while fuel prices rise and wearing your self and your car down for hours tends to make anyone grumpy. But you must be inciting this “complaining” from the drivers. I agree not to complain about anything when you work.  In lieu of complaining I tell them that I like my job because I can take days off whenever I want , i can start working anytime, i sleep late and i have fun doing my job. 
Maybe because i've been saying this . Passengers don't tip me also. People or regular employees are envy of this. Bro chill, you're gonna hurt someone's feelings with all them facts. So, how often do you support said individuals by providing positive reinforcement in an effort to counter this flood of negativity? Oh wait, you don't? Ah, so you just came here to bitch and shake a stick at /r/Lyft huh? Yeah, we know your type. Cute post. And you believed him? Did he tip you? I call them HooHees. I’ve never met one in real life despite many Uber and Lyft rides so I can only conclude that their disgruntledness makes them more vocal. Don't forget entitled Let people be happy? Tell that to Lyft corporate that grossly underpays drivers.  I'll be a lot happier when the work I do is adequately compensated for. When it covers bare minimum expenses and I have some left over for the effort I provided which should have value. Does this make you miserable? Maybe you're the miserable one. Your ignorance is showing... maybe you're privileged enough to not feel the stress and pain that other drivers do... and some drivers can't find another job for multiple different reasons ranging from Medical to financially being locked in predatory loans. The bottom line drivers are suffering and you new motivated drivers are the problem because you just dont understand how these companies work... Yikes, nice gloating thread"
Had an uncomfortable experience tonight with a driver,10,10.59035754840407,Lyft,"Hey gang, tonight me and a friend were ordering a Lyft to get home after we went out to dinner. When the driver arrived he pulled away for a brief moment and asked how old we were, we responded that we’re 20 and 19, the driver mumbled to himself, locked the doors, cancelled the ride, and drove away. 

Me and my friend feel really creeped out by this and we can’t figure out why he would do that, but we did get really uncomfortable vibes from that guy. Thankfully the next driver was kind and respectful but is there a reason for a driver to ask our age and then deny us service when we’re not minors?","He probably thought you were lying to him. If you look younger he probably thought you were minors. Uber and Lyft policies don't permit drivers to pick up minors. Driver did a proper thing. He suspected you under 18, you told him 20 and 19, he didn't believe you and should ask you for IDs (it's totally legit and allowed by ToS), which would heat up the situation drastically. By canceling he just avoided the confrontation and low stars from both sides. Do you look younger? I’ve wound up asking people your ages and slightly older how old they are if I couldn’t tell. (I’m female so hopefully it wasn’t creepy.) And depending on how quickly you answered him he may have thought you were lying and had a prepared answer. 

He could have been a creeper, but it’s just as likely he thought you were minors and weren’t worth the risk of taking the ride. Consider it a good thing becuase driver thought you were to old for him, and he was prowling for under age victims. Just report his ass and get some free Lyft credits."

How Often Does Lyft Really Require Inspection,4,10.962822826192886,Lyft,"I got signed up by an Uber passenger who calls rides just to sign up drivers for Lyft and get the referral bonus.

My inspection is from June 2018 and I haven't been notified about needing an inspection. Is Lyft's even required yearly like Uber?","Once a year.  They  were dicks when I got mine redone.  Much more thorough, even looking at my engine. I live in Columbus, never had an inspection? What states do this? It’s so weird how some of you have really thorough inspections, and some of us didn’t. I literally pulled up to a tent, honked my horn, and showed I had working seat belts, and blinkers. It took 30 seconds. I’ve never done an inspection. As soon as I uploaded my paperwork to the site to sign up I could drive like 20 minutes later"

Give me a break","And there are times you help them with their bags and they don't even tip $1 Sucks to load bags but if you do a lot of airport and don’t the pax will thrash your bumper and scratch it up as they drag out their bags. Cant win either way. Got a bad rating once from and older lady who commented ""it is nice to help a lady with her bags"" she had a single bag and the airport security were telling all the drivers not to get out of their vehicles that day...happens lol I want to pay half,

You also must carry me piggyback from the terminal.

And wait in rideshare holding for 15 minutes while I retrieve my baggage.

1 star, would not load my Spotify channel, had the audacity to scold me for putting a half chewed hard candy into the console.

... just in general people are the worst and they don't care that they're hardly paying anything, they want something extra or don't mind inconveniencing you in some way. It depends on the bag.

Pax changing without getting cancelled??,9,11.630021900311112,Lyft,"It’s happened a few times this week, but when I’m online, I’ll get a ping “_____ is 5 minutes” and I’ll start driving, then it will say “pick up location updated” or whatever, then say “___ is 7 minutes” and reroute but won’t get noticed about a cancellation nor get a cancelled in my ride history? 
Just wanting to know what that is, I’ve only been driving for about a week and was wondering if that’s normal or a glitch.","if it gets rerouted to a different person, it’s likely that it thinks you’re closer to someone else that just requested a ride and gives the original rider to another driver. doesn’t happen every time, but that’s what i’ve noticed. The old switcharoo lyft pulls this BS on us if another driver becomes available closer to that PAX. To hell with the driver, they set us up with another ride but don’t get to know anything about it before like pax rating or if you know if it’s a long ride or not. I had that happen to me a couple times last week. The new pax turned out to be located in a really bad area. 🙄 Is it the same pax changing the pickup location? If so, it's not a cancellation - it's an update."
Am I completely F'd or is there hope for Tax Time?,28,12.222521900311113,Lyft,"So when I signed up for Lyft, I had no idea I would be an ""independent contractor"". I don't recall any portion of the signup process mentioning this or telling me I should probably..I don't know..consult a tax professional BEFORE proceeding any further. Even just a little ""hey save your receipts and track your mileage"" would have been helpful. But I digress....

So I signed up in December 2018. I began driving late January 2019, literally the last week of January. I don't have any receipts, I have no mileage tracked...NADA. In June, I let someone borrow my car and began the Express Drive program (Which is WAY overpriced considering how much money Lyft is making, especially with the new pay system, but I'll save that rant for a rainy day....oh look it's raining!) in June 2019. It's now approaching October 1st and I'm still doing express drive and I will be returning the car soon, once I can have some repairs done to my personal vehicle. 

I don't have a CLUE where to begin, what to expect, what to do when tax season comes around and it's so close I can smell its odor. Do I just start saving receipts now? Should I just call a tax professional and let them give me the bad news or is there still hope?","Tell the IRS you made a loss, its probably true I prefer to use an app to track miles. Personally I use one called SherpaShare but there are tons of options. They run on your phone in the background and automatically record your drives. You can classify trips after the fact. That would be helpful going forward. 

For the past, when you were driving your own car, your best bet is probably to review your rides and use the miles in those. That will leave off all the miles you drove without a passenger but I don’t know if you can get those now without making them up and risking being fucked if you get audited. 

During the time you drive Express Drive, though, you can’t claim miles since you don’t own the car. Hopefully you can look at credit card statements to find your direct costs for any gas and maintenance. You can deduct those. Don’t itemize deductions. You either choose to itemize or take the standard mileage deduction. ALWAY take the standard mileage deduction. Lyft and Uber don’t track all of your miles. It’s usually a 3:1 ratio of miles they tracked versus miles they didn’t. So whatever lyft says your miles driven was, multiply that by 3. That’s the constant variable I’ve see in the last 6 years I’ve been driving. I track every mile myself and that’s usually how much they’re off. 

I file with turbo tax business for $80. 

Your insurance, registration fees, phone bill, car accessories, washes, etc are all expenses you can deduct. Because you need those expenses to work. So deduct them. 

You can also deduct their commissions they take from you. If you do everything right you operate at a loss and you either don’t pay taxes or get money back. When I file jointly with the wife with a dependent and a house we got lots back because my income brought us down to the lowest tax bracket. That’s all you have to do. Google maps timeline stores EVERYWHERE you've been, literally, and tells you how many miles and time spent driving DO NOT RELY ON PEOPLE FROM REDDIT FOR TAX ADVICE! 

Seek professional assistance from someone with licensure. The money you save will be your own. Tax code is obfuscated intentionally. 

Anything done incorrectly has consequences you are responsible for. 

To answer the question. Yes there is time. Start using it now. Take the mileage deduction. You really need to start tracking miles. The app does tell you how much you drive, but it's only on actual trips. You are burning gas even when not on trip so count those too. Can you recreate a resonable mileage log for when you used your own car? Do you buy gas with a credit card?

Yes, you'll pay more taxes if you can't come up with reasonably supported expense deduction.

For sure start tracking mileage and saving receipts now. That can help you establish your average costs for the earlier part of the year. You can’t claim miles on a Rental, unfortunately. The only thing you can claim are the fees if any associated with acquiring the vehicle or repairing it if it’s your responsibility to do so and any meals you have bought when online. Express Drive already reduced your total earnings for each week, so you’ll claiming a lot less income than other drivers. At the end of the year LYFT will provide a more detailed statement. This statement will include the miles you drove when you were using your personal vehicle that you can claim. But you’ve missed out on all the deadhead miles you could’ve claim. Look into Quickbooks self employed going forward and AZLO, a free business checking account to seperate you spending. intuit self employed will help you. tracks mileage, you can set rules for transactions and etc. When you're doing Express Drive, there are no deductions for vehicle expenses other than gas and whatever you're paying to lease the vehicle, assuming you're only using it for business purposes. 

You cannot use mileage deductions for a car where you aren't responsible for maintenance and depreciation. 

If you're using it for personal and business, you have to figure out how to split the gas and lease expense.  If half the miles are business, then you can deduct half the expenses. You're fucked even if you did calculate mileage. I made $42,000 driving with Lyft and the government took 10 grand, even after mileage and deductions. FUCKED!"
I am a driver for Lyft In Michigan and I just recently start using express drive and I would like to know if someone could tell me how many rides do I need to give to be able to pay $24 a week?,5,12.411850604025853,Lyft,,"Please tell me how you are only paying 24 dollars/week for your rental?  Here in GA it is like 169 a week before taxes/fees.  Is that renting it per the day or what?  I'm definitely missing something lol.... It will say in the app in express drive section. I don't use it but I looked at it before and the cheapest rental in my area is $44 for 120 rides week it's probably around the same number of rides. If you started renting after 9/9 you don’t get rental rewards. If you have them, go to your dashboard and they’ll be at the bottom. Ok thanks I’ll check WTF!?"
I was one of the first immigrants that helped Lyft grow. Primetime was so common that we early drivers made $60/HR average consistently.,11,12.63746402995178,Lyft,Image,"Now we are nothing, absolute shit crap App that abuses drivers.

"Anytime I get a request for a long ride where it warms me that it's a 30-45+ minute ride, they always cancel after I accept. Does anyone know why? This is like a very reoccurring thing for me.",11,12.713575141076689,Lyft,,"They have second thoughts about the price. What is the year, make, and model of your car? Consider yourself lucky, unless you like deadheading back from dropoff. It's not you. It's your car. It's not just drivers who cherry pick their rides per se.  These passengers know that they can request a ride and then see the driver/make and model of the car.  If it's not what they want then they cancel real quick and then re-request a ride until they get what they are looking for.  Like someone else said, I think in your case it's the car, but I think sometimes they are making their decision based on the driver as well... I don’t know why, it never happened to me when I used to take those rides. Stopped doing that, it’s either an airport run during rush hour, or really far with no traffic. Either one is a time waster at the rates Lyft pays so I don’t accept them anymore. In all honesty, it could very well be your profile picture. Try getting a professional photo done that complies with Lyft standards. If it happens often for you it probably isn't because they're all worried about money like the top comment says. Maybe you look creepy and when they see you they decide they don’t want to spend that much time in your car."
Got a .5 mile fare today,11,12.76536912255817,Lyft,"Coming into a fare from 10 min out to a rental car place. So I’m thinking alright this should be a decent one. PING “your pick up has changed” arrive at an apartment complex and go a half mile for drop off and nothing for the next 20 min.

Walgreens does have restrooms... Ugh that’s about as tough as they get!  I don’t think they should switch us en route. I stopped driving because of stupid shit like this. I would always get one or two good ones and then get nothing but crap. Then I would average minimum wage by the end of the night dealing with stupid people like this, half of which were drunk and to lazy to walk half a mile home. My favorite was when they would try to get me to drop off multiple people who lived ""really close anyway"".  I haven't done it in a while because people were trashing my car and it wasn't worth it. I've done that before. Saw Bob Mould in Austin and the car was parked at the top of a steep hill. We were wiped out after the concert and getting back to the car was going to wipe us all out, so I pressed a button instead. I wasn’t so upset about the .5 mile fare but the fact that I was rerouted for it. I’ve taken people two blocks to pick up cigarettes then taken them right back home before. Shit just happens. I would have CANCELLED right then and there! I took one for 4 blocks once.

Does anyone know if you get paid for waiting at the first stop of a two stop ride?,5,12.856109863298911,Lyft,I know we get paid for waiting when initially picking up a passenger but I'm curious do we get paid for waiting at the first stop of a two stop ride? I often find myself waiting an inordinate amount of time and just curious if I'm getting paid for it.,"Yes.  Any time you're in the middle of the ride, you're getting paid.  Why are you waiting that long for pax at a stop?  The per minute for rides is worthless.  Tell the pax this, but in a nice way, like we don't get paid much for wait time.You know you don't have to wait for the pax forever right?  Set expectations and tell them you can only wait 5 mins at a stop, and then you're leaving.  If they need more time, tell them they can request another ride when they are ready to be picked up.  Don't let pax treat you like a doormat, which is what they are doing if you're waiting that long. I agree with sjsharks. We are paid for time waiting, but not very much. For example, my market pays $.09/minute for UberX and $.12/min for UberXL. Hardly worth waiting. Politely let your rider(s) know that you're willing to wait for a certain amount of time (my max is 5 minutes) otherwise they'll need to find another ride. Agree with the other posts about waiting.  You have to wait more than 10 minutes to make even 1 dollar in most markets so it's not worth it.  If your passenger is taking too long or doesn't come out in the time frame that you agreed in, simply press Ready to go and then drop off passenger. This was you will get paid for the distance and time you have already driven.  If you simply cancel the ride, you don't and it counts against you.  

Lyft surprisingly understands riders try to take advantage of this feature and tells in more detail what I just told you on their website under the help topics.  Also make SURE you do not let people leave things in car after the first stop.  This is a red flag and most of the time they plan to try and get you to wait on THEIR time because they have items in your car so in theory you can't leave them.  That is a lost item fee in my book 😅, but it's easier to just avoid all together by not letting them leave items in your car to out you in that predicament. All these guys gave stellar advice on this. tell the passengers they have 5 minutes per stop. if theyre going to take longer, tell them you need to be taken care of for the extra wait."
Lyft request I fill out a survey... so I did.,16,12.915646900346987,Lyft,"The question was ""What could Lyft do to be your preferred app""

Stop changing the bonus structure for ""our benefit"" only been driving a short while but I've gone through 2 different bonus structures, each worse than the last.  It's always accompanied by a BS message stating something along the lines of ""you spoke, we listened..."" and it's always nonsense.  It has never been to the benefit of the driver and you very well know it. 


Additionally the app is awful in terms crashing, bugs and what have you.  If there is an alley way near the address in question, even if the street would get you closer the app try's to take us to the ally way. Every. Time. Why!? 


Also, I'm about one surprise ride to the bay from booting customers out of my car and it's not their fault, it's yours. The fact that you dont tell a driver they will be driving to a location if it is over 30 minutes away is LUDICROUS. It's bad for the customer and the driver, but Lyft gets their money.  2 days back to back after driving for a straight 6+ hours I received a lyft request that said 17 minutes.  17! Not 90. Not 120. SEVENTEEN. Minutes! Only to pick up the customer and the destination is over 90 minutes away. That is NOT acceptable. So now the choice becomes missing a personal appointment OR kicking a lady going to her Drs appointment out of the car. Or get into an altercation with an angry customer. Both of which were the actual scenarios, simply because YOU choose not to disclose the drive time. Which. You. Have!  I GET that you need people to take these rides, but instead of making it more enticing by offering bonuses or bumps, you remove the location and direction information from the trip if enough people have cancelled the lyft now making it MY problem. It's disgusting and shady and you know that too.  


Now on to the next related issue. Now you've got me 90+ minutes from home with no real option but to drive back out of my own pocket cutting into an already low profit margin.  Now you're going to say, ""no no, we have a way for you to filter your rides so you can get Lyft's going in your direction! Isnt that great! Problem solved."" Bullshit.  Which you also know because after about 20 or 30 minutes of driving we get a cute message saying, ""well, we couldn't find a ride going in your direction, gonna log you off now."" WHY!? Just leave it on, why time it out? Ahh, that's right because you want us to either log off or pick up the next passenger regardless of the direction they are going, because AGAIN, its ONLY about YOUR profitability, not ours. You might then say, ""well just turn it back on"" except you've limited that to 6 a day.... oh, wait, no, its 2 now. My bad.  


Your driver assistance is 0. No way to call anyone if theres an issue.  I tried updating my number for over a week but your app couldn't handle that simple task so I had to email customer support. Fine. Except what does customer support do? Copy and paste their frequently asked questions and calls it a day. For over a week! Come on man. How hard could updating a phone number be? And when I email you stating that the process as outlined in the faq isnt working your response is to... copy and paste the faq!?🧐 REALLY? 


Now I'm not for this push into be considered employees, simply because the idea of this level of ineptitude being my boss makes my hair stand on end, but the reason all of this is happening is your continued squeezing every nickel of of the drivers that you can while telling us every change is ""our idea"". Dont piss on me and tell me it's raining. Work on these issues and you'd be my preferred app.","Damn, man.. That was beautiful. 🤤


Oh, and just a side note: I found out today that the surveys for Hertz (for anyone who uses Express Drive) are not anonymous and they are sent directly to the employees at the location where you rented your car. Yeah, I got a lovely email back from a guy who knows me by name. That was a pleasant surprise.. 😒 1. How people are able to choose shared rides and drive over an hr. 
2.  Companys have accounts for their employees,  that are considered shared rides. Leaving the employee no chance to give a tip for the ride.
3. Passengers that are more than 20 minutes away for rides of 5-6 minutes. Only these issues resolved and it'd be your preferred? Shit, eloquent as your piece is, I could double it easily. Why spend time on a fuckhole company I ignore in real world. Filter system is dogshit. After 10 minutes the filter expires even without finding anyone and that counts as 1. Now they dropped it from 6 to 2. Go off sis"
How often do drivers show up in other cars than what they're supposed to be in?,23,13.10821634479143,Lyft,"That's basically it. Just happened to me about an hr. ago. It was the driver but not the car and I was just like...whatever. 

I don't know the guys situation. Maybe hes a great guy and his other car is fucked upI'm sick, I'm tired, and if he's a serial killer then I guess it's all my own fault, I can accept that. ( very much not my usual take on things. I hate everyone and trust no one ) 

Turns out he was a dick but I did get home fine. 

Is this a normal thing? I've only taken about 20 rides with Lyft.

Edit: Thank you for all the feedback. He was sorta sketchy but I'm not gonna report him. I didn't tip him though. That was my way of saying 'fuck you' not even b/c of the car thing. He was just rude. I tip and I tip well so he missed out. He's the first driver I haven't tipped.

But I won't do it again. If I'm understanding someone's comment correctly and it's the truth then that driver is technically uninsured....???....i don't know but it sounds like a mess I don't wanna be involved in God forbid there was an accident. 

I'm all for helping a brother out but,

 To quote Jay-Z  

What you eat don't make me shit.","As a driver with multiple cars on my account, I can understand not remembering to change the vehicle at the top of the day. Still not an excuse, though.  I personally would refuse to get in any car that did not match the description or license plate that shows on the pax app. Nothing good will come of it. Cancel immediately and report. The driver, upon your cancellation should ahve enough brains to then go into the app and update his car, if that is the case. Also, Lyft is the easiest of the big 2 rideshare companies to add/update/delete vehicles. It only takes a couple of minutes to upload the documents and get the approval. Uber, OTOH, can be up to 24 hours. I had that happen once this summer. The lady said it was hot out so she wanted to bring her car that had better AC or something. She was really nice and a good driver otherwise so I did not report it and rated/tipped according to the level of service. I've taken tons of rides so I wouldn't say that's normal at all. That driver should have at least explained why he was using a different car. I've had it happen twice and both times the rides were fine, I'm not a frequent user either so I only have ever used lyft a handful of times. The drivers usually explain immediately why they aren't in the right car and they have been fine. 5 stars and move on, life is too short, painful and hideous to punish hardworking people. No, it’s not I’ll and if you report him, he could get his account closed permanently My husband drives Lyft and it took 3 requests for Lyft to correct his profile and put the correct car. He even sent them a photo and they still got it wrong. One of the few times ive been in the passenger seat of a rideshare, I was expecting a driver in a white dodge chllenger, and he showed up in a bright orange one. Drivers name, photo, and tag all matched. Asked him about it, he said hed emailed uber several times about it, and they just simply wouldnt fix it. Never take the ride and report them right away. We need to get this trash off the street. Definitely NOT normal, 1 Star, Safety Report, and lets get this scumbag out of the driver ranks. I rotate between 3 cars and it occasionaly happens where I forgot to change my vehicle Has not happened to me, but there was a driver that arrived had the car on the profile, but the driver was different. There was nothing wrong with the trip otherwise. I figured it was the spouse driving the car."
Rejected from Lyft with a 100% cleann driving record,12,13.168494122580245,Lyft,"I was rejected from Lyft despite having no criminal record and 0 infractions on my driving record - not even a speeding ticket. 

After I was rejected I requested my driving history report to ensure there were no errors, and, as expected, it confirmed that my driving record was completely clean. 

The only complication I can imagine is that it stated I only recently was issued a license. I lost my licenses and requested a new one shortly before applying to Lyft.  The ""Iss Date"" on my license was a week before applying to Lyft. However, I am 29 and have had a license since I was 16. 

I can't imagine any other reason I would be rejected from Lyft. Is it possible that they thought I had only been driving for a week? Is there anything I can do to appeal the ruling?","Nope and id consider it them doing you a favor. You needed a new account to post this? Checkr is shit (the site used for background checks). They did a full background check on me when it came to Lyft -- but not Uber or DoorStoleYourTipsInADash. I've been a professional driver for over 15 years with zero accidents, tickets, etc... 

So blame Checkr. Uber and Lyft wash their hands of any discrepancies. Thank them. Yeah, your better off not doing it. If you started now you would be on limited time until you eventually have to just go find another job anyways. Lyft sucks. You don't need that cancer in your life. No one does. That's why Uber and Lyft are on their way to failure, just like MySpace and AOL. I converted my license from another state about a month before applying and had no problems even though it was a super recent issue date. If you’re dead set on doing Lyft just find your local Hub and go ask these questions in person. Girl, Lyft will only hurt you, and even if you did get in and became a driver, Lyft will take a percentage of ever ride fare you earn, you'll have to pay for gas and bridge tolls, and for maintenance on your car?

If you still feel the need to get behind the wheel and drive people, apply with Uber, on the business side, they don't play as many games as Lyft does with it's drivers. If that doesn't work, try Uber eats or doordash, even instacart incorporates driving.

Now don't you feel bad about what happened with Lyft, they are wrong and stupid, be glad you didn't have to find that out later on down the road.

All hail the underappreciated rideshare driver, thank you all for your courage and determination. Happened to me. Luckily I had a picture of my older license in my Google Drive. I just sent that one and it approved me the next day"
Autonomous Cars,7,13.650218659617282,Lyft,"[LINK](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-car-50k-rides/)

I know this is only in limited markets and there are no announced plans to expand nationwide, but it’s hard to believe this won’t be the end result.

Can you see autonomous cars replacing the traditional Lyft model entirely? If so, when would you think this could be by? And would you try to be an operator of one of these vehicles if this became the future of Lyft “driving?”","There model relies on the employees shouldering the costs of cars, insurance, maintenance, etc.  You honestly think they'll have any more left to purchase large fleets, garage them, clean them, maintain them? Puts their model out the window. Bankruptcy is in their future. Hope you're reading this Dara. The hope for the self driving car and highway safety communities is that the entirety of America's manually operated vehicles will eventually be phased out leaving self driving cars exclusively on the road. The tech is still in the development phase and there's a couple kinks left to iron out, but overall they are far safer than manually operated vehicles, which will lead to fewer vehicle related injuries and deaths, a significant increase in workforce productivity, a large decrease in the amount of time cops firefighters and EMS have to spend dealing with accidents, etc. The initial costs will be higher but that'll drop off sharply once it becomes more mainstream. And because nothing beats the human mind for the ability to make a snap judgment call in an unpredictable situation (consider a trolly problem scenario for instance) self driving cars are likely still going to always require an awake and sober operator behind the wheel for those moments when manual override is necessary, which means driving jobs aren't going anywhere and might even see an increase in demand. My Tesla has Full Self Driving, so yeah. Within two years, if US regulations permit. This is where the model was intended to go from the start. It's where the R&D spend that they're pouring billions into per quarter goes.

After the driver cut is gone they may have a shot at eking out a profit. But just a shot. The cost to buy, equip, operate, and maintain a 24hr autonomous fleet will probably bankrupt them, anyway.

If they're smart, when all the auto manufacturers start bringing out their self-driving fleets, their best bet would be to offer their platforms as routing/call center solutions to them. >*Can you see autonomous cars replacing the traditional Lyft model entirely? If so, when would you think this could be by? And would you try to be an operator of one of these vehicles if this became the future of Lyft “driving?”*

There's no future in being the owner of a self-driving car for a ride-sharing company.  If there's money to be made in owning/managing the asset, then the rideshare companies will do it themselves.  If there's no money to be made in it, then they'll let 'partners' do it.  And they'll be in complete control over adjusting the rates at any time.  The rideshare gig lasts only as long as cars must be driven by humans. I see it as another option for people."
"WeWork is a prime example of ""counterfeit capitalism""",1,13.719929307776468,Lyft,Image,"Good to see that the public has learned from Uber's IPO. WeWork seems to have benefited from an ""irrational exuberance"" until now. It will eventually crash and burn unless they start making a profit."

Always see posts about Lyft's % take on fares. This is my averaged ratio. Doesn't seem too bad? What could be causing the discrepancies vs. other drivers who claim 40-60% take?,6,13.83961680777647,Lyft,Image,"Sample size of 88 rides. You must be getting bonuses or large tips I get one 50-55% Lyft commission during surge times about in about 20 rides. I complained to them about that and they refunded me once. Honestly, while I appreciate getting the largest percentage of a trip's cost as I can, I can't easily say I feel that Lyft taking a 60% cut is terrible. Without the platform they developed, the advertising they do, the troubleshooting, the customer service, etc. you'd just be a jitney hoping to get someone willing to pay you $5-10 to go across town. And let's be honest, getting 40% of the money you brought in for the company is an amazing pay rate! I'm an EMT for my day job, an average calls eats up about an hour, the bill starts at about $500-600 minimum, and even if the company only saw half of that then that would mean my partner's and my pay only amounted to about 10% of those earnings. Do you think McDonald's employees earn 40% of the cost of the food they sell per hour? Even office jobs don't see payouts that nice. Hell, CEOs don't even get that kind of percentage of earnings. So if all that Lyft wants is a 60% cut of what they charge then I count myself incredibly lucky. And if the cut they take is smaller than that well that's just gravy."
Deactivated for poor driving safety..I have video of each ride and 5.0 rating. Wtf can I do?,47,13.851676992975452,Lyft,"I have a 5.0 rating and videos of each ride woryk no idea

Thank you for the time you've dedicated to the Lyft driver community. As you know, in our constant effort to maintain a positive and safe community, driver accounts are actively monitored for ratings, passenger feedback, and any reports of safety concerns.

We’ve received multiple reports regarding your account, specifically for poor driving safety. Due to this feedback, coupled with your current driver rating, your driver account has been deactivated.

Safety is our top priority here, and we take these matters very seriously. Your account will remain deactivated and you will not be able to reapply with a new account.

In regards to your earnings, you will still receive any remaining payouts in your next scheduled direct deposit.

Regards","I drive like shit and no one bats an eye tho at 4.90 All you can do is write a letter and offer proof. Multiple complaints =validation from Lyft because they really dont care. I rebutted one complaint and continued  to drive  it was sheer luck they didnt believe that POS pax. Personally , id go with Uber until you can get a real job. Were you notified of safety concerns over a period of time? You want a code to join Uber? If you live in Dallas. Apply to ALTO. They picked me up in a day. I drove Lyft a year with 5* and over 2,000 rides. Alto pays 13 the hour and offer overtime if you want it. You get benefits and drive their vehicles (2019-2020) Buick enclaves. They pay for everything. All you need to do is drive good. Be nice. And brush the floors out after every ride. Clock in and out. Done and done. Paychecks are weekly on a Friday. Pay days run from Monday to Sunday. They do 2 days of on the job training. Just making sure you know how to drive good. Teach you how to use their app and teach you how to greet the customers. It is a luxury rideshare so you get a big chunk of high ticket passengers who tip big in cash. $10-$1000 and that is not a joke lol. My first week I got a $1000 tip.. amongst others. You just have to be a honest to God good person even when they don't act like one. What market are you in? I've noted 2-3 other posts where a driver claims they were deactived out of the blue for the same reason. 

My first thoughts outside of pax complaining would be a bitchass driver reporting your plate, a new background check or error related, Lyft slowly thinning over populated areas, or aliens. Blessing in disguise bro. Move on Typical gig app job bullshit...  Probably the best thing that could happen to you. Your poor driving coupled with your 5 🌟 rating is the reason.  If you have a 30% acceptance and 4 stars your good for life. You should contact Lyft’s safety team if that’s the case. Keep in mind though that 5.0 rating is just of recent rides, not all of them Yeah a 5.0 isn't really impressive anymore, literally any terrible ass driver can have a perfect rating. You're not gonna get deactivated for a couple lousy rides, there has obviously been a long series of complaints about your driving nothing. rejoice ! you're free.. now you can find something to do for decent pay that has an actual restroom.. no pay to park & no one telling you to move along you can't wait to pick up here. This happened to me this week as well.  Same story...  

I'm concerned that they are so ''woke'' that my public social footprint was the reason.  Has there ever been a poll of this group reviewing political leanings?  It's the ONLY reason I come up with.  They will not even give the date(s) & time(s) so I can get the video from the dash-cam recordings.  

I'm a straight, white, married conservative male.  I love President Trump and am one of those depolrables youv'e heard of.  I'm also vocal about calling leftist's out.  

That's polar opposite of what Lyft's culture is all about.  Virtue signalling the loonies in San Fran! I doubt this is safety related, I think they are trying to get rid of a lot of drivers because news was talking about how too many rideshare drivers on the road are causing accidents.  Lyft and Uber now even put drivers offline for hours by force and driver can't go back online so they can decrease road congestion.  Are you in California OP? Sue lyft for discrimination Sounds like you are a crappy driver. Go get a real job that doesn’t include endangering the public."

United , Delta and American were all under $200 - why dafuq pay $327 + a ""healthy Tip"" (read $100) to drive it? 

Are you lugging a bunch of cargo? There are other apps for that. You can rent a trunk , hatchback or other truck payload bay for less money. Well I drive in MPLS and I would not take it unless I had a guaranteed return and an adequate amount of rest. But you should see what happens. Surely there is a hip bus service between these major cities, non Greyhound. I doubt anyone will take this. The max fare in your city is 400, hence the 376 price. They most likely won't take it because they won't have a fare back. So what you are paying will only cover half of their time and fuel spent driving  you there then going home. Seriously why don’t you just fly? It would probably be less money i'd take that.  easy. if i were in chicago. figure a tank and a half for gas ish, say $50 in gas, and maybe $20 in snacks. youre still making three hundred profit.  


make a trip from eastern orlando to miami. i'm down. If memory serves they just lowered the rates for Minnesota for Lyft and I believe it's around .24 or .28 cents per mile. For me that would not be worth it if you would like to be nicer to your driver I recommend taking Uber even if it's a little bit more. Can you even take a left across state lines like that? just book 4 rides.  Take 1 ride 1/4 way, jump out, hail another Lyft.  Take 2nd lyft another 1/4, jump out, hail another lyft... Rinse, repeat.

You seem to recognize that their bad attitude about Lyft is justified... But since your market is decent, you want them to shut up and stop bumming you out?

Welcome to the SCAM! u/Lyft Doesn't anyone look at their ride details for everyride?  I can't believe people are so asleep that they just take whatever they get and make assumptions.  It's right there in the app people, go into your history and start waking up to your reality. This is why the whole ride sharing industry is bs. Nothing is straightforward or honest. The same thing happen to me this morning... I went as far as to request a breakdown from a trip I took as a passenger to see if Lyft would provide information to passengers about this theft - still no reply... They should give a fee breakdown to the passenger, too. I'd like them to know it's not the drivers that are getting a significant piece of what they perceive to be overcharged for rides. Other gigs apps found a good way of fixing this. For example ProxyPics tells you exactly how much you will make for the distance you drive. So atleast I know I’ll make 35 dollars for an hrs worth of driving if I choose to pick up the requests. Were you paid a base fee plus a per minute and per mile as per your rate card? I see that all the time, this pretentious a hole told me lyft operates on a 80/20 split. That person got mad. They need to take that much because they're dumping millions into a race to get a car that drives itself. They don't know how to do things in order. How about establishing your company first? They are creating their own problems and making that problem worse in an attempt to run away from it faster. What I mean is they're making drivers unhappy, unreliable, and too poor to provide great service, all because Lyft is taking our money to finance machines that may be ready to replace us in 10 years if they're very very VERY lucky. There is a term for this kind of behavior. It's called insanity. I don't get why you're surprised at what you earn, you get paid per mile and per minute a flat fee, who cares what lyft gets?  Look at your rate card. any ride 3 miles or under, driver doesnt get shit. You can see the Earnings Breakdown of every ride to see what passengers paid. They take more when its a ride where the payment is from welfare. Secondly, people need to stop looking at Lyft like it's a wage job and need to look at it like a business. Revenue-expenses=profits.

Dude was a prick per usual, and he said it was because of transportation regulations for  an agency and that it also applied to busses.  I can’t remember the acronym now but I looked it up after we got off the phone and it was a private company vaguely related to transportation. IT WAS NOT a government agency that could enforce a regulation.   I think it’s bullshit and yet another one of the possibly illegal things lyft is doing to scam drivers out of money. Yeah dude. Fucking bullshit Destination modes?"
"Am I the only driver who has never had a bonus or seen any personal power zones and streaks? I get the hot spots but they don't seem to make a difference or do anything. I just see all these 15-30$ bonuses from the other drivers online and wondering how to get them, too!! Feeling left out lol",11,14.888482548597235,Lyft,Image,"It doesn't happen as often you think. I'm in boston which is a busier city but I only see bonuses of a couple dollars at peak hours. You see pics of $15-30 on here because they are rare. id be lucky to catch one maybe two in a night. Generally it meant getting slightly more on a ride but it wasn't something i strived for. Its basically just a gimmick to keep you driving....like the off duty carnies walking around with giant stuffed animals during the fair trying to get you to play. I had one for 28$ in blue zone . 36 was in red , but didn’t make it . It was near airport Bonuses only show up when they desperate to get people in an area for whatever reason. The Vegas/paradise area is so over saturated with drivers that they never need to offer a vonus, you might get them on major holidays but unlikely. It's the same here in San Diego unless you hover around downtown constantly I know I felt left out too!!! I kept sending emails and they would reply but it’s like if they were beating around the bush. So annoying. I wish I had incentives :( It’s depends in Vegas did you drive during live is beautiful, I live in downtown so I drove a bunch that weekend just cause I could not sleep anyways at home and pulled about 150 in bonuses and about ten dispensary drops, but outside of events like that or concerts letting out I see very little On another note... THAT GIANT AIRPORT BUBBLE OMG. It always blocks my view! From what I have read, it's also based on the number of rides you have given. It did not specify whether that meant for the day, the week, the month or even your lifetime rides. One would think someone who is actually a Lyft employee would be able to clarify but.....Who remembers the days when we got the surge pricing as well?!?!?! That was the shit. Pfft...personal power zones..... Why should they give you a bonuse when you're still out there working? 

Bonuses are unique to drivers now"
Screenshot from a search I made regarding Lyft repossessing my rental after one week. Not sure why.,11,15.019339030078717,Lyft,Image,"Same exact thing happened to me. I was a loyal renter and had rented for six months. I missed the minimum ride requirement one week because I had bronchitis. I paid the difference and I went to the hub to get it handled. I was told the two times I went that it was handled and it would update in a week or so. The next week, I get a knock on my door at 9am from the tow company saying ""The tracker on your car shows it in the garage. We need it back or we'll call the police.""

They towed it, I went to the hub and they acted like I had never tried to resolve it with them. They attempted to bill me $500 for the recovery fee, but I blocked my debit card on it. My vehicle was spotless. I had a car wash pass and had it washed and vacuumed daily. On the report of the return it says the floor and seats were in ""very poor"" condition, even though it was spotless daily. So guess what? Lyft took my deposit. I ended up getting Wells Fargo to refund my deposit in full and I will never look back to Lyft, not even as a rider. They linked my balance owed for the recovery to my passenger account so I can't use it as a pax either. That's fine. Fuck lyft. I am done with them. 

I switched to Uber/Fair and I've never been happier. My pay is easily double, Fair is a great rental partner, and I'm making as much in 40 hours with Uber as I did with 80 hours at Lyft. wow, thats ridiculous.  Good news is if they try to bill your credit card,  you have your contract which you should probably go ahead and forward. Do you have to have good credit for Fair ? Probably a mistake"

I drive 15 to pick up the passenger. Doesn’t say 2 stops but the single mom wants to drop off her daughter at school - I agree. I then take her to work. After it’s all said & done I made a whopping $4.93 while Lyft made $6.22. I contact support they said “fares & rider payment are not based on distance, time or the base fare” so, how did you come up with that magical number where you make more than the person actually doing the work? Fucking Disgusting!!! LYFT YOU ARE DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I fucking hate this fucking lying ass apps constantly robbing single moms & pocketing the money for what fucking reason other than greed. FUCK YOU LYFT!!","so now you know. The question is are you going to keep driving or chasing the carrot? LYFT denied me a cleaning fee from a puker on camera claiming not enough evidence. Haven’t driven since. Just wait until someone destroys the inside of your car and Lyft says due to policy they cant reimburse you... 

There is a reason why Lyft is cheaper than Uber. They recently cut rates to $0.35 per mile. Why are you still driving for them? Damn... Tell us how you really feel haha. Welcome to the club"
So my car is in the shop. I decided to use the Express drive for a while until I got my car back. Woke up this morning and the car was gone!!! They repo’d it. Don’t know why. I met my rides quota and I made enough to cover rental. So I’m guessing it’s not worth it. Lol. Oh well.,23,15.10817004862207,Lyft,,"Wait, was it repo’d or towed? This doesn't sound right. You've had it for barely more than a week. They're not going to come get the car. It's a rental car. It's secured. They'll get paid even if you don't make enough money. And you'd definitely have an e-mail or a call from someone official if they were going to take the car, because they don't want to have to clear your crap out of it.

You say the police said it was repo'ed by Lyft, but ACAB and I doubt that a rental company taking their car back with the spare key they have would ever be registered with the police. You probably said something about it being an Express Drive and the dispatcher didn't want to fuck with it and told you that. Call the rental company and ask them if they took the car back. I would say 80% chance they didn't. My money is on the previous driver getting their car yanked back by Lyft but Lyft didn't clear the vehicle from the pickup list. You should contact Hertz directly and a Lyft Rep at the local hub and get it sorted. Do NOT ASSUME this is resolved and they will not come after you for more. You need to get them to correct the root cause of the repo. Lyft called and explained that this car was repossessed due to the prior renter and was just never taken off the system.  They are refunding me the past two days. 😒🤨 You pay Lyft, Lyft pays the rental company. It's no secret Lyft is losing money and maybe they're behind on payments to rental companies. ""for a while?"" How long? You have to check it in every 4th week at a minimum regardless of how much you're earning because its a rental. I made another post of a screenshot from a search I did earlier.

Advice on getting tips from the wealthy?,24,15.574258011609867,Lyft,"Rich people are so god damn cheap it’s sickening. I work the airport here in San Diego a lot, and every time I get a ride to one of the wealthy beach communities I get stiffed, even if there was a great conversation along the way. Worse yet is I suspect 75% of these trips are business trips meaning their ride is expensed and/or reimbursable. Any advice on how to get some love from these misers?","There really aren't any secrets. In my opinion people who tip for service will tip, while those that don't really won't. All you can do is offer a safe, comfortable ride and hope you get a tipper. I actually say “please leave a tip in the app if you can afford it”
If they dont 1 star.

It’s passive aggressive but I am so far beyond giving any fucks. You could post a sign in the back of your car to the effect of ""tips welcome"" though I admit, for me personally I find the idea of directly asking for a tip a little tasteless. Either they'll give one or they won't. Offering the best experience possible is your best bet. There's the obvious stuff: clean car, good hygiene, non-offensive conversation including silence when called for, safe driving with a solid fast route, etc. Other considerations, watch the music choice, it's good to have background music but you don't want it too loud and it should be inoffensive. I typically play Vitamin String Quartet myself. Amenities can be a cheap way to cater to your passengers as well. Water bottles, mints, hand sanitizer, and tissues can go a long way with a pretty minimal cost. But in the end usually someone either will tip or won't and it's not something you're likely to influence. 1 star there ass and maybe the will tip there next drive Drive a Tesla. Tips for days Generally speaking, rich people don’t get rich by being generous with money. 😂😂😂😂😂 Hmm that's tough.  Rich people like other rich people though.  So if you act like you don't need the money, are just driving for a lark cause you like talking to people or just love your city or whatever, reverse psychology might work! The theory goes, they want you to hate your miserable job, get a better one and make something out of your life. Tell 'em you think Donald Trump is Christ come back to life.

Chicago Advice Please! Should I buy 2012 SUV Vehicle to Drive for Lyft XL -- Or 2017 Lincoln to drive for Lyft Lux?,8,15.876827456065351,Lyft,"Hello, I'm having to buy a car anyway because I moved from downtown into to the suburbs (near Tinley Park) and I'm considering doing LYFT as a side gig, maybe 20 hours a week. My budget is right around $18,000.00 for a used car. This means I can afford approximately afford a 2012 large SUV (which would allow me to drive for Lyft XL) or a 2016/2017 used luxury sedan (like a Lincoln which would allow me to drive for Lyft Lux). I can't afford to buy an SUV that would qualify for Lyft Lux XL. 

Can anyone advise me on which service has the most demand and would probably make the most money?  Based on your experience if you were in my situation would you buy an older SUV or a newer sedan that would qualify for Lyft Lux?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Note: I am NOT going into debt just to drive for Lyft as I do need a car anyway and have budgeted accordingly.","I can't speak to your market but I will say this, a friend who drives XL/Lux (in my market) and I recently compared notes. 

He averages $4.00 more per ride. He averages 15 rides per 8 hours, I average 20. 

He makes on average 60 more per shift, which does not come close to covering the additional gas, insurance, depreciation and maintenance costs that an XL/Lux vehicle requires. 

If I see you, I'd buy a $5,000 vehicle like a used Prius. If you want or need something bigger, get a minivan. Buying anything with the express purpose of using it for rideshare is a terrible idea. If you already owned the SUV that'd be one thing, but going out of your way to spend $18,000 (plus all of the extra expenses) to earn $15/hr is a really really poor decision. Will you be driving for Uber as well? I think driving for both would yield more rides. If you do buy the Navigator and are only doing it part time, I'd probably recommend just doing premium rides (Uber/Lyft XL, Uber Select,Lyft Lux). You wouldn't put as many miles on it by doing economy rides (Uber Pool/X) and would get higher rates."
Does Lyft put a hold on new rides after a driver cancels a pickup request?,5,15.89815847458387,Lyft,"I had to cancel a ride today and I did so immediately after my phone accepted the ride, something I haven’t done in 119 rides (still new to it all). Now, in 2 hours 18 minutes, and during a higher peak time in my city and during a convention, I have had ONE ride. I’ve mostly stayed parked, having moved around 5 or 6 times — might staying parked be to my detriment? 

After making $29 an hour in 8 hours yesterday, this is crazy to me.","It says in their website that if you cancel more than 15 rides per 100 then you might be at risk for deactivation. Might just be a coincidence.  They are making WAY TOO MUCH MONEY off of us on each ride to be petty and ""punish"" you 😁 It seems like it sometimes for sure. But if you open up the rider app you’ll see multiple other drivers very close by. Staying parked just doesnt work. You gotta stay moving.

I also feel that if you're having too good of a session, they start throttling you. 

It's all just really random really. If anything they do probably hook up people with high rating and high acceptance rates.

I often cancel rides in San Francisco, literally back to back. 5-10 in a row even, and I'm still getting hits. They definitely don't put a hold on you. Once I wanted to turn off driver mode during a very busy period and kept getting trips over and over before I could hit the button to turn it off. Each time I hit decline it would simply immediately pop up a new trip instead. I must've declined 4 trips in a row before being able to get to the button to leave driver mode. No."

2.) Don't rent from Lyft's rental program even if you do plan on driving 50+ hours a week as their required metrics to remain in good standing are quite difficult and stressful to maintain.

It's okay though because you got to choose the hours you had the app on. /s If you don’t mind me asking, what hours do you usually work? And are you using a rental? thats why i quit Charity work basically Why would you ever ever ever rent a car from Lyft?? You are being willfully stupid at that point, paying more per week to lease one of their cars than it would cost for a monthly payment on a new or pre owned vehicle at a stealership. Hey for sure don’t complain when you aren’t providing all the info. Don't rent from Lyft and you'll do somewhat better. [deleted] Why is that so low??? What happened here? That's indecent What market are you in? (What city) Send this to the media and your local and state government officials.  They need to see it. Ok...this is a little out of context. No one is making us utilize the rental program so the earnings are not reflective. I drove for less than 3 hours today; 9 rides; $53.05 - market areas do matter.

But if you are using a program to rent a car then this is not truly the amount. Bruh that’s bs ... you probably cherrypicking rides in that same amount of hours I make $700-1000 .... which is more than enough for a rental and expenses Doesn't make sense"
Question about car inspection,10,16.154859863497595,Lyft,"Hi everyone, I am trying to become a driver for Lyft and the only thing I have left is the vehicle inspection. How much does Lyft care about the undercarriage of the car? On my Elantra, the plastic cover protecting the engine compartment has a hole in it, but is otherwise secured to the underside of the car. (long story short, between sliding over a few parking blocks and someone severing a bolt holding the shield on, caused it to dangle, which then caught on the road and broke off a piece). Is this something they will look at during the inspection? I'd say about a quarter of the shield is missing. But nothing is noticeable from above the car, you really have to look to find it. I am planning on replacing it, but that's going to take a few weeks. I don't mind waiting until it's fixed, but I'd rather not if I don't have to. Thanks!","They didn’t look at the undercarriage of my car. Uber was more extensive but only so they could sell me bulbs to approve me. I could have bought the bulbs at some auto parts store but for $20 it can be their pain in the ass. Honestly the chances of them checking it are slim, even more so if the Lyft Hub is busy.

Granted I had a 'newer' vehicle, but the rep who inspected my vehicle literally just walked around my car and checked to see if the windows were working. Didnt even attempt to turn the vehicle on. I had no idea they do car inspections. What city are you in? Neither Uber of lyft inspected either of the cars I’ve driven No one came to inspect my car. I was approved within an hour of applying. A bit scary, but true. oh dude you're fucked  
they're never gonnna let you drive again, i'm sorry."
"Drivers, stop taking shared rides...",4,16.648852919053148,Lyft,"EDIT: Or at the very least, go offline after accepting your first shared passenger and cancel any and all passengers that Lyft adds after you've logged out of driver mode.

Lyft has been adding new riders to my queue on shared rides for several months now after I log out of driver mode (Uber doesn't do this, not even on shared rides). Whenever Lyft adds riders to my queue after I've logged off, I'll manually remove them (one of the main reasons being that you can't see passenger ratings when Lyft adds a rider in the middle of your current ride, and I don't pickup passengers with low ratings). 

Lately, I've been getting what I consider to be threatening text messages from Lyft informing me that I'm at risk for deactivation for cancelling too many rides. I RARELY cancel rides that I actually accept. The cancelled rides they're referring to are rides they've arbitrarily added to my queue AFTER I turn driver mode off.

Drivers, you'll find that the overwhelming majority of the fare goes to Lyft on shared rides after you picked up your first passenger(s). I've found that it's simply not worth it, for drivers.

Today, I received an email informing me that I've been deactivated for 29 minutes because I'm creating a poor experience for passengers because I'm cancelling too many rides and my driver rating is too low... My driver rating is 4.99 out of 5 stars and I have damn near 3000 rides... These people are truly delusional and try and tow the line as much as possible when it comes to treating us like employees while giving us absolutely ZERO employee benefits.

Riders, if you're choosing Lyft over Uber because you feel Lyft treats their drivers better, stop drinking the kool-aid. Lyft used to put on a much better facade, but have shown me they give zero fucks about their drivers. While on the other hand Uber has made great strides in improving driver experience.

We are independent contractors after all, right? Lyft has no right to demand that we continue to accept riders (whose passenger rating we can't see) after we've logged off. What are your thoughts? Spread the word.","And at least now you can cancel that added passenger (which is what you're doing and why you're cancellation rate is up). In the past if you tried cancelling that new rider, it would cancel the entire ""line"" and you got paid $0.00.

The only way around that is to stop taking Shared rides. But of course, that is not always feasible. About 75% of my pings are Shared. It no longer allows me to cancel additional riders.  The X is there but nothing happens when I hit it.  I usually avoid shares but at the airport they screw u because you have to start driving before you know your customer It used to be that Lyft did treat their drivers better than Uber.  But now it is pretty much the opposite.  Lyft treats their drivers mostly worse than Uber now.  They basically want drivers to work for 30% of the fare and to be happy about it and provide world class service while making $3 an hour. Accept the first shared ride and delete all the added ones. Fuck lyft.

If I start getting deactivation warnings I’ll just stop accepting shared rides altogether."

They want to verify my ID. I get that. That's why in the past I have submitted real-time photos of myself and my driver's license. Asking me to submit my full and complete SSN into the phone app though is another matter, and is contrary to all advice regarding protection against identity theft. So far Customer Service doesn't get it that they are over-stepping their boundaries here.","Then you won't be able to drive. I think it's too much, but it's their show. Its because they have to report what you make for taxes so the government can make sure you're not lying about your earnings. Any job/gig where you make money would require an SSN. Lyft already has your ssn. They are requesting it again because drivers will rent their accounts to other drivers, this is a way to verify it is you since you would probably not give your ssn to another driver.

What issue do you have with it? It is not like some human is manually checking that the ssn number matches You can do it over the website instead Sounds like it’s part of their “enhanced identity verification”: https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/d7iyse/what_are_lyfts_14_new_safety_features/

Reported A Lyft Driver for the First Time,6,17.214651530175296,Lyft,"I had my first bad experience with Lyft and thought I'd share! I needed a Lyft to go see my best friend in the hospital in Nashville (she'd just had a baby). She seemed cool at first... told me I could sit in the front because it's cooler. She then asked to stop and get gas which was fine. I went in to get a drink and when I came out, she wasn't in the car or anywhere to be seen. I waited over 6 minutes and she was like ""oh! Had to go to the bathroom"". Again, that's fine.. nothing to get mad over. 

Then we were back on the road and she was like ""I saw you limping... what's wrong?"" I explained I had my hips replaced a few years ago and sometimes they get stiff. To that, she replied, ""Really? You look so young though. But I bet they give you good drugs for that. Do you have any pain pills or xanax? I'll take you back home real quick to get it. I'll even pay you."" After I said no I thought that'd be that then the whole ride there she continued to bring it up occasionally. Wanted to know if I had any in my purse maybe. (Which I did but obv didn't tell her that) She seemed like she'd already had some of her own tbh. Her speech was slurred and her driving progressively got worse. In Nashville, she started screaming at passing drivers who were literally not doing anything wrong. At one point she rolled down her window to scream, ""get out of my way, faggot!"" She kept on saying how she hates Nashville and driving in it which is why she always takes a hydro or roxy before going there. I tried to get her to drop me off somewhere but she kept saying he couldn't find anywhere to stop. At one point she began driving into oncoming traffic then my scream made her realize what she was doing and she got onto a side road. I also got to hear how she used to be addicted to meth and coke. 

It was honestly terrifying. I'm usually super chill and open but this was beyond that. I just thought I'd share my experience and vent a little. :)

I did get an amazing Lyft driver on the way home, so that was a relief! Also, Lyft has processed a refund for my horrifying ride and took the necessary precautions against her. (Hopefully firing her.)","Holy shit! Glad you're okay. Well unless someone else reports her it prolly won’t happen because one passenger could be a disgruntled rider. I’m a driver and I have a dash cam to keep passengers behaving. I’ve been reported for drinking and driving because I wouldn’t allow open alcohol in my car. Ironically I don’t even drink. But remember shitty ppl go both ways I’m sorry for your experience but that’s the chance you take just like I chance getting a passenger that’s gonna attack me. Omg that driver was nuts. She should not be driving at all let alone be a rideshare driver.  You did the right thing by reporting her and Lyft would be crazy to let her be on their platform ever again! Glad you’re ok.  Please report all of these things to Lyft as a safety concern.  I would also specifically cite the times you asked to be let off and she refused.  That’s basically kidnapping. 

Next time someone propositions you for drugs at the gas station, I’d recommend not getting back in the car. If she was driving reckless and wouldn't let you out why didn't you call 911."
"This was my second ride ever. The trunk is also completely full. Took this during a ""quick"" stop on the way back to get something. 30 minutes later she came back with another buggy.",70,17.250299678334486,Lyft,Image,"You are a generous man I had picked up and older women once at Home Depot. She had 12 bags of soil, and helped carry them into her garage. All for $3.67. Did you count the fiver as part of the 16$ you made? I have a bad habit of doing that when averaging out my hourly. Then I'm like ""Hey wait a gotdurn minute! Let me subtract those tips and what did I really make."" Because most riders are not generous with the monetary tip. Just wanna give you a heads up come tax time, since it's only your second ride. If you plan to ever take the standard mileage deduction, you have to take it the first time you do your taxes with rideshare. If you do not do it your first time, you can never do it with that car.

I used my girlfriend's (now wife's) car for my first year in 2017 and since I didn't legally own it nor was I legally leasing it I couldn't do the standard mileage deduction. Man I fucking wish I could have just given her a dollar and she legally leased it to me, I could have done it then.

(btw a tax assistant from TurboTax suggested that lease idea not me)

Also, the 1099k Uber will give you will show that you made WAY more money than you ever saw. Keep records of how much you actually made, subtract that number from the number on the 1099k and write it off as a business expense (if you can with the standard mileage, not sure since I never did it) since that extra money the 1099k claims you made actually include Ubers service fees. Basically they are claiming all the money they made was first yours that you basically paid to them after you made all the money the rider paid. it's fucking slimy and I want to help you not overpay your taxes. 

Good luck with the driving! I hope you learned that if someone pings from a grocery store, Walmart, Target, Sams Club, Costco, BJs, or any other store... nope nope...  I never did in the 3 months I drove, I learned quickly.  It will be a very short trip, dirty up your car with all their crap, and probably didn't even get tipped for all your time and effort.  Nope nope ride! Lmao - I would have left her and the noodles These forums are going downhill quick, we have a new wave of drivers bragging about 100% AR, waiting infinite amounts of time, allowing pax to break all the rules. Wish the veteran posters would come back. 

The blind leading the blind. The look on your face, priceless, haha 30 mins? Fuck that. I took a handicap lady with her full size wheelchair and even pushed her for a-bit into the restaurant she was going to, at-least she tipped me 4$ . I had similar situations and never got tipped Live and learn, gotta be polite but firm when it comes to this sort of thing. 

Good luck with your future rides! Please tell me you were tipped... That’s instacart right there. Might as well do that too! Oh you poor soul. Credit to you for doing it at all. Welcome to the business-- it isn't all this insane. 2nd ride ever? Story checks out. Give it 6 months. You will have less patience for this type od shenanigans. glad this one worked out but normally is not the case. Wait more than couple minutes = ending the ride. At least looks like she stocks up so probably doesnt happen too often.. Blimey, that Wayne Rooney's really let himself go.   
(OP you are a saint). Guess there was a sale! I would be like forget that! but you can tell the person really was just tryna get they life. 

&#x200B;

Im glad you helped this family get their food! they probably were relying on that single lyft! 

&#x200B;

im glad you made a decent amount on that part. Hope you get some bigger rides soon 😂😂😂😂😂 Jesus christ... nominate you for sainthood F Omg... crosspost to /r/ramen Thanks I’ve had a lot of kind drivers help me out with marketing’s one recent months due to big struggles and not having a car and it’s been a blessing. Only ever had one salty lady show up at a market once and lie to me about the person she was looking for to get out of doing the ride and she kept saying that my information was wrong somehow and I should have to cancel so she gets the fee or some shit. 

But other than that one sour apple most have either been helpful and nice or just gone along with it with no complaints so it’s been great. 

Thanks for helping this person out. 

Although I’ve never loaded a back seat before! Lol. You will learn over time where and when to do pickups to benefit YOU.  When I started, I had countless $4 hours.  When I quit I was averaging quite a bit more. Second ride indeed... You'll learn :).

Never let people leave their shit in your car. Also, if they can't get all their crap in your car by the time 5 minutes rolls around, cancel the ride and collect your fee. Tell them to request another ride and see if you get it.

How long did this ride take from the time your passenger first put their junk in your car to the time you dropped them off and they unloaded all their crap? How much did you make? Did they tip you? Also, what was their passenger rating and how many stars did you give them after the ride? I can almost promise you that a passenger who's this entitled and inconsiderate (assuming they didn't leave a BIG tip) has a low passenger rating.

It's good to be generous when possible but at the end of the day, we're in this to make money.

I know you're new and you want to go above and beyond, but don't spoil passengers. Because they're going to be in for an extremely rude awakening when they meet an experienced driver who refuses to be taken advantage of. We don't get paid enough to just sit there and wait all day for people. If your wheels aren't turning with a passenger in the car, then it's not worth your time. Hope this helps. yeah nooooooooo. cancel that shit. call lyft tell them why. Did she at least tip? Fuck that lol fuck that shit, you should have told her to kick rocks. You should have politely grabbed a buggy, then politely put all of those groceries in said buggy and then politely left that bitches shit at the customer service counter. 

She knew exactly what she was doing, guaranteed. You are a social worker and you get hot dog money. You gunna learn, boy. “Ma’am this is a Wendy’s” as I slowly pull off and cancel."
Pricing question,10,17.64264921537152,Lyft,"I take the same ride every Sunday night. It was 8 per ride but has slowly crept up to 15... every time.  It’s a half mile ride to off-airport parking. Today, same thing.... $15 for a .5 mile, 5 minute ride. I enter a different address, about 14 minutes away (usual hotel) and the price is $12. How can it be cheaper to got 14 minutes and 11 miles than .5 miles and under 5 minutes? Is this their dynamic pricing because it is pretty upsetting. I have no choice as you can’t simply walk off this airport.","They use machine learning to price trips, in other words they know the following:
- your opportunity cost (short term parking), and also
- few people change their minds due to this ride being marked up on a sliding scale - it's to the airport.

And their algorithm is working hard to gain intelligence on you so they can mark it up as much as possible for you in your demographic while obtaining the highest bump to revenue as possible.

There's no such thing as a rate schedule anymore, pricing is determined by consumer intelligence on a group-wise basis. A handful of retail outlets have been experimenting with similar ideas.

Per opportunity cost: it's a rare individual who would save money by parking at the airport. Usually comes down to how often you fly or how many days are trips tend to be. You may find that if you start checking prices and then not booking lifts, but the Lyft app still sees you at the airport, your price may go down. Side note: just bought monthly long term parking pass for airport so won’t need a lift to car anymore. Use to be worth the savings but as Uber/Lyft start charging me 30 bucks round trip for 1 mile total driving... it’s totally not. I’m happy to be done with this. Aggravating knowing that you’re just being ripped off by a greedy algorithm. Let the drivers set their own price. Just out of curiosity...  How did people get between the lots and the terminal before rideshare?  Every commercial airport I've ever been in has shuttle services between parking lots and the terminals, and they're free with your parking stub *edit - if they even check.* Because Lyft is kind of a greedy company. I also guarantee you the driver is getting only $3-$4 for that ride as the length means it's only a ""minimum fare."" They've been doing this for years now, jacking up customer prices while decreasing the amount drivers get."

I would NOT hit up casinos. Most sinking feeling I've ever experienced, spending any amount of my own money. Nice! Dude I love certain areas in cali because you wont get a pickup. So you spend like 5-15 minutes in one of those zone sections and just rack up to 15-20 bucks and just get w.e. rode(hopefully it's a short one) and just do it again lol Same thing around Lincoln CA, very nice PPZ bonuses."

Got a lyft ride last night and the driver had another car “following” us with two guys and I noticed,37,18.557961715379797,Lyft,"Me and my wife took a Lyft home from a wedding last night that we ordered with her name/account and as we are driving our 40min trip I noticed the car in front of us was there for the entire ride on the highway and told the driver that it was weird he was getting off at our exit. The driver just said “yeah”. Our ride continued and every road (there was 7 different roads) we were about to turn on the car in front of us did first. We continue driving to my house and the car turns on my block before we do so I tell the driver to bring us to a 7-11 down the block cause somethings not right. The driver then tells me that the other car is with him just in case he has any problems with passengers. We get to my house and I tell my wife to go inside and I grab my stuff and get out of the car and the other (security) car has driven off before I even get out. So they weren’t there to protect him.
My question is what was that all about? The other car definitely had 2 guys in it cause I saw them when we got picked up. My total fare was less than 40$ and both stops were safe neighborhoods.

Edit: thanks everyone for helping out. I’ll post an update if something is worth it besides a Lyft coupon. Either way keep your eyes open if your relying on someone u don’t know or trust.","Never heard anything like this. I’d report it That's bizarre, we're not making much as it is, he's basically paying twice as much gas and I'm assuming giving whoever is in the other car a cut. I'd report him, something just doesn't seem right. Yes, whatever their intension it's very stupid. Deserve to be reported. But Lyft can't prove anything.

It could be innocent. They may be buddy drivers who want to learn to navigate. Homies going somewhere together after the trip. If it's nasty, I would follow your car instead of leading.

Did everything check out? License plate, driver's name and picture? Can you see the driver operating the app? Did he have time to send the destination out to the other car?

For some reason, your driver cannot navigate so he had to follow.

The driver's app is in the car in front.

Your driver's app was mirrored in the front car. It is trivial to do but why?

So many possibilities. None makes sense. Driver name and license plate is in the app. File a police report and explain what is going on. You want to make sure the info is available in case anything happens.

When you call Lyft, inform them that a driver provided your personal information to another individual not associated with Lyft. That should get you a quick response since it’s potentially a legal issue.

Leave all your lights on for a few nights. That should help deter any home intrusions.

People are dumb... there are tons of dumb reasons someone might set the destination and have a friend follow them...

It’s possible the guy was heading somewhere with friends and set the destination to make money on the way (like they were all headed home after going out). 

He had driven out to jump a friends car, then set the destination home. His friend followed him to hang out and thank him for the help?

He was dropping his car off and heading out with the friend (or vice versa)

Literally tons of reasons... NONE that should have happened in a professional setting. It all comes down to the driver sharing your personal information with another individual. If the other car was leading, the driver prob sent them a screen shot of the app with your address displayed. I'd report that to the police. That's creepy af. [deleted] Flag him with a one star and report it in the comment section. Lyft will get back to you on it. I had a passenger leave gum on a window and my phone autocorrected to gun and Lyft emailed me almost immediately about it. This is a huge invasion of privacy. No one other the driver should *ever* know the passengers destination. If you were a single female, I would have been very suspicious. Get that creep off the road and maybe contact police and give them plate numbers. No way is this ok, no matter their intentions. security car my ass. scouting to rob you."
"22.5 hours of working and still can’t even cover my express drive rental since Lyft decided to take away all bonuses, tiers and promos. This is modern day slavery.",34,18.59252190057878,Lyft,Image,"Return the rental. You're wasting your time and money. Honestly the only way it makes sense to do Lyft or Uber is to own a cheap used, gas efficient sedan and just run it into the ground with miles. Rental cars or large cars with low mpg won't make you enough money. quit, its not worth it Modern day slavery? 

Are you in chains? Are you being beaten? Are you starving? Will you get shot if you don’t work? Don’t like what lyft is paying you, idk go get an actual job! All the apologists come running, but this is absolutely predatory. Hertz makes money, Lyft makes money, you're in the hole. You have to commit to the week before you even have a chance to gauge what kind of earnings are possible. How is it anything but a sham?

Take a hike, never come back. You missed the gravy train on gig work, it gasped its last about a year ago. I'm no pro or anything, but I think you need to learn your market better...like what day/time is most profitable. I only drive one day a week and do pretty well. Then again, I drive an electric vehicle so I don't pay for gas and I only do Lux/Black. That's why I quit, fuuuck it. [removed] Shame on them but I believe in Karma.  They’re days are coming.

I literarily got my first PPZ didn’t even know wtf was happening it was giving me so many notifications. All them fancy colors for 2.30$ shame on Lyft,9,18.592753382060263,Lyft,Image,"They make you feel like your playing a slot machine. With all the bright colors and sounds for a couple of dollars. Stop playing games, Lyft. And just give us the fucking bonus! What pisses me off most about PPZ is that it starts with a lower bonus, not the ""maximum"" bonus and if you get a ride before the gradual increase reaches the maximum bonus, then you only get that amount. If you decline the ride, the PPZ resets to the lowest amount for that zone. It's bullshit. I stick with Uber for the surges. I had one today while working the UGA game that was like 1.85 PPZ and then looked at Uber which was offering almost 6.00 surge.... And to top it off that PPZ disappeared quick and it went back to 3 dollar minimum ride while Uber was averaging close to 10 bucks.  It's really pathetic any way you look at it. Well i am permanently deactivated of uber cause of false allegations of one dumb rider and uber investigator was retarded as well she didn’t even see my dash cam footage and dropped the ban hammer They try to use psychology on us and try to convince us that $2.30 is so exciting and we should be jumping for joy.

What are Lyft's 14 new safety features?,6,18.738621437626854,Lyft,"In [recent news](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lyft-assault-victim-alison-turkos-sues-lyft-after-alleged-kidnapping-rape-cbs-this-morning-interview/), Lyft's response mentioned that they've launched 14 new safety features this year alone.

I've been unable to find a comprehensive list of what those features are. Gathered so far:
* continuous background monitoring
* in-app 911 emergency assistance
* enhanced identify verification
* increased in-app license plate visibility
* mandatory secondary feedback (<=3 stars)
* remove driver from re-matching if rated <=3 stars
* sexual harassment prevention education with RAINN
* increased anti-fraud measures (selfie)

Any idea what the other 6 are?

AFAIK location/route sharing, the color-coded Amp, 24/7 Trust & Safety team, and license/photo verification have been around before 2019. Smart trip check-in is launching later this year.

Just got Hired as a Community Associate,10,19.104628382096134,Lyft,"Hi /r/Lyft

This is a throw away account because I'm paranoid.

The interview process was quite long since Lyft is not fully established yet(PS this is in Vancouver), I had a tour of the office and met faces that I'd be working with and the overall impression I got was that It seems like It's going to be a great place to work. I have been lurking in the subreddit reading about peoples impressions and checking out glass door to see other peoples experience and impression and there's been more negative thoughts than I'd like to see. Is it really that BAD? Could it just be a case of people wanting to complain about their job, every work place has something shitty about it?  Things people have said have started to put me off.

Is it true the CA's are Salary and not hourly so they can use you for OT and not have to pay you any OT?

Thanks,","They can call you salary all they want.  However, unless you have schedule flexibility you still qualify as an hourly. The reviews on glassdoor are mostly drivers. Not actual employees. All the CA’s I know are hourly, not salaries... Former Community Associate here AMA. I was hourly, dunno if they changed it. I did have overtime but it was never more than an hour or so once or twice a week. I enjoyed the role, I was just a little lonely at times. Also some drivers can be a little depressing (one admitted he was living/sleeping in his rented car and clearly had a heroin addiction).

Overall I enjoyed it, everyone is nice and the colleagues were cool. No advice here, but good luck!! Ignore the negativity from the haters and formulate your own opinion.  I hope it works out for you. You are only exempt from overtime as an employee if you are an executive, manager, or professional. That’s according to the Fair Labor and Standards Act. So unless they are paying you a professional wage, they’d be hard pressed to argue for an exemption in court. You’re hourly and they’ll have to pay you for any ovetime. They should also be paying you a mileage reimbursement if you have to drive to meet people. Not sure about CA rules, but national DOL rules are

Must be paid more than $455 a week, 

Fit a set of work functions that are listed at dol website, your title is not enough. Usually they are manager positions with more than x of direct reports or sales that are well compensated employees, and professionals in the term of a doctor or lawyer or cpa functioning as a fiduciary of the company. 

Even if all that is met, if your job requires you to be there a crazy amount of time, they still have to meet minimum wage with overtime rules.  Let’s say you worked 100 hours a week, 

7.25 X 40 = $290 

10.86 X 60 = $651

290+651 = $941 week. What does a Community Associate do?"

How to let a driver for my scheduled ride know I might be a little late getting out of work at night?,12,19.572336715440507,Lyft,"Hi everyone! 

So I get done with work at 9pm, and I usually get out of work around 9:05, but it’s not a guaranteed thing (I work at a library and sometimes our closing procedures take a couple minutes longer). Usually I order a ride as I’m gathering my things, clocking out, all that. A ride usually takes 8-10 minutes to show up , and then I have to wait. Which I don’t mint, but a coworker waits with me, because it’s night. 

I’m scheduling a ride between 9:05-9:15 for next Friday , because I’m hoping that scheduling one means I won’t have to wait as long, and, more important, then a coworker won’t have to wait with me. 

I’ve never done a scheduled ride from this location before, but if the ride shows up at 9:05 and I’m not out of work yet, could I message the driver and let them know I’ll be out ASAP? (Due to security reasons I wouldn’t be allowed to leave until everyone is ready so we all walk out of the building together.) 

Of course, the ride could show up at 9:15 and I would have nothing to worry about, but I’m planning for the “worst case scenario.” 

Thank you!","I wouldn't schedule a ride in your situation the cancellation fee is doubled  to $10 if you miss it. You can message the driver but not every driver would wait for you. I would wait until everyone is done wrapping up and once you see everyone start moving for the exit order your lyft right then. You'll probably spend 5 mins exiting the building and saying goodbyes by which time your lyft would be almost there. I agree about not scheduling. Is your market so under saturated that the wait would be unbearably long? Text them when they arrive “be right out, finding purse (keys etc)” and tip your driver like crazy for being patient. Don’t accept a scheduled pickup you can’t show

 Drivers are paid $0.1275 / minute. Meaning even going 10 minutes out of their way doesn’t even net $1.50... a minimum ride is $2.62. All these prices are in the LA market.

I wanna make sure that your driver is being insane and you’re not just being hypersensitive.

When I stop into a lyft center and see no less than 10 employees sitting on their ass doing nothing or chit chatting with each other it makes me sick. That's where all our paycuts are going. This is how they are making back all the money they lost. Sorry but they aren't showing you the surge, it is a secret layer under that is hidden.  You can see this primetime layer that lyft uses to pay itself th money if you uninstall the app and re-install it.  I just posted a screenshot of the secret primetime that Lyft shows to customers, Lyft is still feeding on primetime.  You just don't know it but customer does. How is it the busiest week of the year? Drive to the surge and cancel. Hack the system Two words. Fuck Lyft!! Ya, I've been lyft only for a year and a half, time to sign up for uber. I cut mine off and just ran uber all night from the fairgrounds and only took XL rides made $300 in like 4 hours What does this have to do with surge? This is just a visual depiction of the hourly demand graph. You dont look at the graph when it spikes at 11pm and go ""OMG WHERE IS THE SURGE!!!"" do you? Demand and surge are indirectly correlated, one does not equal the other. $50 on Uber. You must be a new driver!! Sadly That won’t last!!!"
Anyone else only getting 2 destination filters?,13,19.99137606733927,Lyft,"Starting this week, my destination filters went from 6 to 2? 

I showed my cousin and he had 6 filters still.","I'm in Portland Oregon, still have six Yeah, they cut it down to 2 a while ago in my area. Probably a slow roll-out. Same in Denver, suddenly just 2 destinations. Fucking sucks because I've had it take me out of driver mode on my way home twice now when I was still 15+ miles away and driving though a dense part of town. I’m only getting two now as well. Yes I have only 2 as well and its been this way for a couple of weeks now. Meanwhile my wife is still at 6. We're in Austin, Texas. I contacted Lyft support and they claimed that its a technical issue affecting some drivers (FYI I have an Android device while my wife uses Apple). 

Personally I'm a bit skeptical about it being just a technical issue. I think perhaps they're contemplating making a change but wanted to live test it first without formally announcing it to see how it goes. That being the case for those of you wanting to keep it at 6 you might want to voice your displeasure lest Lyft assume no one cares and makes this change permanent."
New Lyft Driver,10,20.016075141413346,Lyft,"So I just started driving for Lyft last Sunday and am currently on 31 trips. It's pretty cool, but the problem I'm seeing is that I'm just not making any money. Of the 31 trips only 3 or 4 of them have paid me more than $3.75 which is the minimum amount that Lyft can pay me. Every ride is going less than 2 miles so Lyft ends up making about 65% and I make the remaining 35%. The new driver guarantee will actually help by almost doubling my money after 50 rides, but once that's over then I'll actually be making less than $4 per ride twice or less an hour. Will there be any ""Quest"" like things or weekly goals I can use that will increase my wages after this 50 ride guarantee or should I find another job","Honestly some of the best advice I got from other drivers and on this sub. Pick and chose your rides, I personally don't accept any rides further than ten minutes because it most likely will end up being a $3 ride. Also keep both apps on(Lyft/Uber) to maximize your potential

Also you gotta learn your market my first two or three weeks were really stressful I wasn't making much until I learned where and when in my city.  If this gig is for more than just a side few dollars you should find another job You’ll find what works for you. Reddit is full of grumpy people that know better. Things will ebb and flow. I personally take absolutely every ride no matter what. If I get taken way out of my way I just roll with the app on back towards whatever region I desire. Yesterday I grossed $200 for 10 hours. I’m usually between 180 and 220.  For some markets that’s horrible for others that’s amazing. For me I accept that it’s mediocre pay for a flexible gig I can turn on or off whenever I want. 

I only rate people 5 if I rate them at all. I use my people skills and sometimes people tip. The airport has been both a goldmine and a joke. I don’t drive drunk passengers so I avoid driving after 7pm. I might be screwing myself but I also haven’t had to clean up puke. College towns are rough. Lots of pax, none tip and a higher percentage of pukers. Worked a Saturday night in Iowa City once, 25 rides in 4 hours and made $100. Maybe $5-6 in tips ($2.55 minimum fares!)It was crazy busy but I think I would need to double that earning amount to do it again. Lyft can kiss my ass. They don't pay for long distance pickup (any distance, really). It says 5 mins, that's 5 mins of your gas. Fuck that. When I get a 1/2 mi Ping from Lyft, I tell the pax to switch to Uber. 1/2 milers are the only Lyft rides I respond to; and it's just to diss the service. Hmm. 

What market are you in? I am in a major city and make very, very good money. But I know that Lyft drivers in suburban areas outside of the city make nothing. It’s a drastic difference. If you aren’t in a larger area/tourist area, then yes you may need to reconsider something else after you get your new driver bonus. 

To answer your last question, yes! There are some bonuses sprinkled in randomly to your week. Such as ‘Complete 30 rides in a week and we will give you an extra $30’. It’s a nice little addon to my normal work week. But those only happen about twice a month. Get the bonus and get out.  It is getting worse every month.  Lyft is starting to lower the per mile rate to as low as 30 cents.  There is no future in this.  Get out while you can."

The Ping shows them as 5.0 but when I look at their profile after the accept, it says they are “New”.  So today I had two riders in a row like that and I asked them both if they were new to a Lyft. They both laughed and said they have been using the service for years. I wonder what’s up.","People create new accounts by using multiple methods for discounts. Can't say that I blame them at times. different phone and new email means new account especially if they are offering incentives to pax to ride.

Is it rude or out of line as a passenger to ask to roll the windows up and have the air conditioning turned on?,12,20.98899180808829,Lyft,"It's in the 80's Fahrenheit here and humid.  When I got in the car the windows were down. The trip is about a half hour on the freeway. I was hot and didn't want the wind blowing on me.  Was it ok for me to request the air conditioning be turned on vs. having the windows down?

Edit: update:  I asked nicely, he complied. 5 stars + tip. Although I've always given 5 stars + tip.","Nah, you're good.  Just ask the driver nicely.  If the driver is that cheap (even though I believe it's been proven that on the freeway, you get better efficiency with AC on rather than windows down), then that driver deserves a bad rating (this is coming from a driver).  A driver shouldn't be driving pax around if they don't have working AC, it's just bad business TBH. We're really at the point where asking for something is difficult or questionable.

No, don't. Leave a poor rating and a comment that just says ""no A/C"" like one guy did. Or just reach up and start messing with buttons like someone else. You could try just whining about it being so hot the entire time until they get the hint.


Yes, freaking politely ask. It's not rude. Driver should have asked your preference. If I ever want to have windows down as a driver I always ask passangers what they prefer (only applies to sunny pleasant days in the 70s) otherwise it's always windows up with AC. I don't see why not. You're paying for a service and to be comfortable. I hate driving with open windows in high humidity cause then I start feeling sticky. Yeah I always ask for stuff. “Can I put sunshade down? Can we turn AC up/down? Can I roll the window up?” No one has ever said no. You should be comfortable and ask for stuff, within reason. Most passengers don't speak up if they're uncomfortable. I typically have to fish for intel. It's quite expected for passengers to have / state a preference concerning temperature. I wouldn't be offended. I always ask riders if they want me to let them choose music, change the temperature or switch to windows, or if they wanted heated seats when it's rainy or cold at the start of the ride. i roll up to every drive w/ my windows down then ask them if they want them up or not.

thing is, there are some driver's here in this sub who would complain about you asking If these companies paid their drivers better, ac wouldn't be a problem."
Manual pickup,3,21.108436252546532,Lyft,"Hi, I’m new to Lyft and I had an issue pop up.  Lyft customer service was no help.

I often have someone request a ride in a building then walk out front to wait for me to get there. This leaves a pin drop on my screen and another “person” icon showing where the pax is.

I get them in the car but the app thinks I’m not there yet so I can’t start the run. I end up driving them around the parking lot till it registers.

Is there no manual pick up button? Uber has it , am I missing it?
Thanks","exit navigation.  i think its in the upper right.  then you are presented with the built in navigation for lyft with your pick up options

same applies to drop offs. Push “exit”.   On my app it’s in the bottom right.  

All “exit” does is exit the navigation mode.   Then you can do the next steps: arrive, confirm arrival, pick up. 

This was not clear to me at first.  I have made too many passengers drive around the block or through suburban parking lots with me to get to the pin after they have entered the vehicle.  :) I had this problem for a few days because I am a new driver, but if you hit the little x at the bottom right of the screen on the map gps it will exit out of it and let you pick up or drop off manually"

I know we all get on here because we're frustrated, but I am in a serious hole because I lost my job and Lyft deactivated  account because of a car accident last month.  I get all the notifications that my approvals have gone through, but within the app, I'm still deactivated for ""missing vehicle"" and on the website, it just says pending.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I have 11 days to make rent and I live in San Diego, so it's not like my rent is cheap.  I've sent numerous emails and have received no response, just that they've received my email and will review it.  Freaking out over here.

Edit: took the advice from a few of you and went to a hub. Apparently I never received the email to send them pictures of my vehicle to go over body damage. So that’s what was missing, but there was ZERO information available for that kind of issue.

Tell us more about that. Were you at fault? Injuries? Are the repairs completed? That may be your issue. Go to a hub!

I know this won’t help immediately, but you Might want to sign up for some additional ride share and maybe DoorDash if this ever happens again in the future Technically yes, I was at fault. But my insurance approved everything and my car was repaired and Lyft Claims reached out to me to tell me the next steps. I had no injuries and no passengers in my car. My car insurance is updated and valid through April 2020, and I passed the vehicle inspection. I just need to know if I’m ever going to be able to drive again, and if not, it’d be really cool if they could at least tell me."
I hate to say it but...,39,21.13795014144646,Lyft,"Without tips, at least in Houston, we don't make enough. I'm pretty sure that's the case for most places. If you can leave a $2-$10 tip, please do. $2-3 for short rides. $4-5 for medium. $6-10 for long. That's if you want to be a decent person. If not, I'm not here to tell you what to do. This is for those who want to know if they should tip and how much. Specifically in Houston, taking regular Lyft.","I agree, but Lyft and Uber need to raise the passengers fee just below cab rates.  Minimum $10 fare should be for drivers. Or Lyft could pay their drivers better instead of it being completely up to the customer to make it a semi-livable wage. Don't worry, they take part of your tips too:

My husband had a passenger the other day who had him end the ride while he was in the car and they tipped him $20 (they showed him the phone jokingly saying, ""don't let them jack it!!"")... the tip didn't show up for 2 hours and it was only $15.03

🤦‍♀️ Definitely not worth it without tips. Yeah I still cannot believe that there's no minimum. I drove somebody yesterday and it was two bucks and they put a boost of a few cents for a minimum guarantee to give you $2.5,
I just don't understand how there was ever a concept of a ride not being 5 bucks even if they were standing in front of you, the risk of letting them in your car and dealing with them and operating a business for $2 is just unbelievable, but to have to drive several miles to get them and deal with whatever hassles come up like location problems and traffic and get $2 on a ride that might have even canceled before you pick them up
.. this is beyond me. 
they wouldn't need all these different stupid incentive programs if they just paid right in the first place, but that shows the kind of drivers that they are choosing to hire. they have to game everybody and pretend it's like a slot machine to get the drivers to do anything. 
I would way rather work for decent pay, work hard earn a ton of money. 
I have no interest in any bonuses, ride minimums percentage, everything else.. 
it's because I have to jump through so many Hoops that I won't go full time on this like a few of the people do that make good money. 
I'm not interested in this job being a 9 to 5. 
I don't want to have to do a hundred and forty-one rides to get a certain pay rate, so they're just causing their own problem. they're like the government taxing you too much then saying you're broke and then offering you food stamps as incentive instead of taking all of our money away up front, pay us decent and offer less cash and prizes on the back end if we jump to the right hoops at the right time of day in the right area. I drive a 5.7 Hemi @ 69 cents/mile. Tips help. 31% of my gross goes towards fuel. 41% tip, which has been a rock solid figure over 2 months. If anyone is driving for 32c/mile or lower and doesn't have a hybrid... man... 

Lyft is on a fast track to bankruptcy. Hertz ain't gonna save 'em. Here's the irony.  Uber cfo and CEO make about 45 million a year and haven't made a profit.

General Motors has employees on strike company made 6 billion in profit and CEO makes 20 million a year.

That's your silicon valley venture capital wisdom. Don’t be silly Lyft charges the customer twice your fare. They already paid too much. Your $7 payout cost your customer $15 or more. what is considered short/medium/long? I use ride-sharing quite a bit. But I am on a fixed income, Social Security disability and usually am traveling to a doctor's appointment or grocery store. Many times I honestly cannot afford to tip, or if I do, it's not much. If too many drivers down-vote me, there will be no drivers left. Ride-sharing companies provide a vital service for the disabled. I would hate to lose my ability to get around town because I am poor. Everyone can afford to at least tip a buck...c'mon. no matter how long the ride is. Not sure about Houston but without tips, adjusted for cost of gas I still make an average of 20/hr with 30/hr not at all uncommon on weekends and days where big events take place. I live in a big ten college town. And I hate to say it but...

These ride sharing platforms aren't intended to deliver a live-able wage.

It's kinda like recycling aluminum cans & being pissed off the company isn't paying more per can. I would make sure that the you’re downrating passengers who don’t tip. You won’t change habits but you can change who you drive. 

Then again if ALL of us did this, it would change habits"

I’m pretty frustrated.,"Dont wait for Lyft to magically take care of this because they most likely wont. If this was charged on Paypal through another bank or just Paypal, print up your statement with every single charge and note the claim status of each one. You can absolutely dispute every individual charge and you have i believe 6 months to do it so dont let anyone tell you otherwise. No company wants to admit its IT is vulnerable and reversing charges does not benefit them financially especially when its fraud. Also note that Paypal has fraud protection built into their user agreement so it might take sometime and you might have to provide some documentation to prove it wasn't you, but Lyft has a history of this bullshit. Eek. Chicago has a direct number / any major metro can push you to the customer service right away. the fraud team is slow to respond. Like others have said, just dispute with your bank and wait for Lyft to respond. If your account was hacked that should make the news.

Car seat question,20,21.221526530346384,Lyft,"Im a new driver in Mass and have recently had a few PAX come in the cart with baby's in carriers. I pushed back and they said people do it all the time for them. So I accepted, feeling the whole time I shouldn't have and after reading other posts here I won't again. 

My question is even with a baby carrier,  they still need a base to click into to be legal,  correct? One mom held onto the carrier,  and one used the buckle through the carrier somehow. I'm pretty sure they need a base that's secured with a seat belt to be legal. Is this correct,  and do you handle in the same way?","If they are the infant style car seats they can be used without the base but the seat belt needs to be properly routed through to hold it in place. Holding it is definitely not safe.  I think there are some that don’t have a base, especially for slightly older babies?  I hope so or I’ve been falling for it. Most of the detachable seats can be secured without the base with just the seat belt. Baby seats must be belted in no matter what, never allow anyone to just hold onto the carrier. Most car seats can be safely attached with a seatbelt (not all cars have anchors).

The strap goes  through car seat, and is clicked in.

Then slowly pull seatbelt all the way out until it retracts and is taut - this last part is what people often miss.

Infants must face backwards in back seat. If you're talking about [this](https://www.nordbaby.com/lv/en/car-seats/baby-carriers/joie-i-level-i-size-baby-carrier-with-isofix-base-granit-bleu_112214) kind of carrier, then, yes it needs to have a base.

Deny anyone insisting on not having an actual car seat for a child under 8 (not sure what age is required to have a seat in your area, but it's 8 yo or 50lbs where I live) or a base system for a baby. No car sear, no ride. Driver here with a baby:

You don't need a base basically the carriers, most if not all, are meant to be strapped with the seat belt. What is not cool is to have it on their lap. Lookup your state laws on child restraints. You are responsible. Aside from the law, what about when a small survivable accident results in a dead baby?

These people should be denied the ride, lectured/shamed about their child's safety and reported to DCFS. How about you just worry about driving the car"

Tips in Lyft driving are substantially lower than tips in food delivery like Uber and Door Dash. In Lyft I get $26ish in tips for $238.

I think Lyft who get Lyft Munch or something similar to LyftEats. Generally you’re right.  That said, the delivery payouts per hour are often lower for delivery than rideshare.  I think a better comparison might be tips/hour. Or, better yet, overall pay/hour. It’s mainly since RidePass was released which basically makes us a means of Public Transit. This is the business model Lyft seem to be pursuing. If your acceptance rate is over 50% you’re on Lyft too much and are hurting your earnings. It’s better to keep Lyft at about 30% Uber at about 50%+ and Food Delivery 20% Lyft is easier and less degrading. Also, doesn’t lyft and Uber advise customers that tips are not expected by drivers or some shit? I love camping by the college McDonald’s at night. Stoners!!! Motel tweakers! Whoooo!!!

Rating etiquette for non-tippers,50,22.07499875260448,Lyft,"I’m sure this may be mundane as the subject has probably been beaten to death but as I’m new to Lyft and new to reddit, I’m curious what your etiquette might be for passengers who don’t tip. I’ve kept everyone at 5 stars as of now, with one strong exception, and I’m wondering if I should only base ratings on passenger quality and not necessarily tipping. If I also base it on tips, I do not want to go 1-2 stars if they were a good passenger, but does 3-4 stars do anything to help me as a driver, as well as other drivers?

I’ve done hours of research to learn all I can about different aspects, including within this subreddit, and I thank you all for your input and guidance both in the past and future. I’ll continue to check in often.","My personal strategy is 4-star anyone and everyone who doesn't tip, 3-star anyone who was rude/needy/smelly etc. enough that I don't want to give them a ride in the future. If you see a ping from someone that has a 4.9, they likely (but not always) don't tip.

I used to give everyone 5-stars, but then realized I wasn't doing myself or other drivers any favors by not indicating who may tip. Because I drive primarily for Uber, and we have to rate immediately after the ride, I only rate based on the experience. When I used to drive for Lyft there was a short period of time that I would wait until the end of my shift to see if someone tipped. If they didn't I would give them a 4 star. However, I stopped doing that. I feel like Uber and Lyft should do more to pay drivers better, like actually increasing the price of the rides and giving that to us. If you handle luggage,  groceries,  have a charger ready or make an impromptu stop and they don't tip,  hard 1 star. If I gave everyone who didn’t tip a bad rating I wouldn’t get any pings 😭😭😭😭....I only rate if it’s someone I don’t want to pick up again because they were rude or smelled bad. I feel like whenever I start down rating people with Lyft my rating magically starts decreasing as well.  Like, I haven't rated anyone in two weeks & my rating has been a steady 5 stars - if I start rating people tonight, my rating will also start decreasing... test it yourself, but I've tested it many times & I've never seen different results. If I find out a pax is in ANY service industry job and doesn't tip at least $1, it's automatic 3 stars. We all need to stick together. I never stiff a barber or a server. Don't tip?  I don't want to see you again.  So, 3 stars. 4* for non tippers. Unless they live in a good driving area, non tippers get 3 stars so I don’t accidentally get them again. 

On College campuses, be liberal with the 3 stars and suspicious of anyone with a 4.9. They’re all new pax and can be terrible. College students sometimes report drivers just to get a free ride. They also risk YOUR license by having open alcohol, too many people for car size. They also puke a lot... oh college. No tippers want 1 stars. Don’t deny them what they desire. A word of caution on your strategy. Tips can come in minutes, hours or even days later. I, personally, don't rate negatively based on tips for this very reason. i 5 star everyone because i dont care and just want to move onto the next screen and take another ride Who cares, Just drive. 

I have never bothered to rate anyone ever. Especially over a lack of tip, that seems so trivial. 

Also the majority of these people are taking Lyft everyday. You can't expect a tip from them, unless maybe you provided an exceptional experience. 



. I think giving someone a low rating just because they didn't tip - is a bitch move. TIL as a rider I should rate the the driver 4 stars when I don’t leave a tip, okay."
Is There Value with Business Limos? Weigh In.,10,22.154558937800704,Lyft,"Do you think there is value in using a limo for business purposes outside of rideshare? What do you think?

[**https://djslimo.com/newark-nj-airport-business-limo-near-me/**](https://djslimo.com/newark-nj-airport-business-limo-near-me/)","I don't think there is value. First of all, I am utterly shocked and amazed at how many people who could easily afford a LUX, LUX Black or LUX XL ride choose my crappy Nissan Versa. I've given rides to business execs in three piece suits with brief cases and Rolex's. I've given rides to young wunderkinds to their $10,000 bottle service tables at the clubs (and back).   


I pick people up at Luxury hotels, four star rated restaurants, premiere night clubs, exclusive membership only golf courses, gated luxury communities with armed guards, you name it.   


I just don't see how the companies that own these vehicles make money, maybe if you have a fleet of them, without too much competition, have exclusive contracts with a variety of venues, and hustle your ass off, you might break even? I dunno. It's a huge risk that's for sure. Some people like them. They’re a huge pain in the ass to turn on city streets with. My old company arranged limo services all the time when customers were visiting the office or touring our facilities, as part of making a good impression on them, but employees mostly had to use UberX or vanilla Lyft. It depends of the ciry. Rich metropolis like New York,  LA, Seattle could work . Weigh in. Modified vehicles (re: stretched limos) are not allowed on Uber or Lyft AFAIK. I wouldn't do it personally. I can't remember the last time I've seen a limo.

And I was in a wedding 2 weeks ago. Good feedback so far. I think the market for business limo use is strong but the client company for the limo has to evaluate what advantages they expect to receive. Is it an improved image, better business relationships, goodwill? Or will the business limo client just take these added benefits for granted?"
New to Lyft,19,22.160334400763666,Lyft,"Hello, I’m looking to start driving for Lyft. I’m already approved and ready to go just haven’t taken a ride yet. I do have a newer car that I’m willing to run into the ground as it is mostly paid off and SUPER low miles around 11,000. 

Do I have to display the stickers in the window? Or is identifying the vehicle good enough for someone to know that is their driver?

How far is best to go to pickup a pax? I have heard around 5 mins and other times I’ve heard up to around 10-12 mins can be fine. 

My car is pretty solid on gas it’s a 2016 Malibu 1.5T. Like I said this is a vehicle I am comfortable putting miles on. 

Before anyone says it I do believe in my market it can be do able full time, I have someone who makes around $700-$1000 weekly without really doing more than 40 hours. He does not take into account of gas cost, washes, oil changes etc because nobody thinks about that for a job commute and he has grown up bills to pay and he is doing just fine. 

Anything I may be missing?","Rideshare insurance from your insurance company must get Dashcam Be aware 5 minutes on hwy is further away so be avoiding staying near hwy Don’t give pax water or treats Your ratings don’t matter You could right now go sell your car for $13,000. Just make sure to work in depreciation into your earnings so you don't come out thinking your making $30/hr. That car will be about worthless in 2 years. Just get excited, you’ll find your niche. Make a little joke about picking up strangers from the internet. They eat it up, the more you tell it the more tips you’ll get. 

Expect nothing, deliver excellence. Everyone will burn out. 

Every passenger I’ve given water, an apple, or gum to hasn’t tipped. 

The usual stereotypes about who tips and who doesn’t are true and offensive so just expect it and roll with it. 

Go out right now and pick up a passenger. I was nervous and did a trial run for a few hours and made $100 driving around town. Treat every drive as a business expense from the moment you are pinged and start driving to the pax. Log ALL of your miles, save every receipt and file them daily. I recommend logging you miles on a driver app like Turbo Taxes quickbooks that will feed directly into your account. Don't do it!  The pay keeps decreasing and the policies get more unfriendly every month.  The amount of drivers out nearly doubles every year.  This means your profit is ALWAYS falling!

Don't depreciate your car!  Get a real part time job somewhere instead. Get a front and cabin facing dash-cam. I took everyone’s advice on here and got one. It saved my ass last week. I was attacked by my pax, and she swore I was making it up. If not for the video/audio proof, shit would of got bad real quick. 1 star non-tippers"
Signing up for Express Drive after September 9th 2019,13,22.1692464378145,Lyft,"I had been contemplating signing up for express drive for a few weeks. Finally, when I had enough money for the $250 deposit I made a reservation for the Lyft rental car. Turns out I was a few days too late and now I am no longer eligible to receive the rental rewards bonus and am stuck paying the $250 week rental fee until Lyft decides to issue express rewards in my region. 

I am beyond annoyed. 

The employees at the hertz/Lyft location didn’t even inform me of this until AFTER I signed and got the keys. I feel jaded about this whole experience. I could’ve just kept using my own car! 

If they don’t issue rewards in my region in the next two weeks then I’m going to return the car. Oh, and it can take up to two weeks to get my deposit back. Great. 

I’m wondering from other express drivers will this even be worth it? Even IF they issue express drive bonuses in my area. I drive full time by the way.","It’s not worth it. This rental program is designed for those desperate for a vehicle. If there is any possible way to return the car immediately and get your money back you absolutely should.  In fact if you say you have another car that qualifies you should use that no matter what.  The chance of Lyft bringing back those rewards in the next two weeks is almost zero.  Being mislead and taken advantage of is only the beginning.  You would make more money using your own car just to do Uber eats and doordash then renting through hertz.  Please listen and return the car or find some other income before you lose even more. The rental reward is a week by week thing that should be prorated to so many rides per day of your first week.  If that is no longer in effect,  then they are scum sucking lowlives who manged to sink even lower. Get out. You do not seem to realize they pay you less per ride. Look at you rate card. What city is this in? Express Drive without Rental Rewards is nonsense. There are drivers nation wide that haven't seen a reward, bonus, challenge, or PPZ in over a year. Hoping for rental rewards? I wouldn't be surprised if they're completely phased out in the future. Lyft thus far has no intentions of doing drivers favors."

I literally started yesterday, and I’m already kind of regretting it. This is the problem - Lyft thinks they can live within the ""100 ride average"" & take a little more & a little less ride to ride - it's wrong & greedy.  The milage on my car does not fluctuate like that so I don't think my pay should either... My pay should only increase, never decrease - when I am faced with harsher weather conditions my  pay should increase, when there is heavy traffic my pay should increase.  I don't agree with a system that is playing off of demand or ""how many riders available"" because that doesn't affect the individual experience for anyone but Lyft as an app/robot/ai.  Their server has to work harder - but that's why they get a cut of every ride to maintain the robots & app.  That's the end of their participation but greed.

Why I’m Suing Lyft,14,22.661700141529245,Lyft,Image,"This sounds terrible and I hope it didn't happen. But I got to be honest I read the story and I don't believe it. Sounds to me like she called to complain about the excessive charge after she was dropped off, Lyft ignored her and this is her ""retaliatory complaint"".  I hope for the drivers sake he had a dash cam. If it turns out she is lying I hope she gets prosecuted. Fake allegations need to receive more than a slap on the wrist. I really do not understand this. When you are raped or sexually assaulted, call the police, not Lyft customer support. Was the driver charged with any crime? Is the driver in jail? There is so much information missing, I really do not understand the claim.

We want Lyft to protect drivers but then we have drivers hoping this passenger sues Lyft for every penny when the driver that gave the ride does not seem to have been charged with any crime by police. What is happening??? [deleted] Seriously, your first call after being assaulted/raped was to Lyft, not to the police? You're more concerned about being charged $12 than that a criminal is still out there driving people around?

Whatever the truth, the optics on that look bad. An 80 minute trip across state lines before finally getting to original destination only cost $12?

$12 is about a minimum fare at 1.0 prime time. If Lyft doesn’t care about its customers they certainly don’t care about their good drivers who don’t go raping people. I hope they get every penny because safety, equal or fair treatment,  cooperation, and common sense does not exist with Lyft (or Uber) when it comes to outrageous and criminal behavior. Ive reported and been reported on only to receive ""sorry for the inconvenience"" but of course nothing this serious."
Changing of Picking Up(Passenger),12,22.762278845243983,Lyft,"SO I truly wish LYFT would stop swapping my passengers as im halfway. If I know its about to be a big ride (40-60+ minutes when I know theirs no traffic) I dont want to randomly get it swapped by a 1-5 mile trip. its so aggravating how I look at it get excited and halfway their i get an instant change of passenger. Or when I accept the first trip and literally like 30 seconds later it gets AUTOSWAPPED and I get confused when i travel the same amount of time it was gonna take me to get that long trip for someone who only wants 1.5-2 miles.   


ALSO please make it so people that constantly get .5-2 mile trips PAY MORE. I personally HATE driving in LA because of this. whenever I get to LA i usually either turn it off or try my best to get a trip getting out of LA. i love driving for 1-2hours doing 1-3, 1-2 mile trips./s  


Also, please stop allowing adults to purchase rides for minors. I hate having to pick up a minor because I feel like if it was my KID i would want them to get picked up. (i report it after but nothing really ever done as ive picked up the same kid before). Especially in certain neighborhoods I just grab them and move on. Or if i already have 2 people in my car I dont want to waste their time to tell this kid I cant pick  them up.   


ALSO PLEASE MAKE RIDERS HAVE PROFILE PICTURES. how is it fair they know who tf I am but I cant know who they are. Its such an easier interaction when it comes to picking up someone with a profile picture because it makes all the quick BS questioning stop from begging. Its such an awkward moment when I see a name and then having to ask who the ride is for and they are puzzled.","I had a 45+ XL trip swapped for a Shared ride a few weeks ago.  I don't know where the Shared ride was going, because I cancelled it, but then support told me they ""always try"" to swap rides for similar or better rides with a closer pick up time -- which is entirely bullshit, because I have also been swapped on when I was right in front of the original passenger. I’ve never had a long trip swapped, that’d be pretty upsetting to be honest Although there is a $5 cancellation fee for someone hailing a ride for a minor, its not enough to discourage parents or adolescents with a credit card from trying This is one of the main reasons I no longer drive for Lyft. That and the garbage rates they rolled out in my market. ""Congratulations, you'll now get paid from the time you accept a ride! But we're cutting your per-mile rate IN HALF!

"Been driving Lyft exclusively for a year. Changes to destination filters, rates and seemingly lower demand has me considering signing up for Uber also. Is it worth it? Driving Portland, Oregon. Thx!",63,22.78915384524398,Lyft,,"Depends on the market.  I'm in Atlanta.  Haven't seen a ride bonus offered in almost a year.  I'm now about 90% Uber.  I do one or two Lyfts a month just to keep ""active.""  Every once in awhile they'll have a higher power zone than Uber.

&#x200B;

Lyft sold themselves as the company that treated drivers better.  And for a long time, they did.  But as the IPO approached, all that went away and they became the same as Uber.  To me, that was worse.  Uber was at least honest they were assholes.  Lyft played like the nice friend that then knifed me in the back.  

&#x200B;

DM me if you want an Uber referral code. I’m also in Portland. Been driving 1.5 months.  

Adding Uber gives you more pings. Uber also has more incentives than Lyft. (All I see for Lyft are random PPZs.).  That said, Uber also has a saturation of drivers at times, making those incentives sometimes unattainable (for me at least).   

Lyft riders tend to tip more frequently than Uber riders.  But some Uber riders tip more (because Uber has a percent system that’s used more than with Lyft).  But most Uber riders tip me 0.  

The worst passengers I have had are Uber.  But my worst passengers really haven’t been all that bad. Driver from Seattle.  Uber is better in most ways.  You’re increasing your downtime by only driving for one and therefore decreasevyour earnings by not driving on both unless one has amazing weekly rewards.  That doesn’t seem to be the case ever these days.  Use someone’s referral code.  I definitely could use the referral bonus.

Lyft treats drivers worse and Uber is cheaper for passengers but pays the same to us.  Also passengers tend to be business travelers more often. You should always be doing both You should immediately sign up for Uber Uber driver, Portland. The answer is yes. Some nights Lyft is dead and Uber will make your $. Some nights Uber will be dead and Lyft will make your $. As a Lyft only driver your competing with the Lyft rental program. Mon-thurs is sitting at the airport with 100+ cars. Those people are working 70+ hours to hit their rental bonus. Weekdays, get on Uber. Weekends, do what ever you like. I have noticed a huge decline in drivers between 3am and 6am. Keep both on. Just doing Uber now to see how it goes. I had 5k lyft rides now I’m an Uber rookie. Do it, you won’t regret it. I did 2200 rides exclusively for Lyft, after all their BS I tried Uber and have been somewhat happy with them. They offer better bonuses and you can get better promotions by being at Gold or higher level with them.

Does it have its issues, heck yes! But it’s still way better than Lyft. Currently at 4.98 with 1200 plus rides. I’m switching as well. Lyft is terrible, I’m sure Uber isn’t much better but it sure as hell cant be worse. I’m in Los Angeles and the traffic combined with pointless $2 “bonuses” makes everyday extremely disappointing. Passengers tips are the only way to make anything decent but even that is fairly unreliable. Sign up for everything. Lyft, Uber, Postmates, all the gigs. Look into courier companies, as well. If driving is your full time then it's best to maximize that time or at least have other options. I’m in Portland. Been driving for a month. First 2 weeks i only drove for Lyft. I was somewhat satisfied with what I did with Lyft but there was definitely sometimes I would spend 30 minutes waiting for rides. Then I added Uber and I am significantly busier with Uber. It’s like an 75/25 split. Uber seems to pay more. I might wait 15 minutes in between rides. I typically drive about 4am to 4pm.  Cheers! It's free to sign up. You have nothing to lose but the time it takes to sign up. I’m in LA  95% of my rides are Uber. Just made the switch to Uber and it’s working better for me in Chicago. Less hours more $$$ for now. My pay started slipping and I had to work longer to get the same goal daily. Also no matter how many tips I got I always average the same amount per hour. That part got to me I would get 18 tips on 23 rides and still average $20-$25 an hour. Then the next day I will get no tips 23 rides and average the same per hour something doesn’t add up, I get that maybe they have to pool tips so that we all make a fair wage but it just started to seem like a harder grind. I like Lyft more, always have, it just seems like a friendlier app, but if I could I would still run Uber primarily because even though Lyft is popular here, I have a friend who is making significantly more on Uber. Unfortunately uber deactivated me and after numerous attempts at finding out the official reason, no one could give me a straight answer. I would sue them if I knew how to. Another opportunity to make money.
Yes.
What's the worst that happens? You sign up and don't drive?

Even if you only turn it on when Lyft is dead for you,  it opens a door to added pay for you. I drive in DC, same issues here. I drive Via mostly now because of the surge rates and it doesn't take me out of the metropolitan area Both are terrible but Uber is less terrible Yes! 

I'm in PDX and have been driving both. Uber generally makes me more money but it REALLY depends on the day AND the time of day. Often Uber swamps me in the morning, and Lyft in the evening.

I always get re-matched at PDX airport on Uber, it's only happened once with Lyft. The tip ratio between platforms is no longer true since Lyft went public. I actually get tipped more with Uber now (I think because pax are constantly getting coupons for rides )

This past Saturday (which I don't normally work), I picked up a Unicorn on Uber. He wanted to go to VooDoo to get donuts for a friend he was visiting in Banks. Asked me if I would be willing to drive out there (sure! just add it to the app) then paid for parking by VooDoo, decided the line was too long so I suggested Blue Star. Drove him there, he bought 2 dozen donuts (a dozen freaking donuts for me), and ended up tipping me $170 in cash once we got to his friends house in Banks.

That will probably never happen again, but it was awesome. We should all shift to Uber.   If Lyft went under, then this whole industry could stabilize rates and payouts at a workable place No.  Do yourself a favor and get out of rideshare completely ASAP.  Uber will soon match LYft and start paying drivers 30 cents a mile.  I've been doing this for about three years and the amount or drivers has at least tripled.  It really sucks now and I haven't made over $100 in a day now in weeks. Pdx driver here, I don’t use the filters. Long story short Uber took 2 months and $40 to approve my profile.  

I’d say do it, some people don’t tip. Some days are slow, it helps make your time worthwhile. Lyft riders are generally more friendly. I get more self important phone yackers from Uber. They never tip. Lyft gives me more short rides from the should probably catch the bus crowd. They don’t tip either."
Lyft Allegedly Kept a Driver on the Platform Who Held a Passenger at Gunpoint While Two Other Men Raped Her,3,22.79621403042917,Lyft,Image,"Man, I read the article and this story makes no sense.

Look on FB for your local rideshare group. If you’re in a big enough area, they usually have one. It’ll help you navigate the local area, know where it’s busy.

There are also videos on YT that show ways to impress pax.

New drivers tend to get decent rides, so at least ride the initial wave until it starts sucking.

Critical cleaning:
Clean windows (honestly, best advice I ever got).

Vacuum daily

DONT spray strong smelling scents. Use new car smell or ozium.

Car wipes to remove dust.

Keep barf bags.

Critical services:

Have chargers (light up ones make pax very happy) - offer charge for phone on rides over 10 minutes.

Listen to top 40 in general, 80s for older people (35+). Program best rap, r&b, and npr... jic they request genre and you need a quick choice.

I offer waters for rides over 10 minutes. Carry small 6oz waters. People won’t finish large waters and will leave them. They generally take empty small water when dropped off (no idea why they always left big waters, but whatever...) ——FYI, a case of 80 small waters is $8 at Costco... prob a few dollars more at retail store. Still, it’s 10-15 cents to make people happy

Learn to set boundaries (seriously). 

If the pax stumbles to you or appears REALLY drunk, cancel and drive away. 

You WILL NOT  get the $150 from Lyft (for puking all over your car) without jumping through hoops and wasting your night. Most you’ll get with just pics is $25. Read the “ride needed cleaning” instructions clearly (click ride, then get help with this ride, damages, car required cleaning). Needs to be reported before next ride with clear pics. If you give another ride, you SOL. You’ll also need cleaning receipts to get more than $25... this is why you cancel on too drunk trashed people.

If the pax calls asking you to hurry, cancel. You don’t want to start out with a pissed off pax.

No smoking or vaping in car. Just tell pax that you can’t allow it but you’ll pull over and wait if they really need a smoke.

Follow GPS, but be open to directions if your comfortable with the area. Pax like it and it makes them feel safe, even if it’s a few minutes slower. It’s up to you.

No open alcohol. You get the ticket, NOT the pax.

I’m sure there’s more... if you don’t have anything to talk about, ask if they have pets. If they do, you’re set for whole ride.

Script:

Hello, I’m ____ here for _____

Just to confirm, the destination is ____

How are you today?

Would you like a water? (10+ minutes)

Need a charge? (10+ minutes)

Then you kick off the general discussion stuff...

This is a gigantic scam designed to enrich a select few. They don’t give a rats ass about drivers and will boot you from the platform with
zero qualms or interest in finding the truth if a PAX complains.

What's significant about it is that a fair amount of people are doing ride share without really knowing how their pay is calculated. This gives Lyft/Uber an upper hand in recruiting people who probably think I take rides and I pay this much, this driver is making bank keeping 75% or 80% of the fare like most riders believe. It also aids them in making changes to the pay structure/rates without much resistance.

It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to have a sticky post with how we are paid and with some history of how we used to get paid to help people understand where we are at and where we are trending towards. This would be super beneficial to new drivers, people considering doing this gig, even for passengers who have no clue drivers getting raked over the coals in the name of profitability and funding autonomous car research. Inb4 they pay you for time and distance. On average I see them take 40-60% on both services.

Sometimes passengers have discounts, hence the 20% ones pop up now and then.

I would not drive in So Cal.  We make $1.11/mile in Seattle and that's the only way it's worth it.  LA is on $0.60/mile last I heard, which is ridiculous.

They choose the price, they tell the PAX then they choose how much they will take from each ride without any regard for the person actually doing all the work.

Any Advice?? Lyft driver falsely accused of Assault,43,23.65072791936221,Lyft,"Hi,

Any advice would be most helpful for the following scenario

Last week I picked up a an unfriendly passenger at a hotel in DC as part of a shared ride.  She was the first passenger to get in, she mean mugged me and when I said ""Hi, how are you?""  twice, she didn't respond and looked the other way.  I had my radio of some podcast on real low volume - I almost never play things before people get in.  But the first thing she said to me was to turn my radio down so I turned it down to a whisper.

Then she got on her phone and started yelling and laughing super loud.   I picked up a second passenger and that passenger sat in the front seat and complained by facial expression and soft verbal statements of the noise the other passenger was making.   I then overheard the unfriendly passenger say on the phone ""my driver is a selfish asshole and plays the radio while I'm on the phone.""

 I completed the 2nd passengers ride.   Then I pulled over 2 blocks and explained to unfriendly and insolent passenger that I was uncomfortable completing her ride.  I said she can request a new ride and it would not cost her anymore.   She said I'm only doing that because 'shes black'.  I assured her that I do no discriminate but I didn't like to be disturbed by so much noise and called an asshole when I'm offering a helpful and comfortable service.  She proceeded to call 911...I said   
""ma'am this isn't a matter for 911..I'm asking you nicely to step out of my car""   She ignored me and refused to move.  

I then got out and walked to her door and opened it.   She then voluntarily left and muttered some racist or insolent comment about me and walked off.

That was last weekend. 

So I get an e-mail this friday saying my account is on hold while they investigate me.  

I call in to find out I was reported for making racist comments (I did none of that), and for Assalting her!!   I found out that this passenger has a history of making false accusations about drivers.  (THEN WHY IS SHE STILL A PASSENGER ON THE PLATFORM!?!?!?)  I have never done these things in my life and here I'm being accused of doing them on a job where I always act professionally.  

So I have called and called...they keep telling me to wait for a call for an agent to be assigned and resolve investigation.

Does anyone have any advice for me?  Because she accuses me of assault and I don't have any evidence to the contrary other than the other passenger noting her behavior...  

Any advice on how I can proceed aside from waiting? 

I'm worried Lyft will deactivate me because I cannot prove the truth.   Time for a dash cam no doubt?

\-Zack","Well, there’s always time for a dash cam!

Edit: Fuck, I’m surprised you don’t have a dash cam right now. [deleted] Go to your nearest hub and calmly explain what happened- if the passenger has a history of this they should reactivate you to drive on the spot.  Try and not let your frustration show when you go in- Lyft is customer-service oriented and expects drivers to be as well...   No matter how egregious pax behavior gets, I always put on a ""lightly amused yet gravely concerned"" tone of voice whenever I have to report pax to Lyft and they're much more supportive and sympathetic. Any time I have a passenger who was an exceptional asshat, I’ll 1 star and write what happened in the comments so that when the passenger reports me they’ll already have my side. I get reported all the time but they’ve never deactivated me for an investigation. 1. Do not depend on one platform. 
2. Invest in a front / rear dual dashcam. 
3. Get picky. If you get a red flag feeling, don’t start the ride. 
4.  Get a thicker skin. If you’re already on the road, might as well finish it out as quickly as you can. Unfortunately you have to be patient with their lame process.

Hindsight of course for not getting ahead of her and reporting her.

Explain just as you have here, she was rude, lied, etc. Why would the company continue to facilitate her making false accusations.

You can try calling a lawyer to see if you can sue her personally. Start the camera rolling before you pull over to end a ride or have one rolling at all times.  I dont end a ride until the passenger gets out anyway so you are free to record on your phone until they do. I know this is easy for me to say, but if this woman has a history of doing this, I don’t see why lyft won’t reactivate you. What’s also crazy is that this woman has a history of this behavior and is still on the platform. People keep telling you to get a dashcam, but Lyft will not accept the video, so it's worth it for a police criminal investigation, but not getting anything resolved with Lyft.  

Your situation had happened to me three times now.   
I have been accused by 3 passengers, calling them the N word.   One of these 3 said I attempted to choke her and drug her out of my car by her hair.   
Clearly, none of these claims were real.  
Overtime, you will find out that you must discriminate.  If you stop accepting shared rides altogether, alot of the garbage passengers will never be in your car.   
Most of my issues have been with 20 something women of a certain demographic.    You can probably figure that one out.   
I will no longer pick up this demographic.   I will never pick up in the hood.   If I accept a ride, based on the very limited information that Lyft provides and the passenger looks like one of my red flags, and is going to the hood, I just cancel the ride.   
Talking on speakerphone, being loud and rude, eating food, having babies with no car seats.....most of the usual problems occur with one single demographic. Dash cams are like $70 on amazon, you should already have one. Same thing happened to me on uber I told the rider I do not want to go across province for her destination and cancelled the ride and she wont be charged and she started calling me an asshole and that she will report me, I was confident nothing would come of it since I had dash cam, well guess what the bastards at uber bought her story that I assaulted her even after watching my dash cam footage and I was permanently deactivated. I am pretty sure Lyft will not reactivate your account. https://youtu.be/pXRiVE3Cot4. Dash cam footage of uber Passenger that got my account fully deactivated by false allegations saying I spat in her face uber fully viewed the footage and deactivated me Update everyone,

The higher department finally reached out to me and I finally got reactivated after 10 days of deactivation.   Now to get the dash cam and remember to report first...also to regain some thicker skin.    Pursuing the small claims option but I'm not hopeful there.  though this put me out of two weekends and several weekdays...like a $1500 - $2000 loss

Thank you all for your contribution to this post.  Lots of helpful tips and good to hear from others on the platform as well. ""You're doing this because I'm black"", it sucks when people act like a stereotype. Now you know what passengers to avoid. I'm in the boat that thinks you should've just finished the ride. You might want to reconsider doing Lyft if this gets under your skin so badly. I hate customer service and I got out if it a long time ago for that reason. God help me if I have to get back into it again. I hate to say it, but I expect this sort of behavior from black women in my city.  I will do everything in my power to avoid picking them up because of this. same thing goes for black men too. Don't be creepy??? That's a good start."
Wait five minutes collect five dollars,7,23.739269586028875,Lyft,"Always a fun way to earn without doing any work. I just wish they gave less time. Like on shared rides. I mean wtf if they can be out in two minutes why give em five? Just shows how little our time is really valued, by lyft and customers!


Last night had a good one. Request comes in for a hotel. It’s almost ten minutes away. Only went cuz usually it’s a long ride to the airport. Get there and a series of texts come in from the third party who ordered the ride, about a girl waiting by a car. Wtf! 


No car or girl matching that description. At 30 seconds I call. No answer. No show and move on. Then they start blowing up my phone with calls. After a few I answered just to see wtf they were going to say. Some sad bs about how they paid and didn’t have more money and I had to go get them. Hung up mid sentence and continued on to get my next request shortly. Some folks will never understand how this works.","They should charge for wait time as soon as drivers arrived and drivers should also be paid the mileage rate that it took to get to the location. 

Nothing worse than driving 15 minutes or longer to a pick up. Wait another 5 minutes, take a passenger less than a mile to a 7-Eleven where they put their first stop. Then, take the pax back home for a grand total of $3. This type of scenario can easily be 30 minutes of time for a driver. Don't answer the call after you got cancel fee.  Next ride! So did you wait five minutes or 30 seconds? i had so many of these. People passive aggressively demanding service while crying about their situation then calling repeatedly/angry threatening texts. You get the ride request, drive the 5-15 minutes, wait the 5 minutes, call them/text them only to get no answer, then leave wasting 15-25 minutes only to have them blow up your phone about they were ""right there""or just ""needed a minute."" 

Bullshit. You requested service, you know exactly how far away i am, you ignore the automated message that im there, you ignore my calls/text, and now youre mad and tell me what's what? Nope. Not your personal chauffeur/slave, this is my living and youve wasted my time in primetime. Be careful. If you hit arrive and move 5 feet your $5 is void. No way to get it back even if you move to the original spot.

-source- happened to me. Hit arrive. Moved down the line. Didn't get $5 for no show because I moved after hitting arrive"

As if demand truly has anything to do with it. The algorithm matches you with rides that match how long or short Lyft wants you to drive that day.  If you are more valuable or less valuable to them (are you making tips or not, getting low rating, canceling rides etc.) Then the 'hot spots' are created to ensure there are a certain amount of drivers available in a certain area at a certain time.  A very small piece of the algorithm uses the data that is tracking based on past ride frequency in an area - but if you have ever attempted to pick up a ride after a major event you will see that the 'hot spot' is only shown is the designated area for pickup & never really on the outskirts yet somehow before when there was surge people would still find ways to request rides ""outside of the hot spot"" to lower their cost & make for an easier pick up... Hey Lyft stop adding this stupid shit and give us PT back"
What does California's classification of Lyft drivers as employees rather than independent contractors mean for Lyft riders' prices? Will it have any impact?,3,23.86295014159823,Lyft,,"All we can really do is speculate and wait.

Considering the last few years -- Lyft goes after drivers first. We're the ones that suffer in terms of price structuring. That's why pay rates have been eviscerated nation wide. PAX prices will rise regardless of AB5. AB5 will, however, become a scapegoat should Lyft concede and conform - thus resulting in higher prices for customers and rock bottom hours, rates, or areas of service for drivers in California.

Lyft reps continually lie to the press, claiming rate changes are not ""cuts"" and are merely a ""reshuffling of the formula."" ([fox17.com](https://fox17.com) \- Nashville).

Recently, Lyft terminated a driver because they defended themselves with pepper spray. When the press got ahold of the story, Lyft quickly reactivated the driver and offered minuscule compensation (according to their child).

Lyft only cares about public image and money. The same as every other for-profit company. My best guess from an economist stand point, is that there will be longer wait times for a driver to show up BECAUSE there will be a smaller number of drivers. 

Pricing should remain similar or slightly higher, how different? without data we have no idea. But just using basic econ  we can infer this will probably happen. I’m no business expert so take what I say with a grain of salt.

I personally don’t think it will affect Lyft rider’s price. Remember Lyft is a corporation and their bottom line is to maximize profit for their stakeholders. There is no reason to believe that Lyft hasn’t done any market research and is not charging the maximum amount they can charge without loosing revenue/profit.

In other words, at the current price, any raise in price will simply make them lose enough customer base their revenue/profit go down. The later part is simply unacceptable for their stakeholders.

Given this assumption, if the consumer/worker protection goes into effect, Lyft will have to find other ways to protect their bottom line other than raising prices, or suck it up and let their stakeholders/management/administration/employees take a hit to their income."

We could also make decisions democratically instead of leaving everything up to some asshole in an office.","there is an app in Wisconsin if im not mistaken that is trying what you are describing. I read the article on forbes about a month or two ago. I looked them up and they are only doing a local roll out for now. 

I bring this up because you may want to support those guys and make it happen. Austin also had a few options before uber/lyft but they all failed recently. 

Its a tough game but your mind is the right place. Locally owned franchises would do so much better than a nationwide platform. Literally someone could just create software, charge a startup fee, and boom. Correct. There's no good reason all companies can't be worker owned. It's more about the grassroots marketing & ""brand loyalty"" that is out there for Uber & Lyft.  They made sure that customers loved them with free parties for launches & getting people to buy in on the idea that government cannot stop us from having rideshare... It would take a lot of drivers willing to take the hit for customer service reasons on behalf of an independent app which is also very difficult given that Lyft/Uber AI learned drivers wages & thresholds for driving - making it very difficult to lose any money because you are fighting an uphill battle...

Stop defending Lyft on the basis of unprofitability.,29,24.229014956424084,Lyft,"After reading here for a while I noticed that a common retort to why drivers can't get paid more is that ""Lyft is unprofitable"" or something of that nature. I am here to tell you that they are unprofitable by choice. They spend boatloads of cash on R&D. Here is a quote from their recent 10Q SEC filing regarding R&D expenditures:

 

***Research and Development*** 

Research  and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related  compensation costs and facilities costs. Such expenses include costs  related to our autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and  development costs are expensed as incurred.

We  plan to continue to hire employees to support our research and  development efforts to expand the capabilities and scope of our platform  and enhance the user experience. We expect that research and  development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods  and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.

Here is a link to their filings: [https://investor.lyft.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items\_per\_page=10&order=field\_nir\_sec\_form&sort=asc](https://investor.lyft.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items_per_page=10&order=field_nir_sec_form&sort=asc)

&#x200B;

Stop being fooled into believing that they can't pay drivers more. They can. They just won't. They'd rather put their drivers out of work permanently. So please stop using unprofitability as an argument for anything, all it shows is that you have no idea what is actually going on inside Lyft.","Finally, someone said it! 

Aside from the dubiousness of Lyft and Uber’s poor spending habits, I hate the fact that so many technocratic types think that “self driving cars” will be the end of Lyft and Uber’s pesky problem with paying for labor.

That’s such a short sided argument. Ignoring the fact that self-driving cars are nowhere near being ready for widespread use, I don’t understand how they figure ownership costs just disappear with a self driving car.

With the current setup, we, the driver, eat all running expenses - that includes storing the vehicle, gas, and maintenance. 

The burden of that is half the battle; arguably paying the driver is a comparatively low cost of operating.

Just think, how on earth will these companies be profitable, ever? Let’s say they do magically come out with an autonomous Lyft or Uber, and they start implementing it tomorrow 

Now they have to pay for 

- any sort of maintenance costs, and they’ll likely be accelerated because they’re gonna be running these cars 24/7

- are these cars electric? Or gas? If they’re electric, you need the real estate and infrastructure to charge and store said vehicles. In a place like San Francisco? That could easily approach millions and millions of dollars right there alone! Just for the land and charging equipment! 

- if these are gas autonomous cars, who’s going to refuel them? Service them? Now you’ll likely need an ASE certified technician(s) just to service Lyft vehicles. That’s a skilled position, and not cheap.

- who’s going to clean these cars? Make sure they don’t turn into public toilets? Yet another paid position. 



Lyft and Uber should be focusing on staying fair, and tight and lean taxi services. Not this weird “tech company” BS. All the money going to driverless vehicles they have to be able to see that. In almost every industry, the people at the top are pursing automation with a vengeance, not because it makes such great economic sense, but because it pushes the workers out of the equation .... [deleted] I’ve honestly never seen this argument made on this sub. This is all by design, Lyft pays less realizing that it will lose some drivers to attrition, as autonomous driving becomes more of a reality drivers will even see less pay per mile until there’s a fleet of driverless vehicles able to support demand.  Then maybe, Lyft will be a profitable company. They won't raise rates either, which is also obvious. They keep trying to fight the Cola Wars with their competition rather than create a sustainable business model. A race to the bottom. There is no good reason why people can't create a worker-owned version of Lyft/Uber. The hardest problem would be the launch, but Uber/Lyft had to start somewhere. Imagine the 25% take only being for new drivers, and your share of profits rising as you contribute more to the company. We would also be more dynamic without a bunch of executives taking our hard-earned profits instead of lowering rates or reinvesting into marketing, benefits etc. If I had more time I'd do it myself. See these rideshare platforms are an ends to a means, they want to be the first to develop a rock solid AI system for driverless cars but they don't actually make cars but they can license the technology to auto manufacturers.

I'm just a driver but I know what these assholes are doing and while it's kinda stupid in my opinion, driverless cars mixed with human drivers is just a recipe for disaster to me but I could be wrong. Hell I was totally wrong about smartphones and how they would impact our lives. 

The platform that gets it right first, or at least makes it look like they got it right first, can patent it and then license the tech to car manufacturers like GM. The manufacturers will pay huge piles of cash to these platforms, making them cash cows for years to come and if you own a driverless car or not, they're still gonna hire you because in the long run the liability on them is lower if you carry your own insurance. 

They ain't replacing anyone with their own fleet, we're talking about over 100 million cars. That's a bit of a very large nut to pay for upfront and then insure, license and maintain? They'd spend every penny they got from the licensing deal. 

Now the question should actually be, Why the fuck are they even doing all this development in the first place because unbeknownst to the rideshare platforms, Detroit has been working on this for a few decades already. They've gotten way farther with it then anyone actually knows and they still haven't rushed to bring it to market for a very good reason. It'll increase car prices by  100%, who the hell is going to pay $100k for a Toyota Corolla?! Are you shitting me?! 

We need to wake these assholes up, they need to remember the guy who invented the variable speed intermittent wiper system now found on all cars, he died poor. The guy who invented disk breaks also died poor, as did the guy who invented cruise control. All had their ideas STOLEN and lost everything. To the car industry it's better to steal the tech and settle a lawsuit than actually pay for it outright. 

They need to stop shoveling cash into this stupid idea, let Uber develop this tech only to watch it get stolen and then have to go fight the big auto manufacturers in court for the crumbs. Lyft can make huge profits in the meantime, share with drivers and we all are happy and lyft will be in a good position for the uber fire sale once they go broke. I agree with most of this, but do you guys ever think that Lyft and Uber's goal isn't to actually have autonomous cars, but rather to develop and perfect the technologies required to do such a thing?

&nbsp;

For instance, a lot of people might think that Microsoft failed miserably in the mobile phone market. In a way they did, but Microsoft also owns tons of mobile technology patents which earns them billions of dollars per year. They get around $10 per phone sold because other manufacturers have to license their patents All these tech companies use that unprofitable model and take it out on the consumer... that maxim “if you aren’t paying your the product” (probably butchering that). What’s different about Lyft is that they have woven contractors into that model and it’s much more tangible to “users” (drivers). 

Same thing is happening with YouTube currently, and I suspect every tech company is going to have a crisis related to this in the near future."

Lyft driver refused to let me in - why?,32,24.72891078977949,Lyft,"I use Lyft quite a bit for work and have never had something like this happen. I ordered a Lyft to my Manhattan street corner and was standing outside waiting for it. I saw the car arrive and stop maybe 150 ft away so I waved to him to let him know it was me. He rolled up to me, looked me in the eye and just slowly shook his head. 

I was confused so went up to his driver's window and showed him my phone screen so he could see I was his passenger, to which he looked straight ahead and gave me the finger! 

I went to the back of the car to take a picture of his registration plates, and he sped through a red light, nearly hitting pedestrians. He drove away but didn't cancel the trip, so I was charged the $6 no-show fee (which I disputed and had returned)

I'm mainly curious why this guy would accept a job, then refuse to let me in after seeing me. I'm a 30 year old white woman in business dress. Any ideas?","That's weird but hilarious, minus the inconvenience. One white business lady must have made him sketched about all of them? He may have been upset that you were in a bad position for him to safely pick you up?

Edit-punctuation Oh, duh. Driver doesn't know your destination until they select arrive. Maybe he didn't like where you were going for some reason. Were ya smoking? No one knows.  It’s the passenger equivalent of when we drivers get low ratings and have no idea why. 

The whole rideshare scheme is based on high probability events.  Alas, low probability events do happen as well from time to time.  Try not to tho k about it.  Just dust yourself off and get back in the game (err...back seat of someone’s Camry or similar). I just had something similar happen to me not 10 mins ago! The driver stopped across the street from me, waved to me first to get my attention to let me know it was him and everything! He pulls into the street and I run over to catch him, checked the plates to be sure, (it's a red light) and when I go to open the door it's locked. 

Thinking maybe it's just that door, I try the front passenger, it's also locked, so he rolls down the window and just says ""What?"" When I said ""You're me Lyft driver, he said ""no"" and rolled the window back up. 

There was no cancellation though, he just disappeared out of the app! If I hadn't taken a screenshot from my notifications, I'd have no proof this dude accepted the ride and showed up at all! He just scummed you.  He’s a driver that is fed up with the reduction in bonuses, pay, and tips so he’s scumming no show fees from pax it’s the only way to stay even sorry bout it Maybe he just had to take a dump and you being there with your phone maybe he thought you were acting crazy. Just one of many possible explanations but we will never really know. i dont know about everyone else but corners are the worst possible place to pick up a person to me. gotta stop traffic as there is often no where to park...even if you ""do it all the time"".

A guy left his phone in my car tonight and I went to return it and he gave me this,35,25.324408474978473,Lyft,Image,"Dam that’s awesome.normally you gotta request through Lyft for a return fee. The 4 times I had to return something Lyft only compensated me once. And I had to argue with them for it. It was an hour drive each way just to return a phone. The other 3 they refused. Finally someone who knows the value of someone else's time in addition to being kind and appreciative.

The majority of pax out there believe it's your job to drop everything you are doing to bring them their phone like you are some kind of errand boy for no tip.

Considering a new phone is close to $1k today and an insurance claim deductible is often $150 to $200 this is a decent tip. Had a pax leave his brand new iPhone in the car last week. I returned it and... nothing. Not even a tip. Lucky. A pax yesterday left a bunch of wine bottles in my car, I was nice and found him at a winery to drop them off...he gave me a whopping $5 tip. I should've charged him the lost item fee. Relying on the generosity of passengers is a fool's errand. That’s how it’s done. Hey, that was me! What are the odds! Thanks a lot for returning the phone. You deserve it. I think the real question here is, did you get your $10? Now don’t spend that all in one place, son. Plus the 15 I hope I don't know about the rest of you, but tips like that make my day. Please be grateful for these rare occasions occur. In my experience, they come in right when I really need them. That's what a phone return should be worth. A cheap smartphone costs $350. Your time on the return should be at least $15. $40 gratuity on top is just reasonable. He must be rich Yeah I was promised the same thing too... But in the app..lol never seen nothing.. Best I got was $100 for a wallet. Nice guy that's appreciative that he didn't have to buy a new phone :) Make sure you report it to IRS lol It used to be $20 in my market but they dropped it to $15. Are they pocketing the 5? Were you expecting more? Less? Nothing?  Honest question here I was joking- Should’ve sold the phone tbh"
Service dog,19,25.500889956470992,Lyft,"I picked up my first ever passenger who claimed to have a ""service dog"" today.  I couldn't cancel the ride out of risk of deactivation, so I asked her to have the dog sit on her lap (small corgi), the dog immediately gets in first, throwing hair and dirt all over the place.  She claims the dog has to sit in the seat to help with her panic attacks.  I call 100% bs on this and 1 starred her and got a $25 cleaning fee.  Anything I can do in the future?  This literally killed my rides for the day.","A service dog always sits on the ground > This literally killed my rides for the day.

You couldn't just hit up a vaccuum for 5 min? is the dog a service animal required because of a disability? and  what work or task has the dog been trained to perform, the task question always gets people who just have the vest off Amazon they don’t think ahead that far, anyone who has a service animal cause they need it will  say diabetic etc cause they know what they have, on a side note I would much rather pickup dogs that people You can just drive away, select that you didn't see the passenger and cancel. The end. Hell NO. How did you get a $25 cleaning fee? I thought Lyft has you submit reciepts for cleaning to get reimbursed only? Nope sadly this is one of the protected service animal reasons. I feel for you, at least you got $25 most of thre time we get 💩 sandwiches. I keep a blanket and towel in my car just for this reason.  Cover your seats and it's a non-issue."
LYFT EVASION PROVOKES LITIGATION,15,25.518702456470994,Lyft,"Hello,

I'd like to know if my fellow rideshare fans have been taken nowhere by Lyft's BS  runaround tactics. They follow one simple rule: Play all passengers for a fool who fall for any BS line to stall long enough until legit beefs magically go away. On 3 different occasions its so-called ""response team"" made no reply to serious documented beefs except false accusations of illicit drug possession, followed by 'permanent' closure of my account. 

INCIDENT #1: FAT SLOB ON THE JOB DRUNK AS A SKUNK

After 4 cancelled right before they were due to arrive, I was more than an hour late and quite upset one night when Number Five finally did show in my driveway. He's a fat slob so at least 400-lb weight is a tight fit behind the wheel of his tiny compact. As we drive off, I asked to vape my frustration away that's unfair to take out on innocent parties. He said okay, but pulled into the parking lot of a casino shortly after, where I got ordered out on the spot for ""violating his rules"" by vaping! Nevermind it was a dark night during massive street construction, I wore high heeled shoes and had to walk several blocks while carrying a large box to reach my final destination. The clincher was a distinct odor of alcohol on his breath during this entire ride to hell. Despite all that, my legitimate beef got dismissed by Lyft's response team along with account closure for alleged ""feedback that I was in possession of a substance"" (!)

INCIDENT #2: RUDE DRIVER W/ BAD ATTITUDE

Less than 6 months after restoration of my 5-star rider status by 2d registration with a new email address, an encore performance ensued when another rude driver's bad attitude exhibition began. This episode left me stranded once again, then banned by Lyft for alleged ""feedback"" regarding illicit substance possession. That notification was an exact duplicate of the first one in every detail but recipient email address. Even despite videotaped footage of this entire replay captured by fone cam and sent along with my initial complaint. 

INCIDENT #3: NICE DRIVER PAID TWICE 

This tale had a plot played quite well by a driver who did not exude a bad attitude. But when that rare positive experience came to an end I discovered why. On glancing at my Lyft rider app window still open after stepping from the vehicle, I saw a bill for double the amount of my real fare. So I disputed it with Lyft promptly. Guess what their fast reply said? That's right!  You guessed it again. ""Feedback that you were in possession...""... macro-generated canned response to every legit serious beef.

So ever since then, every message I send to Lyft has my own auto-generated tagline that says ""Please don't reply with a BS drug possession email like 3 times before and address the core substantive matters at hand in this communication. Thanks for your cooperation in advance.""","If you walk down the street and meet an asshole, they’re the asshole.

If you walk down the street and meet ten assholes, you’re the asshole. This reads like the ramblings of a person who needs to speak to the manager on a frequent basis. Wtf, lyft has you figured out it seems. Stick that vape up your ass, paxhole. Save your time on spiritual masturbating at litigation and go into rehab instead. The time you spend there will be handsomely compensated by a longer life expectancy, and a less stressful one. My head hurts...feel terrible for those drivers I’m so lose. So OP was smoking weed in vape form in the car? No offense-lol jk, all offense-you sound like an ignorant bitch. If you never use lyft again, all of us drivers will breathe a collective sigh of relief."
"I hit 7k rides for first time, Lyft showed me a Trophy. Also today I'm doing $24/hr thanks to tips despite the .35c a mile rate. If it wasn't for pax tips we'd be fucked so big thanks to customers",13,25.61046171573853,Lyft,Image,"How many hours do you drive per day? measuring your profits in hourly is pointless because the variance is too great. There's no value in saying you made $24/hr today because you obviously know you cant repeat that. What you really want to do is measure in miles or in rides. In this case you earned $10/ride which is good but also pretty standard. So youre most likely doing everything right and not making any mistakes. Damn 7k? What city do you drive. 
I am 5.8k here in Seattle and 2 months away from my 2 year mark. Thanks for holding Minneapolis down. Stopped driving back in April but when I take a lyft I tip big for you guys. Truth. 1/3 of my take home is from passenger tips though I need 60-75% tip rate to make that happen. Fri-Sun is the only time the tip rate hits that high in Sacramento.  Better off doing Amazon Flex or a retail. Sorry, I'm downvoting anything which even appears to be trying to justify the 35 cents a mile rate no matter what."
Why aren't you #Tipping your #Lyft drivers?,20,25.669119123145936,Lyft,"Hey Lyft riders! You can tip your Lyft drivers! And you should! I know a lot of you (especially in Denver) are working 2 to 3 jobs to pay rent and I'm not judging you, because I know you need every dollar that you work hard for. But for those who that doesn't apply to, if you can afford a $5 Lyft ride, you can afford another dollar to help someone make a living for providing you a convenient service. And if you are riding with friends and you can afford to take yourselves out for cocktails, you can definitely spare another $2.  If your drivers car is clean, and your driver is polite and driving safely, there's no excuse for stiffing on a tip.","As both a driver and rider, I couldn't agree with you more, but this post comes off as pretty off putting. Especially with #Unnecessary #Hashtags. Because I am broke 🤷 I only take Lyft to work when my ride bails and public transportation does not operate early enough for me to get to work on time. Despite all this,  I usually do tip, but sometimes I am like fuck it. It is costing me too much money to even get to work. >if you can afford a $5 Lyft ride, you can afford another dollar to help someone make a living for providing you a convenient service.

if they are working 2-3 jobs to pay rent, then they probably can't afford a $5 lyft ride, but have no better option.

>And if you are riding with friends and you can afford to take yourselves out for cocktails, you can definitely spare another $2.

that, I agree with.

>If your drivers car is clean, and your driver is polite and driving safely, there's no excuse for stiffing on a tip.

I disagree.  that difference in cost might be the tipping point to ""I guess I just have to get up early and walk"" or ""do I get this expensive ride and keep my job, or risk losing it from being late""

I think its weirder to expect someone working two jobs to be able to afford a tip, really. I don’t tip drivers that don’t help me with my luggage.  I know some drivers say it isn’t their job to help with luggage, but If taxi drivers do it, I think drivers should to.

Otherwise, $2 min tip  or 20%, whichever is more. Because Lyft is charging us too much already. GOD DAMN..  PREACH BROTHA! I’ll go the whole day without a tip and I usually go above and beyond for pax, like loading and unloading groceries, ect and never get tipped. But then there’s always that one pax at the end that tips me 2$ right at the end of my night and it makes my whole day. I used Lyft everyday before I started driving for Lyft and I never tipped. I still take Lyft a even though I’m a driver now and I always make it a point to tip Atleast 3$ cause I know it’s going to be a shitty 3$ ride for the driver. Tip folks! Please !"
Drivers on this sub...,58,25.884686252789365,Lyft,"It seems like most of the drivers on this sub are extremely bitter and angry I’ve gathered. I’m NOT saying everyone but I’m a new driver and a lot of the feedback I’ve been getting is fucking quit and run while you can. Honestly, I’m enjoying it so far and don’t really have any complaints other then not getting paid to drive 10 miles to pick someone up and then get paid 3$ for the ride. Maybe it had to do with our market areas being different but everyone keeps telling me I might as well quit because Lyft is just going to fuck me anyways. What has happened in your market areas or to you by Lyft that had made you so bitter towards driving for Lyft","The problem a lot of drivers have in their market not all markets is it's not a livable income.  You should never work for less than minimum wage and in some markets there's no way to make more than that.  These companies have gotten to greedy.  Drivers are the ones doing all the work assuming all the liability and not making any money.  part time full time as a side hustle as a hobby doesn't matter that's unacceptable. I don't flock to the internet when things go smoothly only when I need to vent.

It's not as lucrative as it used to be so watching their pay get hacked isn't going to make people recommend something.

Driver's wanted to get paid more for time - so the company cut mileage rates. Driver's wanted to get paid to go pick people up - so the company cut mileage rates. If you interpret it as negativity I understand. The fact is as drivers we are for the most part isolated from our co workers and lack a place to vent about the areas of the job that can be problematic.

Just try not to buy into the negativity and you will learn plenty from reading here. It’s been a valuable tool for me.

Of course there will be vocal users with negative attitudes, it’s like that as the internet is a place for them to voice their problems and be heard, whether full or part time, from whatever areas of the country or whatever background they may have, everyone has their own views.


Personally since I have started nearly six months ago they have changed the way we are paid for busy times which used to be a way to compensate drivers for dealing with stressful situations like high traffic and poorly managed pickups at events. 

Instead we now have a low paying ppz thay may show up randomly once in a week or even not for two or three weeks. Then you may get one for 15 or 30 bucks. Yet lyft still charges customers for the higher demand. It’s a big frustration for us all who made more before.


Seems like the longer you do this the more changes you will endure, changes that generally affect your income in a negative way.

Lack of good support is another issue. I’ve had a chance to be denied for a legit issue and it feels bad when they don’t have our backs and just ignore follow ups.

I could go on about other issues but those are the top things in my mind.

Be aware that you are an important resource to a company that views you as exploitable and expendable in the extreme. The more experienced drivers have seen their pay rates diminish significantly over time.  And they have seen Lyft become better at their algorithms (which means more manipulative of their driver partners). ive done it almost a year and i really do enjoy it as well.  for me its the social aspect of meeting such a varied group of folks. recently lyft started withholding money from me as they had a glitch in their app. its been a month now so it was incentive for me to start posting here. i hope my posts havent come across as negative but im trying to determine if this is an issue that others have experienced.  i wish you the best and i hope it works out well for you. I just started yesterday, and I'm loving it as well. It's a vocal minority, in my experience. I can agree with you on this. I wish they (U/L) would stop trying to compete with mass transit. I still get ridiculous pickup requests....trip distance 0.6 miles,  or 0.4miles. If they would make the minimum fare higher, fewer people would waste our time with these trips. Even so, I believe that you can do well in almost any market. Except for maybe Pierre, South Dakota or Helena, Montana. I noticed it too. A lot of these drivers are in the wrong profession and it is ridiculous its about experience.  Its about being relaxed and chill until that one entitled person comes along and tells you i gotta make a quick 1 min stop at XYZ and they leave their bag behind.  and they come back 15 minutes later.

You know what that means...no more stops at XYZ or places like that.  gas stations only...and if your not back in 5 minutes...even if you leave something...bye felicia.

Its about being cool with a pax, dropping them off somewhere unscheduled, and getting reported and your fare taken.

Picking up a pax from a pool party and explicitly asking them if they got in the pool, cuz i have towels if you did.  They say no and leave your seats all wet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I still drive a few blocks from pick up areas if they got it wrong....until someone cancels for not making progress

i still do stops along the way until someone screws it up. The only bitter people here are the ignorant ones who tried to do a part time gig full time. Drive the way the platform was designed and have fun."
A lyft driver screamed at me on top of his lungs for giving directions to my house when the app took him to the wrong drop off. I didnt respond on the spot and got out when my stop came. I gave him one star and reported to lyft support from the app. Should I instead speak to them to fire the driver?,19,25.912244123159734,Lyft,,"We are not “employed” by Lyft. So unless there are continual reports about this behavior nothing will happen. They just up and started hollering at you?

No, you should not try to get them fired. The app is never wrong You’re literally asking if you should be a “Karen” and speak to his “manager” to get him fired...

First, the universal response should be to give him 3 stars and leave the guy to live his god damned sad ass life. He prob doesn’t need you to run up and kick him while he’s down if he’s having a shit day. 

If he’s a shit person, it’ll come back to him soon enough.

No one here knows who you are or what it’s like to drive you. I imagine since he knew you’re well off financially, you probably talked a bit. Maybe said some condescending things?

Last, he’s not employed by Lyft. He’s a contractor being paid a diminishing return on a business venture that was reasonably profitable as recently as a year ago. After the IPOs, both lyft and Uber have been straight dry fucking drivers with little or no shits given.

People can’t just stop and start careers, so for you and all the idiot trolls who like to shit on drivers, this seemed like an industry to get into and he might have a decent amount of time, assets, and effort invested.

To think you should fuck someone over by maliciously escalating BEYOND the standard rating system makes me think you’re kind of a bitch, but idk, prove me wrong Karen. Shut up. One-starring means he will get a message.  

Reporting him means he may get fired.  Err...removed as a partner.  

Which outcome does the behavior warrant? Wrong drop off? Him snapping at you is pretty insane assuming it happened exactly as you said, but just for future reference let the drivers drive, unless you think they are wasting your time taking ridiculously inefficient routes to pad the bill. Otherwise the GPS *will* get you there eventually, 1 or 2 ""wrong"" turns isnt going to hurt you. Keep in mind we get *a lot* of pax who think they know some superior way when it's really just the way they learned and always take. I have actually shown irate pax ""the GPS way"" and they calmed down and gave me credit saying ""you know I never knew you could go this way, I'll have to remember this"". Man be honest with yourself do you ever have bad days? If you do let it slide it just sometimes happens but it shouldn’t but under stress some drivers break. You should definitely email customer service and file a complain as they will investigate."
Uber,2,26.103922363911515,Lyft,How do i contact uber or lyft if a rider wants to gi 200 miles away? Tia,Well you really only have 2 choices  accept the ride or cancel the ride. There's really no reason to contact the support line. Make sure the drop address is correct in the app so you're not going outside the max distance (you won't get paid for anything above max distance) Make sure to accept the ride and then tell the pax they have to wait while you call support for long trip approval.

Lost a Unicorn ride I really wanted thanks to a jealous douchebag,53,26.351676993552182,Lyft,"As I was heading home tonight I got a 45+ ping 2 minutes away. I'd had a slow night, so I took it, but she cancelled immediately.   


I kept driving home, and when I'm about two blocks from my house, I got the same ping again. First instinct was to ignore it, but I took it.  


This time she didn't cancel. I arrived and looked at the destination. It's a round-trip. I punched in the address for the first stop into the GPS and it's 127 miles away. YAHTZEE!!!. This is going to be a 250+ mile trip, ending a few minutes from my house. Even at base fare, I was expecting to make close to $300. About $75 per hour. I'll take it.   


A woman comes out and explains that she's taking her daughter to a family member's house and coming right back. She wanted to make sure I wasn't tired. I said that I was fine for the long drive and she went back inside to get her daughter.   


They come out with small suitcase, which I put in the trunk, and as mom is buckling the car seat, a shirtless dude comes out of the house. That's when I realized this wasn't going to be as easy as I had hoped.  


He tells the woman something like ""I thought you called a female driver"". The woman said she's been trying to get female drivers for over 30 minutes and the two female drivers that she got did not want to drive that far (and that explains the first cancellation I got from her).   


Then he asks ""do you know this guy""?  She says ""no, he's the Lyft driver that's going to take us there and bring me right back"".   


And the dude proceeds to have a meltdown in the driveway, screaming at the top of his lungs ""NOOOOO. I FUCKING TOLD YOU TO GET A FEMALE DRIVER. YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITH THIS GUY"". 

The woman tries to calm him down, saying the neighbors will call the cops, but he keeps yelling. Finally she takes him back into the house. The scared little girl is still strapped to her car seat when I get the dreaded cancellation notice ping. At least this time I got $5. 

The woman comes out to get her daughter, apologizes profusely, I asked if she was going to be okay, she says yes, and I drove away. As I pull into my driveway I realize the suitcase is still in the trunk. Fuck.   


I drive back to the house hoping to see the lady maybe catching her next Lyft, but I didn't. I parked at a nearby corner for a few minutes debating what to do, thinking that crazy motherfucker was going to shoot me if he saw me near the house.   


I finally got tired of wasting time on this shit show, walked up to the house, left the suitcase in the porch, and came back home. Now I have to explain everything to Lyft just in case something happens to this woman and her daughter.   


We don't get paid enough for this.","I love that the guy was so concerned for his girlfriend's safety, yet proceeds to go back into the house while leaving the child completely unattended in your car. I'm going to nominate this guy for jealous douche-bag of the year. Please upvote this story so hard so people can see the shit the put us through.  I've had to deal with this on SO MANY levels as a female driver.  Many women tell me they feel ""safer"" with me & they look for female drivers to be their get away driver.  I love helping people and I am all for looking out for my sisters out here dodging shitty men who thrive off of the patriarchy BS - but seriously, I drive a Nissan, this aint the batmobile & I don't have any weapons in car except a light saber from disneyland that I use from time to time in the park with my nerdy ass friends...LYFT YOU TAKE FAR TOO MUCH MONEY FROM EACH FARE, WHEN DRIVERS LITERALLY HAVE TO DO SHIT LIKE THIS EVERY FUCKING DAY! I would have just told him I'm gay. This is so depressing. Those poor females :( Was this in the IE? File a red flag complaint on him. I would have told the dude to just come with us. > YAHTZEE!!

Any chance you listen to the Savage Love Cast? That's horrible and exhausting and I'm really sorry. It sucks that you lost the fare, it sucks tremendously that she's in that situation, and it sucks pretty unspeakably that that child is growing up in that environment. Brutal all around. Tell him you *identify* as female, and if he says anything, then just call him a trans-phobe! Why does it seem you care more about the money you lost out on than the fact that this woman's husband is probably abusing them? I'm usually not very confrontational but I probably would have got out of the car and very nicely told the guy ""I have over 5,000 trips with rideshare and another 20,000+ as a taxi driver.  Not once have I ever hit on or harassed a passenger.  Not once.  Your girlfriend is safe with me and you have my personal guarantee.""  I wouldn't have fought with him about it or anything but I would have at least tried this.  Now if it was a $4 ride to Walmart, of course I wouldn't bother. you didn't need it this time, but what if this dude came out with a knife?

that's why its important for every uber/lyft driver to be armed

you'll probably never need it, but if you do, the right pistol could save your life

stay safe, and stay armed people!

its a crazy world ! Being a woman really pays. My question is why do people think women are safer? What's the logic behind that? You must live in either the south or the midwest because out here in Cali that would never happen."
"Look at this garbage: Lyft is fraud and needs to be stopped. Write to your local and state legislatures. We need to make it known that we are the ones physically providing services and deserve better treatment. Lyft a disease that deserves eradication, act to stop these kinds of unethical practices!",21,26.488170049107737,Lyft,Image,"Damn 65 percent commission Most likely you picked someone up ( An elderly person ) that used their health insurance company to call for a ride The real fraud is when they take 30-40% on long rides. Obviously lyft has to take a minimum amount per ride, it's not like they're going to charge the pax $1 and give you the rest. It's when they scale their charges with ride duration that I get pissed. There is no ride where lyft ever deserves more than $15 of the fare, as their costs dont increase proportionally the same way ours does. Last Friday there was a bonus for $210 for 25 rides, I was at 15 rides of the 25 and the whole fucking night I got no requests. 4 hours straight. I even changed cities. There's an easy solution to this. Create a driver Coop and put Lyft and Uber out of the number 1 and 2 rideshare position. They're service fees are insane. There are other rideshare companies that only charge the driver $1 per ride for a booking fee. Exactly how is this fraud? California is about to do exactly this, and it'll basically mean most of the drivers will be kicked off the platform and everyone left will have to drive full time. This breakdown is typical of Lyft to take almost $4 off the top just to hail a ride. As a frequent passenger with a 5-star rating they've justified it to me as fair to cover expenses for equipment that automates the system and makes it possible. BS! Technology LOWERS operating costs by eliminating time and labor. You get paid in a formula for distance driven plus time and a pick up fee. i don't see what is the problem. 

This is what entitlement looks like people. Big yikes And yet you will continue to drive for Lyft, right?  At this point it’s not Lyft who is fucking you, you are knowingly fucking yourself. No sympathy and no phone call to legislators. Seems proper to me. Want more money? Drive a van or a Cadillac then. You can make twice as much from A xl ride than you can with a regular and three times as much with a lux. The best is lux xl, at four times the regular rate"

How are your tips doing guys?,20,26.616040419489146,Lyft,Image,"I find lyft passengers tip far more than uber passengers. Does each ride end happy? Had my first day yesterday. 7 out of 9 tipped. One guy tipped me $5 for a $7 ride. Got a guy going round the corner to 7-11 and back home he tipped $25 in cash, then airport rider this morning I got $20 in app plus a few 2 n 3 for a total of about $60. Then also two no shows and two ppzs for another ten each - $30 bux for a total of $90 in extras, it was kind of a shitty night for Friday for me so the extras really made up for it. Very Poor in S Florida. Rides have been almost non existent in the Ft Lauderdale area for months. Way to many drivers and not enough customers to keep anyone busy even on Saturday.
Add to that the fact that the Lyft app has slowed to a crawl, takes a couple of minutes just to come on. It's no wonder customers are calling Uber at  I believe the ate is 4 - 1. Tomorrow Sat. Sept 14 I'm gonna try going entirely with Uber and see for myself."
Just signed up and I got a 1000$ guarantee if I get 125 rides in 30 days. Do they offer more later on or is it a one time thing?,75,26.76327421579924,Lyft,Image,"No one knows.  I have never received any such quests or bonus offers since my initial ride one.  Others get them on the regular.  

It might be market dependent (based on their projected need).   It might be based on their intent to manipulate your behavior to their benefit.  It likely is both. 

Good luck out there. So, that's an $8 average ride.. You'll make more than $1k on 125 rides.. Don't think that its your ride money PPLUS $1k... of course you'll make $1000 on 125 rides.

One time thing, this is their way of hooking you to the app. Be prepare to see $150 guarantees for 20-30 rides in the future cause that’s all you’re probably gonna get. The guarantees are an illusion to get you out there... you'll probably be prioritized higher paying rides to make sure lyft doesnt lose money and they may or may ot offer you another one... but ultimately they all disappear. Generally they won’t offer anything similar, but they will every once in a blue moon. 

I got offered a $325 guarantee for 40 rides for Friday 5am to Monday 5am. 

By Saturday night, I got to 25 rides. I knew that it was going to be impossible to get to 40. If anything my last two rides would have likely been long rides to the airport. Forgive the ignorance in this thread, lot of low IQ posters that cant do 3rd grade math. Yes you will get these offers all the time, but they are mostly meaningless because the offer is equivalent to what you'd make just driving regularly anyway. Occasionally in your case you will actually exploit the offer and get lyft to dip into their piggy back to ensure your guarantee. I sometimes get these offers every single week ""$150 for 20 rides!!"" and stuff. It's nonsense because I'll probably make $150 in 15 rides. They won't allow you the 125 rides lol. And you won't get any $1000 bonus even for 1000 rides. It's all just bullsht to get people to sign up with them."
Lyft notified that they are aware of problem with rental rewards not showing for lyft express drive,12,26.800785789873313,Lyft,"i received an email from lyft saying they are working on the problem of the disappearance of rental rewards for lyft express drive folks.   in its place you will see ride challenges with max bonus of 87 for 110 rides whereby rental rewards max bonus  is 175 for 95 rides.   im still waiting over three weeks for them to credit me back the difference of 88 per week since i hit the full bonus and should have been on rental rewards. 

they keep saying be patient. just thought id post this as a heads up. 

good luck","Mine disappeared for a couple hours and I sent a dozen tickets about it before it was fixed.

No way I'd keep driving without the bonus. Mine are still there. I think something was messed up with your account specifically.

Do you have the rewards back now? [removed] How do we sign up for those rewards tho? I'm renting a car and I drive in New Jersey."
Venting about some drivers,21,26.86821634542887,Lyft,"I get it, some of you don’t want to talk to me, but can I at least get a “Hello”?!? This is still costumer service. If I greet you, don’t ignore me. I’m shy, so I understand not wanting to talk, but shit. I will give $5 tip if I click with a driver and they really show me interest & act like they care. I’m an honest person. I usually give 5 stars, but if you’re ignoring even my greeting to you, you better believe I’ll give 1 star or just not give you any stars at all.
I don’t like to do anything that can harm anyone’s job, but I don’t give free good reviews either. I truly don’t mind if we don’t talk, but you guys that don’t even talk to me throughout the whole ride, that’s rude.","I’d like to put things in perspective here. I understand what you’re saying, but there’s another side to this. Let’s say you use Lyft twice a day, to and from work. So 5 days a week you’re seeing 10 drivers. The majority of us see *at least* 10 riders *per day*. While you wish drivers would be a little bit more friendly, we are exposed to waaaay more people and would wish that *riders* were more friendly. 

A typical day goes with a slight variation of this:

Me - Hi! This is for John?

Pax - .......

Me - Ok, and we’re going to 1060 W Addison?

Pax - <UGH> Yeah. 

Me - Great. Traffic looks light, so we should be there in about 20 minutes. 

Pax - .......

<at the destination>

Me - Alrighty sir, here we are. Thank you and have a great day!

Pax - .......<slam>

Me - Jackass. 

I’m not saying that either side is right, I’m just trying to let you know that the majority of us feel the same way. The problem is that we’re worn down by many more people before you even get to us. The least we can do is say hello I agree. It's basic courtesy and those drivers are probably disgruntled and should be doing something else.  


On the flip side, we get that from riders too, at least several times per day. I don't chit chat during a ride unless the rider clearly wants conversation, but there is still a human driving, At least say hello. I'm a driver, and I completely agree with you. Some drivers don't even greet you?! It’s not customer service you need a ride or you’re beating your feet.

You’re not paying us to talk this isn’t an escort service I couldn’t feel more the opposite.  I feel awkward when drivers force conversation on me. Confirm I’m the right passenger and listen to whatever music or radio you want, but don’t force me into conversation. I had a ride recently where I didn't talk. It wasn't on purpose. I was just tired and then I was like screw it I'm going to stay quiet. We're drivers. If you crave a convo you should initiate one. For us, it gets tiring. I always tell pax hello because customer service
Means every pax is a new encounter . However it is beyond my control if pax insists my name is Trunk or Door or gets mad I didn’t unlock my door right away. At restaurants my name was Diet Coke or Draft Beer *shrug* Driver's drive. Please take the bus instead. It goes both ways. As a driver I always offer the casual typical greetings, I don’t mind a good conversation either but passengers do the same thing. One time I said “ ok good talk” and all of a sudden buddy spoke and got all upset.  It could be choked up to having a bad day but he was just on the phone talking to someone laughing his ass off. He was just ignoring me I guess Be careful who you 1 star! Every person you give a rating of 3 or below to is a person that you will never be paired with again. This means that you are reducing the number of people available to give you rides. Do you want to do that just because you don’t get any conversation? If the driver got you to your destination quickly, safely, and without issue, why give a 1 star? He may be a local driver who may be available to you again in the future should you ever need another ride!"
Waze or not to waze,8,26.989871438032498,Lyft,What is ur guys veiw on waze for lyft?,"1) it’s the absolute best at beating traffic. 

2). It’s totally the worst because it takes you down side streets not meant for that use, often requiring impossible left turns onto busy thoroughfares. Waze. Map chat, user reports, honking at other users via the app, sounds cool, gives you fake points. If you like taking the backstreets’s backstreets, or maybe you live in a tiny city where google can’t be trusted, I guess it’s fine. 

I don’t like it telling you to go behind stores and stuff like that. 

Also I’ve had it deadend me into a gated backroad more than once and since I think Uber would frown on us bolt cutting a gate, I’d rather just take the regular roads. 

Plus I don’t want to have to switch between apps. Why worry about a 2 mile drive. 

That said, if it’s a 30+ min trip or has a toll, I’ll push it to google. How do you guys do it? Do you accept your ride then put the address in In wade and just follow wave instead of the driver app? for the 1001th time

The difference between Google Maps and Waze is just an enable button within Google, whether to trust all the Waze editors and whether to do aggressive routing that may or may not be welcomed.

The integrated navigations are useless if you can't select alternative routes and choose whether to use tolls or not. But you need those for the endpoints because they don't pass all the info to external navigation apps but just the GPS co-ordinates. So you may be off by a few houses for example.

I had riders asking why I don't use Waze like I""m an idiot. Because he is

#1 Waze doesn't tell you the best lane to take.

#2 Waze icons are child's play. Only retards look at those. Why I want to see other waze users on my tiny phone screen?

#3 Waze is very disruptive. You will be notified for all the cars parked well off traffic on the shoulders. There are thousands of such cars per mile.

#4 Waze knows carpool lanes but they messed it up big time. They have no way to know the speed in the lane so they rely on drivers' data. Waze will tell you to drive into and off the carpool lane every other mile for nothing.

Any way to see who left a tip on a Shared ride?,6,27.484813567673164,Lyft,"  
I don't do many shared rides on Lyft, but I took a few today, and someone made a mess on part of the seat and the back floor. They spilled a frothy drink and didn't say anything. It was a lot of liquid. When I noticed I had to go offline, find a car wash with a good vacuum, and clean the mess. Time wasted was about 30 minutes and $1.50 for the vacuum, as I was not near my membership car wash.  


  
Initially I blamed a couple who got in with Starbucks drinks, but after reviewing the dash cam tonight I realized it was another woman on a long, 4 pick-up Shared ride.  


But someone on that Shared ride tipped me $5. If it was the woman who spilled the drink, we'll call it even stevens, because at least she tried to make amends. But if it was someone else, I want to rate the spiller 3 stars.   


I know it's petty and somewhat childish, but it helps me sleep better at night, and it helps other drivers identify the douchy passengers. So is there any way to see the person that actually left the tip?","Nope, poor design. Just be thankful a shared rider tipped.

Not all shared rides are bad but you can count on them not being great. I had a rare exception tonight. 3 riders each going further than the last, made a circle around LA and $48 bucks in an hour. Then as luck would have it, found another ride right away heading back to dtla. I believe you can view the earnings breakdowns for the individual rides and view each one and see if there is a tip included. You let people in your car with food and drinks? That’s an automatic cancel. 

They need a grocery cart or DoorDash for food delivery - not my car."
This is a improvement? I used to have 6.!,20,27.631468660265757,Lyft,Image,"There are limits to how many you can have? Holy shit! The bonus is down to $1 per ride now?

If it gave you preference on a favorable match, it'll be limited.

Received a Final deactivation warning,11,27.696017271390666,Lyft,"Hi, I'm a driver and I recently received an email stating that i have a final warning about unsafe driving and that my account can be deactivated. My driver rating is 5 stars and I checked my feedback, and since July 19th until today September 12th I've had only 5 stars. I also can't find any other warning emails... what should I do? I rely on lyft as a main source of income .

&#x200B;

Any help is appreciated thank you","Guy posted about a similar issue in the /r/Lyftdrivers section. Are you in Cali? Here's the link to his thread:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/lyftdrivers/comments/d3d5y4/im\_starting\_to\_break\_out\_my\_tinfoil\_hat/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lyftdrivers/comments/d3d5y4/im_starting_to_break_out_my_tinfoil_hat/) if you recieved an email from Lyfts trust and safety team, you would know what this is about. If not, it sounds like bullshit. When i got my notice, i was told that i was reported as speeding, unsafe lane changes, running lights, etc. to which I denied citing my drinving experience, training, etc. 

I would contact Lyft directly to see if this is legitimate and if so, what are the specific allrgations. Get another primary source of income playboy. I got one as well. For me there’s a totally reasonable chance that it was actually a passenger I had that was... Unpleasant to put it nicely (old lady)

Didn’t receive an email EVER about this from them, nor did I have any in app warnings

Something sketchy’s afoot I posted about this a few days ago and just got off the phone with them. They gave me the “gentle reminder” crap about it being an automated message for everyone. But don’t be fooled: this is a very real threat, because if even one pax one-stars you, your account is at risk of being deactivated. 

What I learned via phone with their safety department is that apparently the whole time we’ve been driving, any time we receive a bad one star complaint from a pax we’re supposed to call Lyft and give “our side of the story.” Apparently now there’s a threshold for one-star reviews that if you have received enough of them they can pull this shit and deactivate you. 

So while I was on the phone with them (which I highly recommend, it’s costly to the company for them to have to respond to so many calls, which they fully deserve for pulling this shit) I decided if what they said is true, they should send me an email with every single safety complaint I’ve ever gotten and I should have a chance to “give my side of the story.”  And to my surprise they said they actually will send it to my email.

Will I remember each and every encounter? Absolutely not. But neither will the passenger. So I can come up with whichever defense I think is best, but most importantly, save my own ass while wasting Lyft’s time and resources.

Obligatory “fuck this company.” God is sending the emails,. Can your hear the message...."
"""Your earnings ALWAYS start with a base rate!"" No shit? You just decided to eradicate that base rate altogether, and your f*cking reason is?

Lyft: ”Great job! You owe $5.49!” What. The. Fuck. some serious bullshit, I know uber isnt doing that Question: do you drive a rental from Lyft? I seem to recall seeing another post about this and the driver was driving under the Lyft rental program. LA market hasn’t had a base fare / pickup fee in YEARS 😭 There's a difference between base rate & minimum fare. OP may know this but I suspect most drivers don't understand what the base rate is.

base rate is what gets added to your fare just for making the pickup. Minimum fare is what you will be paid if your total fare would otherwise be below the minimum.

So they lowered it from $0.40 to 0. Surprised? That's 2 minutes of idling.

If one thing is for certain with rideshare, it's that your rates will always continue to go down. The minimum trip is $3.75 No your correct. Learn somthing new every day! You guys do realize the base fair is the minimum you can get paid for a ride right? If the ride is more then that of the base fair the base fair is excluded. 

Example:
So in portland if I take some one for a 3 block ride I get the base fair 3.75. If its more than a couple miles you get the milage + time and the base fair is excluded. You dont get to add the base fair to miles and time....      and yes that is some bullshit lyft eats it."

"So, when the f*ck did this become okay?",5,27.90381819732763,Lyft,Image,"This is fairly common (90% of the time) in my market in San Antonio. A trip across town will rack up ~$12 and lyft will also earn $12. The other night I earned $2.62 while lyft earned $6+. The booking fee pax pay is $3.05. It’s absurd. Fraud.

Go offline permanently on lyft so that it becomes NOT OK. I haven't driven for Lyft for more than a year, and thank God I'm only doing it for a week since I rented a car on their dime. Literally taking advantage of that shady, unethical, and greedy business without feeling any remorse whatsoever!

Having given this ride today, my eyes almost fell out of their socket. So now we're looking at Lyft canceling the base fare altogether, and not giving a shit about keeping 60% of fares to themselves? What the actual f*ck?? 

When did this become okay and legal? And how the hell are people still driving for that piece of shit company with such unbelievably low rates? Don't like it?  Don't drive for them, quite simple."
Uber and Lyft say they don’t plan to reclassify their drivers as employees.,7,27.974084401042376,Lyft,Image,"[deleted] The bottom line is Uber and Lyft cannot afford to, it will break them.

I am against the bill as a driver because I don't want to be an employee of Uber or Lyft. Sure I would appreciate higher wages but I definitely Want to keep my contractor independence. I urge people on this sub forum to really educate yourself about the pros and cons of this bill passing. Like I said I think we all want to be paid more but being classified as employees has a lot of downsides and I think that is the wrong solution to what we want. What we should really be pushing for is better conditions as independent contractors. More like $70 a week I just started lyft today.

"Accidentally dropped off passenger as I picked them up, which in turned cancelled ride and broke my streak.",2,28.034420049198797,Lyft,"I picked up a passenger this morning and when he got in the car, I accidentally hit drop off and it cancelled the ride. I was already driving when I noticed and let the passenger know that the ride had accidentally cancelled. I still took him to his job (at least 20 mins away). This was my 2/3 streak ride($15 bonus), and I picked up a 3rd passenger afterwards and completed the streak but because I “cancelled” the 2nd ride, it broke the streak :( The guy was really nice and was worried that I wouldn’t get paid and was offering to pay me but I reassured him that I just have to contact lyft so they can fix the issue (also no street hails are allowed). He gave me his information, so that if lyft needs to contact him, they can. I sent an email about what had happened, with the requested info:

Time and date of ride
Pickup location
Passenger name
Time and address the ride actually ended 

and now they are saying because it was give-off platform, they can’t “issue any compensation because cancelled rides do not count toward your completed ride count, they can’t charge a rider for a ride that was cancelled and re-dispatched to another driver. The ride was not re-requested and not tracked in our system to automatically proceed to compensate.” and no bonus. So now I’m regretting not taking the money he offered me and upset that lyft is refusing to pay because would have been at least an extra $35 in my pocket. Anything else I can do to help get at least the payment for the ride or should I just drop it?",Gotta agree with Lyft on this one. You fucked up the ride. And how did that even happen? You started the ride before they got in? The app will ask you to confirm you dropped the passenger off so you had to actually hit the screen TWICE to fuck up the ride. I wouldn’t pay you either.

Is tip always expected? Will my rating go down if I don't?,14,28.05219782697658,Lyft,"I don't understand this county and I am new to this whole ride sharing thing so please, be kind.","Tipping is always appreciated. Just don't say you're going to tip in the app and don't. Some drivers rate down for not tipping.  I have done so, but mostly when combined with other factors. (A tip can make up for being late and slightly rude and taking me away from where other fares are.)

Tips are a reasonable expectation:  Lyft rides cost about half of a taxi ride and provide similar experience.   After expenses, the drivers generally make near minimum wage without tips. Always tip. Keep that 5 stars. As a driver and in several drivers groups. 

A vast majority of drivers will rate you low if you don’t cash tip/ immediately tip. 

Personally I don’t give a shit. 

As long as you don’t smell like the Black Plague and all of your bodily fluids stay INSIDE you and you’re not a complete douchebag. 5 ⭐️ As a driver, I don't expect a tip but it is always appreciated.


As a passenger: If you're not a shitty driver, present yourself decently, and are at least a little friendly you're going to get a tip from me.


Anyone who rates you low because you don't tip is an asshole. I'm going to give it to you straight, because I'm both a driver and a passenger. 

You don't *have* to tip. It's not expected like it is at restaurants, for example. However, drivers really don't make much money. That seems impossible, given the amount you pay for a ride, but assume your driver is only getting half of what you paid (sometimes it's less). Therefore, tips are always appreciated, and I always give them as a passenger unless something was demonstrably wrong with the driver or ride that was within the driver's control. 

Will you get downrated for not tipping? It's not something I do as a driver, though a tip can sometimes offset something I might have otherwise downrated for (a long stop, a passenger who drags a lot of dirt into the car forcing me to shut off and vacuum immediately, etc). Some drivers do downrate solely on the basis of tips though-- I'm not going to judge them for trying to find a way to earn a living when these companies are slashing our earnings, but it's not a philosophy I subscribe to. If I had to guess, I'd say that fewer than 50% of drivers do this, and fewer than 10% would give you a bad enough rating that you might have a problem accessing the service if it happened multiple times. 

Honestly, if the ride was good and you can afford it, please tip a dollar or two. It makes a big difference to us and adds up quickly. If there was something wrong with the ride that the driver did (unclean car, driver odor, multiple route mistakes), don't tip and mention the issue in the comment box-- that will make it easier to dispute a bad rating if you get one in retaliation. If you can't afford to tip, okay, just don't promise one to the driver on your way out of the car. From a driver, it's not expected (at least it *shouldn't* be), but always appreciated.  Now, if you're a passenger with a lot of needs, that appreciation can veer more towards the ""you really should've thrown a couple extra bucks my way..."" side.

If you make me wait the full 5 mins (or more) for pickup, if you ask to use my charger while I'm using it for my own phone, if you ask me to stop at a drive thru (never NEVER do this anyway), or if you need help with a bunch of heavy bags...you should probably tip something...even $1 is nice.  If not, I'll probably drop that 5star down to a 4 or even a 3 if you did anything else uncool in addition (like slamming my doors, yelling on your phone, etc etc). Yes I dont expect it but I do appreciate it for sure. I never give lower ratings to the pax cause of no tip..."
Quick question,11,28.07273023439778,Lyft,So I overheard a guy saying he used his friends information to sign up to drive for Lyft. He says he’s been driving for 6 months. Do people actually pay attention to the profile picture and who’s picking them up.  Or is it they just don’t care or notice?,"smart people do, some actually dont care. People who want to get abducted don't care lol. That's some sketchy shit. Yeah I know people that share accounts. But if Lyft/Uber finds out you automatically get deactivated. They don't care or notice. As long as they're both the same ethnicity and gender, the driver's picture could be too vague to discern one from the other. They will be good till the driver needs somthing from the hub, like an anual inspection, or they get an audit from your DOT which happens alot on lyft. Ive been hit with an audit over five times in the last year... Tell your friend if this happens they could possibly face jail time, becuase it will happen. I’m going go get hate with this, but oh well. 

There are some subsets of people who can get away with this.

They almost rely on it. 

They sit at the airport with their phone, their brothers phone, their cousins phone, and friends from their old country, phone from the old country and they wait in que. then they swap out with their brother and keep this con going. 

They tend to be groups who a white could have a hard time distinguishing from each other. Its when you pick up undercover Department of Transportation cops. They play you for a fool and then conduct a traffic stop, and verify everything about you and car and your lyft status, like getting pulled over for speeding basicly. Most people don't care if you look remotely similar to the individual's profile pic.  Ex. race would be more than enough

If your friend is black and you are black you should be good.  Asian and asian friends, should be okay."
lyft subbed ride challenge rather than rental rewards for lyft express drive,7,28.560345975138524,Lyft,after driving in lyft express drive for close to a year they started putting ride challenge bonus rather than rental rewards. i took a 100 hit for several weeks because i always hit the highest rental rewards of 95 rides.they have finally switched back to rental rewards. im out 300 bucks being the difference and they refuse to credit. frustrated!!!!! they said that when i went for the monthly inspection to renew that it opened a whole new contract and when that happens rental rewards are not offered. they opened a email ticket but keep changing their story so they dont have to pay the missing bonus. went to hub but they said since theres an open ticket on the issue they cant do anything. any suggestions????,"Wait what? Because there was anew contract there were no rental rewards? There's a new contract every in person renewal. Who told you that?

The hub can't help because there's an open ticket? That makes no sense.

Talk to the Express Drive Lyft reps. I've always had rental rewards. lyft express drive folks who gave me my rental said to contact the hub in atl which i did. when they looked at it they said its an open ticket so they can do nothing. lyft support over email is telling me the last inspection/renewal triggered a period of ride challenges with a higher ride committment and a lower bonus of 87 instead of rental rewards 175. ive been in lyft express drive 50 weeks, 47 were with rental rewards. this week im back on rental rewards. i really enjoy doing lyft but this has been frustrating and challenging trying to get this addressed.  maybe someone typed in something wrong but it seems to be a violation of the terms of lyfts express drive program. any suggestions on talking to someone at lyft on the phone regarding this???? they just dont seem equipped to handle a problem like this at the express drive locations so they referred me to the hub. If this isnt the sign to get out, dont know what is. thanks. it was a battery jump and they eventually replaced the battery, hertz credited the lyft account, lyft never saw it, finally i said to hertz give me the credit, which i checked today and monday is the 5-7 posting period. 

&#x200B;

just more evidence that theres some real disorganization. in fact when i went to hertz express drive they tried valiantly to rebook my rental reversing the 75 charge. it just never hit. those guys and the hub seemed like they genuinely wanna fix stuff. 

&#x200B;

but like you said maybe this rental reward failure to post is a sign to get the hell out. i genuinely enjoy doing it. 3k rides high rating, like everyone i suppose.

&#x200B;

In New York, you must drive to an area with demand before you can log on. If you decline a ride and you're in an area with low demand, you might be logged off as unavailable for rides until you drive to a higher demand area to get back on.

One minute video inside of the worst Lyft I’ve ever had,32,28.826665419605042,Lyft,Image,"At work, so no audio, but I've ridden in waaaaaaay dirtier vehicles.

Edit: so had a chance to listen: netiquette rule 1 - put a Not Safe for Work (NSFW) disclaimer on audio with such colorful language in the future thaaaaaaaanks.

What was so bad about the ride? Without context it seems like you're cherry picking the controversial/violent sounding part of the conversation to out a woman who I'm sure would have been much more buttoned up had she known the conversation was being recorded. Plus you were goading/encouraging her to carry on with the conversational thread rather than steer her away from w/ever made this ride ""the worst"". 

People get triggered by the mere thought of their ex after an ugly break. I'm the main offender when I mention or have mentioned to me my soon-to-be ex-wife's name much less a conversation surrounding that relationship.

Where's the cream filling? Still better than a cab? do ya live near da ghetto? lol Oh. I thought that was you talking to the driver. The driver was supposed to arrive to my pickup location in 7 minutes. Instead, after her sitting still at her location for over 5 minutes, and at least 2 wrong turns, she got to me in 20 minutes. 

She didn’t acknowledge my presence when I was about to get into the car, just continued talking on the phone, so much so that I thought maybe I was getting into the wrong car at first. 

The car was dirty, but not overly so. It smelled like latex balloons inside. 

The driver had a conversation on speaker phone, some of which is what was captured in the video.

The entire ride, she never acknowledged that there was another person in her car. She was on that phone call for the duration of the ride. 

Yes, I reported her to Lyft. I had to watch it a couple of times, but am I seeing and hearing  the driver having a phone conversation with someone else via speaker phone? The person making the video is not the other voice we hear, right?  
Okay, assuming that's what I'm seeing, I'm very sorry you had to experience that. that is unprofessional, inappropriate, inconsiderate, and borderline unsafe. I hope that you reported this driver to Lyft. Ol hood bitches This driver sucks.

That said, welcome to most drivers lives. Being involuntary forced into a speakerphone conversation is one of the circles of hell. 

At least this one was in English, the worst are 30-45 mins long, yelling at each other the whole time, in Spanish or Indian or Portuguese or whatever. Recording audio without consent, please make sure you're in a single party state otherwise you can be charged by this driver or their phone counterpart for wiretapping. 

That said, the driver should have much more respect for you, their car and themselves this is disgraceful. Took me a minute to realize it was a phone call. Wtf? Of course shes ""How are you?""

""Well, let me tell you what...""

Holup This is why I usually play Mozart and keep the conversation erudite."
"So, (idk if it has been going on for a awhile) I gave a ride a to passenger. The ride was paid through his insurance Medicare. The distance was 19.0 miles. The drive time was 43 mins. Then I realized Lyft keep a good chunk.So is this new? Only been driving for 4 months and only part-time.",27,28.86372560479023,Lyft,Image,"Well sort of new, they were more fair in the past. Since going public they have gone above and beyond looking for ways to skim more and more from the drivers. They deserve what happened in NYC and California. And you deserve to be fairly compensated. They could care less about the drivers. Mostly medicare rides are required to be NEMT certified, so they can be charged at a much higher rate. In the law this is actually the very reason the NEMT classification was created: to ensure Medicare patients were only using adequately equipped transportation services.

If Lyft is actually doing calls for medicare providers, someone's breaking some rules. Well those Medicaid and Medicare rides are all paid at a higher rate no matter whether they go 4 minutes down the road or 40 minutes down the road. It's all in the billing and coding.  Driver never gets what's paid out to rideshare. This is the new normal. Just wondering how you knew it was paid for through his Medicare? Didn't know Medicare paid for rides. Did the customer say or did it say in the app? That will be huge business if Lyft covers rides for Medicare. Are you in one of those markets that fucks drivers on their mileage? I'm retired so I only do it part time too. 
Here's a good one, now Lyft says we're being paid to go to pick up the customer. If that's true then how come we're still getting the same $2.89 fee for the short rides. Just More Lies. Oh those short base rides for Uber pay $3.13 I believe if you're interested. How can this be right? I would call them. Forget texting. Give them a call Is that a standard rate for a \~40 minute drive?  $20?

If so, that seems fair ... if Lyft is bringing in extra money ($40) for this ride, it may help them pay higher rates to drivers for all other ""normal"" rides across the service.

Or pay the CEO a larger bonus ... depends on how they use the money. Sounds good Start your own business and keep what you want."

You won’t hurt the motor using lower octane but power and gas mileage will suffer. If you have the 6 cylinder (not sure if they were still making those in 2013?) you can use regular unleaded.

"California passes AB5 effective Jan 1, 2020.",45,29.53870245666692,Lyft,"California has passed AB5, which would reclassify nearly all Gig workers in the state as employees. It will take effect Jan 1, 2020 and is expected to signed by the Governor shortly. 

https://gizmodo.com/gig-workers-win-1837883577","This seems like the kind of law that will be challenged in Federal Court and held up for years before it is allowed to go into effect. Here is a good article and podcast on what will happen and why it had to happen. Not rumors made up by the companies who screwed this up in the first place. These gig companies did this to themselves because of greed. They could care less about the drivers. 

https://entrecourier.com/2019/09/11/commentary-why-was-ab5-necessary-for-gig-delivery/ ""  They know.

These companies KNOW that contractors have no clue what BEING a contractor means. They know and they do nothing. There is no attempt to make sure that people understand what it means. They just have you sign off on a statement. They know and they do nothing.

Why?

Because if applicants understood that they would need commercial insurance to be covered in deliveries, they wouldn’t sign up.

If applicants understood that there is a very high probability that they make less than minimum wage (and most do without realizing it), there wouldn’t be enough drivers to fulfill the orders.

If those potential drivers understood the tax situation, if they understood that they really are running a business, that they really are completely on their own without any protection from the companies they are delivering for, if they truly comprehended how completely exposed and vulnerable they are, it would be impossible to get enough people to work for them.

And, if they really understood what being an independent contractor really was, then they would understand they weren’t employees and they couldn’t be manipulated into acting like employees.

These companies know that most contractors don’t understand the nature of being a contractor. And that’s the way they want it. They are willing to let the people who are making money for them be completely exposed and vulnerable just because if they did any different they’d either have to pay more for getting the work done or they wouldn’t be able to get enough workers.

Either way, it’s evil."" So I still don't see if this is good news or bad news... This really hurts drivers in big metro cities like sf. I can hit up to 30/hr, minus fuel thats about $25. Work when I want where I want. 

Strippers in San Francisco and the rest of the state endured a similar wave last year where they now had to be considered hourly employees working on commission off their dances. As a result nearly 200 dancers quit working, some of whom i assume went underground into escorting. They simply werent going to make the same amount of money with the autonomy that they once were able to. A famous strip club here in SF closed down because of a lack of dancers Welp, that's an expiration date on my time working for Lyft, then. It's been real, but as a part-time XL driver, knowing that I'll almost certainly lose the flexibility to drive when I want and take only the rides that I want means the job will lose virtually all its appeal once this bill is officially law. 

Will AB5 make this a better job for full-time drivers? Almost certainly. Is it better at the expense of part-time drivers, i.e. the vast majority of the workforce? I'll let the market be the judge. In the meantime, I'll enjoy another three months of extra income while I spool up my consulting company and see what happens.

Best of luck to all. The way I see it is this could be good or bad but the way things have been going we already have nothing to lose. I say this law passes and we see what happens but to let Uber and Lyft stay in control we see what that means. Rate cuts after rate cuts until we are working for free. I mean come on guys some states are .32c a mile how people are still driving is beyond logic there is no way you are making any money at that rate I don’t care what anyone says. So let this pass and I’m sure things will get better if not well then it is what it is but to leave things the way they are is just not right Being that the GIG economy is still growing this could very well harm new companies and keep them from working in California How sad. It was good while it lasted. This really sucks going to have to get a regular part time job again just to make ends meet. Thanks California for ruining it for many of us. So glad I live in Vegas. This shit would never pass here.

Edit: if this actually goes into effect then what's the point of the 10-99 federal tax form? What? Is that no longer valid in CA? What's the IRS gotta say about this? INB4 the bootlickers complain about being treated like actual people rather than disposable tools for venture capital"

I was denied a cancellation fee because...,17,29.90334366038166,Lyft,"First the rep said I wasn't close enough to pick up location, I mentioned I had screenshots showing otherwise, so he then said I tapped ""arrived"" too early.

What happens when there's no parking? I asked the rep that question and he basically said ""if you can't wait still for 5 minutes we're not able to charge the passenger, so you should cancel and move on, it's our policy"" The fuck? 

I'm handing out free first Uber rides to anyone who tells me they use Lyft from now on. Like it'll make a difference right lol","They've been doing this at least 2 years.

Wouldn't be surprised if they're gradually shrinking the box. Used to be 1000ft. In the last 2 days, I had 3 cancels as I'm at the place and no fees. Gree. Same.  I arrived at a gated complex 2 days ago coincidentally enough.  Pax wouldn't answer phone, so I parked outside the gate.  According to pin and map the Pax was probably 100yds on the other side of the gate.  They never arrived, even after I called again at the 5 min mark.  

Tried to hit no-show but app said I could either drive closer (ie. drive my car literally through a closed gate) or cancel and not get the no-show fee.  Called to complain and they said their system showed I drove away before cancelling.  Have it on dash cam that I parked and waited for almost 6 mins, and called 2x.  Lyft support ignored the whole ""gate"" thing and said it was my fault for not driving closer.  Brought it up several times, and each time they ignored the question and brought up something stupid and scripted like ""Oh, your rates are such and such"" and ""Oh, you have to drive to the pin on the map to get paid"" B.S. So you arrived, parked, called, no-showed, and didn't get a fee? They're probably trying to pull in the low-hanging fruit to increase profits (reduce losses). Making it harder to get a cancellation fee is one of those. If you arent within 2 houses of the pick up location then you probably arent close enough, just from a realistic standpoint of going where the map is telling you to go, even if that location is the leasing office of a large apartment complex. You one of those drivers that hides around the corner hoping to collect cancel fee over actually just giving the short rides? I mean... I cant blame you lol ive wanted to do the same thing honestly... 5$ should be our minimum fare as well as our cancel fee, to prevent the desire to do this. Drivers who collect cancel fees without actually trying to get pax are totally seen. The rate at which you cancel is seen and dealt with accordingly. Maybe drivers would be less likely to hide around the corner 800+ feet away from the pick up destination if they were not incentivized to do so. Basically, you took advantage of a good thing and they put you on a shorter leash because of it. I have never once not been issued a cancellation fee when it is due, i have been driving for 3 years. But i also do things like clicking arrive at the leasing office then immediately calling them because i know they arent there"
"A Minor Incident over a Year and a Half Ago Leads to Lyft Asking for $2,500 today?",37,29.934304308540842,Lyft,"Hello,

Regarding the Lyft Hertz Rental Program

Today I wake up to an unreasonable demand. If I wasn't somewhat familiar with this incident I'd chalk this up to spam. Over a year a half ago on the highway with a rider on board at 55-60 MPH I clipped an unavoidable road cone. By the time the ride was over I forgot it even happened. That morning, filling up on gas and wiping the car down I noticed the damage.

[Picture of Damage](https://imgur.com/I6hkhMX)

I thought the best course of action was to take full responsibility and immediately report it to Lyft Hertz. No hesitation, no sleep, I set up to return the vehicle and face the consequences. I wasn't thrilled about it but needed it behind me ASAP. I get to the hub, make the report and a Lyft Hertz representative looks the vehicle over. They deemed it so minor they offered me another vehicle on the spot and I took it.

I waited and waited for a bill and never got one. I honestly forgot about it until over a year and half later, this morning I get this...

[Lyft Initial Demand](https://imgur.com/Wv9FIli)

Several concerns

1. It's unreasonable
2. Unprofessional formatting
3. The redactions in red are broken images
4. Can't Google a connection with Lyft Hertz and Paragon Subrogation
5. The date was spot on (how I found the Picture of Damage)

I feel it's unreasonable because I can't believe the damage cost greater than 10%+ the total cost of the car (if it was brand new). The unprofessional formatting concerns me because how can you be in the business of asking for any amount of money and not get that right? The redactions in red link to something but I can't figure them out, they're broken. I googled several variations of everything in that letter and can't find any connections.

But the date was spot on and this concerns me.

Not sure what my next step should be but paying this in full without question is I feel unjustified. What are my options here?","I used to work for a collection law firm in Colorado. It is unheard of here (although different state laws may vary) to claim that an Initial Demand letter is valid simply because it was emailed. I don't see how that would be acceptable in any courtroom. Initial Demand letters in this state must be mailed. It's the only way to verify that it was delivered acceptably. If it was returned in the mail, we would then skip trace the consumer for a new address. But we would not be able to proceed with a lawsuit against a consumer unless the Initial Demand ""Stuck"" at the last known address for the consumer.

In addition, this email is filled with typographical errors and, in my opinion, is not enforceable under current FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) laws.  In my honest opinion, this seems to be some company who was able to obtain some type of information from one of the companies (Lyft or Hertz), and is trying to use it to scare you into paying money which you have no business paying. In addition, I would assume that you never received any collection notices in the mail, neither did you receive notice that this supposed ""debt"" is being sold to a third party, all of which are necessary in order to make this a legit debt that a debt-buying company could then pursue. 

DO NOT PAY THIS. I would just ignore this as this company is seemingly attempting to collect on an unenforceable debt. Don't pay them. Tell them it's an error, maybe don't respond at all.

IANAL - maybe call a lawyer about debt collections. Are you sure ""Lyft Hertz"" is a thing? They are two companies. And you should be dealing with the two companies who insure them. Lyft's insurance should be paying because you have pax. Hertz is the one who pays somebody for the repair. They or their insurance should be asking you for the deductible. And you should have a repair bill. Did you check with any of them? Sounds fishy. Ignore the email “Oh Lyft’s legal representative, 

I received an amateurish, typo ridden email that I figured was a result of another Lyft data breach - certainly not the professional work of any company/partner affiliated with Lyft. I destroyed that spam email immediately.” If you don't have photos you may be screwed. However if you haven't seen any paperwork for the repairs or seen that the repairs were done don't pay for it until you get some sort of actual proof. Ask to see the car. Is there any statute of limitations in your area There is something very fishy about the html for that email. Your gmail clipped the message because of the size of the html code, but it’s just text and not that much, so it shouldn’t have clipped. 

My guess is this is a fake and if you view the html of the email you’ll see a ton of junk in the code.

Source: I work for an email service provider [deleted] You had an accident. Hertz put a claim in and was paid. Now Lyft wants the deductible for the claim. 

Do you have anything from Hertz excusing the damage caused by your accident?

Ask for an itemization of the damage and repair. This will show you whether it's real or a scam. 

Once you have that, reach out to Lyft asking for the claim number and who submitted the claim. 

If you have that, then you know there was a repair for the damage. If they can't provide this, then move on and ignore. So many things about this letter makes it seem like it is definitely someone trying to scam you. Call Hertz and Lyft directly. Demand an explanation and invoice. If they can’t, ask to be mailed a notice that no debts were incurred due to the accident. If Hertz swapped your car, there should be a reason why listed? Working for Lyft you're lucky to be able to buy groceries. I wouldn't pay them a dime without some actual proof. You're have a right to know what you're paying for. Do you have any copies/documents of when you reported it to lyft hertz? if you do, submit copies to paragon with a letter to request more info about the claim and how you tried to resolve years ago Subrogation means the insurance company has settled with the vehicle's owner, now they're trying to go after you for the deductible, which is $2,500 when you're driving for Lyft.

Technically, you are on the hook for the deductible. Just tell lyft to fuck right off they have wasted more then 2500$ worth of our time in a month and they will never give us the earnings we deserve, so this should cover this damage and call it payback Pay the man."
Tipping etiquette for longer rides,7,29.94057745668899,Lyft,"For longer rides, say about 50 minutes, is tipping 20% of the fare still appropriate, or is a higher percentage expected?","That’s a great question.  Maybe the answer lies in this idea:  are you having them take you somewhere deserted or hopping (ride-wise)?   For example, in my city of Portland, the airport isn’t really that far away from quality neighborhood rides.  20% is kind and generous.  But in Denver....oof. 

Or, if you’re going to your far away suburban home after a Saturday night in the city, I’d toss a bit extra in.  Or if you’re taking one from New Jersey into NYC, it would be very kind to do so, since the drivers aren’t allowed to pick up NYC fares. For long rides %20 is appropriate. Less if the driver wasn't 5 stars. 7500% Half your fare+7 dollars You actually want to tip????  
I thought it was rare to get a tip from anyone from what I heard. I’d tip half the fare because the driver has to drive back empty. He didn’t have to take your trip but did it shows how appreciative you are of them."
Express Drive Question,13,30.034639956702787,Lyft,So I am planning to get a vehicle tomorrow to do express drive while I wait to hear back from some jobs. I was trying to make the most out of the service and was wondering if I could sign up for any other delivery services with the vehicle or would there be something stopping me?,"Dont do Express Drive because that car will own you and youll be burned on taxes. I think your problem is insurance.  I’d check carefully, but it seems likely the insurance covers your use for Lyft and personal use only.  Other commercial use would likely be excluded. No, one of the things they make you sign says you can’t do any other gig services (Uber, food delivery, etc) with the car. I don't think you can do anything else with an Express Drive car. But if it's only for a month, it's probably not worth it to sign up and do anything else.   


You'll probably make more money just doing Lyft 10+ hours a day without dealing with all the BS that comes with deliveries. Nope"
Driver rants about low tips after one month on the job,16,30.09840153077686,Lyft,Image,"I think we’ve all felt this way at one time or more. I’m just glad I have other stuff going on for income.  

I like the EBay comparison. I’ve also been lucky in my city. MSP is a big area and lots of rides. I would suggest trying Uber unless there are Lyft bonuses that make sense for you.  Just experiment. 

It only took a day for me to get set up with Uber as they require the same docs.

I’ve also found Uber pax to tip more and often.

Good luck everyone. One month, poor guy. It's not the PAX, it's Lyft - literally it's Lyft that is taking your money.  The PAX is paying what has been socially acceptable or 'market rates' for the fairs yet lyft & uber take 50% of that.  If AMZ did this to retailers did they would be out of business... If you want to make a lot of tips and this is what I do. Make it an experience more than just a service, this may be hard to hear but Lyft and Uber drivers are going to be automated away. And yeah it sucks you gotta keep this in mind that we only have this platform for a short time. For my car I have water (buy in bulk from Costco/Sam's club/BJ's) chargers (buy from wish www.wish.com/share/4608fhjjwy because no one cares if you spend a shit ton of money for chargers) I have an Nintendo switch in my car and I have three pro controllers for them I have Oreos that I buy at Walmart in the normal bags Because when it's three in the morning no one cares that other people have eaten them and you better have some type of music when your driving too because I hear from a lot of my pax that most of their other Lyft drivers have little to no music in their car you should create a playlist of songs that your pax like and have some songs that you like I drive 10 hours a day on the weekend nights and my tip to ride ratio is often times 50/50.

TLDR Invest in your business make it an experience No Jesse Pinkman, your service is not that valuable. If you want to make real money, go back to cooking meth. That guy doesn't get tips becuase hes a duchebag. Period."
"Left phone in Lyft, driver confirms but stopped responding",8,30.126943197454565,Lyft,"Hello, I left my phone in the Lyft in the middle of the night 8/31, realized immediately as I closed the door but he sped off. Three days later, the driver confirmed to Lyft that he had the phone but became unresponsive to Lyft messages. I had provided my roommates contact information Lyft originally, and then I reactivated my number on another phone and then provided that to Lyft again. Only relevant because the driver reached out to Lyft a final second time last Thursday to say he tried contacting (never left a voicemail/text) and my roommate got a call from a random number, who I have tried to call, text, and WhatsApp. The number hasn’t responded to even confirm it’s him, but it’s clear they blocked me on WhatsApp. 

Lyft is now recommending I escalate to authorities because they legally can not provide more information without a subpoena. Any customers have any luck with escalating to the authorities? 

It’s a shattered iPhone 5s — I cannot come up with non-creepy reason why he would want to keep it this long, so drivers please provide me some alternate feasible reasons that aren’t creepy? Totally understand just getting busy, but it really shouldn’t be so hard to just shoot a text to me or a note back to Lyft, one of his employers.","Ok. You asked if it’s about being creepy or not.  Most likely not. 

As a driver, I wish the driver would try at least a bit harder to contact you.  It makes us look bad when drivers don’t try a bit to help. 

That said, you stated that Lyft is our employer.  That is not true, and Lyft and Uber are currently spending much much money to try to make sure that remains the case. 

My best guess is that he doesn’t want to be troubled.  The return fee from each company is $15, which is generally not worth the hassle. Of course, I personally think he _shpuld_ still do it, but that it is a hassle is somewhat undeniable. 

My second best guess is that he might think he can get a better return on selling it.  The model may be old and the screen may be cracked, but it still might be worth something.  Or at least he might think it is.  While this reason isn’t creepy, it is crappy. 

I wish you weren’t having this experience.  Generally I find that these situations are where riders discover how little Uber or Lyft care about any of the humans on either side of the deal: the driver or the rider.    It doesn’t make them bad deals, necessarily.  But they do have this downside. Returning items is a hassle: usually not worth the $15 return fee. (And Lyft somehow ""forgot"" to pay me the last time I returned a lost item. Trying to get through to Lyft driver support is ALSO not worth $15.)  
That having been said: I will usually -- at the very least -- drop the phone off at the Lyft hub, because I know what a hassle it is to lose one's phone. Other drivers may have a different philosophy. Now, who knows what's going on in this driver's life. He may only drive on weekends, has another full-time job, and was about to leave on a week-long vacation. He may have been juggling a dozen other things in addition to trying to get a phone back to a passenger.  
He may try again, or he may feel that he's done his due diligence.  
I swore after the hassle of the last time somebody left a phone in my car that the next time I found a phone I was going to toss it straight into a dumpster. (But I swore that the time before that, too, and I didn't do it.)   
So, my philosophy is: I will do all I can to get your phone back to you if you leave it in my car, but please, please, PLEASE don't leave your stuff in my car.  
And, again: I can't speak for other drivers. At that point it's a stolen phone. Contact the authorities and use track my iphone. These posts pop up all the time. Just move on. You already got a new phone. Next time don’t forget your shitty phone or check well before you let them drive off. Money talks. I’m betting you might get a response if you offer a reward.  That is unless he already sold it. Cynical I know, but humanity sucks. Offer a reward. He/She may respond to the allmighty dollar. I'm like 99% sure that the reason is laziness."
Is there a way to get around having a drivers license from a different state?,1,30.213123753010123,Lyft,You’re supposed to have a license for the state you want to drive in. Any loopholes or hacks? I have a license just for a different state.,"It depends on the state you live in. So far I've found 3 other states I can drive in even though I'm signed up to drive in my home state. 

So you could sign up for the state your license is from and hope the state you live in now doesn't have a regulation that keeps you from driving with an out of state license."
Quit Lyft for a few months until yesterday in Twin Cities.,1,30.290751067835977,Lyft,"So after Lyft seemed to slow down lately I switched to Uber. Uber is fine and seemingly busier in the Twin Cities.  However, Lyft started the only daily bonus worth it to me this week so thought I would try it again. (25/5 rides and 15/3 rides) both rush hours.  

My immediate thought is only with the bonus is Lyft worth doing now. What say you?",I'd definitely do that if it was offered in my market. Seems like a quick way to make some extra cash.
PPZ Sent Me Into Proximity of a Tornado,4,30.320114493761903,Lyft,"I don't check for severe weather warnings in my area every time I go somewhere, because it's infrequent enough that it hasn't been a problem, but after this, I will think twice about navigating to a PPZ, especially not out to the agricultural part of town. 

This was at NW St. Helens Rd. and Salzman Rd. in Portland, OR, on Sunday, Sept. 8th, at 6:47pm, giving me no time to head back into the hill, before my Sauvie's Island farmer friend posted drone pictures of his freshly destroyed greenhouse and crops.

I doubt it was intentional, but then again, I'm always intrigued how it always sends me to a totally dead part of town, like ""here, I'll give you five bucks to get out of our way, for ten minutes. Maybe you'll see a tornado."" Then, I received a very specifically stern alert from emergency weather services, telling me to GTFO. lol, no one wants me around!

Tip or Wait Longer For Rides?,13,31.172984864154348,Lyft,"Drivers, do you rate riders who don’t tip 1 star?  Do you cancel or refuse riders who have lower ratings?","Haven't had to 1 star anyone yet. I imagine if someone was a complete rude asshole, that would warrant the lowest rating.
3 stars if you are so sloppy drunk you can't walk straight and I have to assist you to get into the car! Great you're not drinking and driving but I still don't want you in my car.

I will never pick anyone up under 4.80. It takes talent to get your rating down that low! For people who didn't tip after taking me far out of the city to the burbs or remote areas where I have to deadhead more than 30 minutes to get back, especially if they were on shared rides, I 3-star them because I don't want to lose money on them again.  I am a personal vehicle, not public transit.  They are only paying around $18 for a ride that would cost $50-$70 on the meter in a cab.  Exploiting my time and property and not showing any kind of appreciation or gratuity for subsidizing their lifestyle is flat out fucked, especially because I'm a professional, friendly and courteous driver.  It is literally the same thing as stiffing your wait staff at a restaurant. 

The rating hit from a 3-star isn't as severe as a 1-star so they aren't as likely to get kicked off for it but I want them to get the hint that they're doing something wrong (because Lyft doesn't share feedback with passengers unless their account is suspended) and for the next driver to see their lower rating as a warning.

I try to pass on anyone showing 4.7 or below for their rating because at that point, they have a history of being a problem and I don't want to risk a walking alcohol addiction putting me out of work until the detail shop opens and 3+ days of Lyft support hamsters struggling to pay me a cleaning fee. 1 star = anything that warrants a damage claim 
3 star = god awful smell I wish I was in a market where an $8 tip is considered low. Nah, worst I'd rate is a 3 and that's only if you needed help with bags, wanted to use my charger, it was a really long ride (like 20-30min+),  or were just an ass during the ride.  If you're difficult or have extra needs then you should probably tip something, anything.    
As for low ratings, I actually haven't ever seen anyone lower than a 4.8 in almost 2 years.  If it's maybe a 4.5 I'd reject it, but other than that I'm more likely to reject if it's far (Lyft likes to ask me to drive 20+ mins for 3 min rides) 1 star always for non-tippers. I ignore pings from riders below 5.0. I might take a 4.9 if it's slow, but never a 4.8. On Uber a 4.8 is normal. On Lyft it spells trouble.   


I do not rate passengers based on tips. I often 3-starred people who tip me in cash. Last night I 2-starred a woman who left an $8 tip.  My ratings are based strictly on whether I ever want to see you again or not."

It doesn't fit me well though so I don't like it. congrats on your 25 cent per mile jacket. a true warrior! ""no *refunds* or exchanges"" you paid for that? Can you pay rent with a jacket?

Not sure I want to wear it. Decent jacket though. Mine never showed up Is it pink? One day you’ll look back on this day with pride when Lyft has taken over the world. Or gone bankrupt. 5700 rides in < 2 years. No jacket here...... I donated mine to goodwill.  Fuck these feel good incentives Off topic here, how many rides till I get an amp? A free jacket great. I live in south Florida so id never wear it.   Plus I’m lazy ya only at 600+ rides.I saw one in the thrift store recently. It was actually pretty well

If you could change or suggest one thing about Lyft what would it be?,15,31.88649180860983,Lyft,If you could change or suggest something to change or add to Lyft what would it be?,"Raise the customer prices, so the drivers can get a fair share...

There is more than enough info provided to the Pax about our ETA...so no need to EVER make us wait 5 mins or more for you to come outside.  The 2 min warning literally tells you to head outside.  In the event there's inclement weather I'd understand, so for that reason it should be no more than 2 mins waiting before drivers can bail...and fuck having to call to remind/beg you to get outside.  After 2 mins, we should just got back to the old days of ""No Show"" and just drive off.  You think a cab or the bus would call if you're not there?   I once kept track of a Saturday evening in SoCal...28 rides, literally 17 had me wait between 3 and the full 5+ mins.  If you avg that out to 4 mins each, I spent 68 mins waiting at 10 cents/min.

My findings on Lyft from test driving new rates.,12,31.996179308620867,Lyft,"Is that you should Only drive Lyft at places where PPZ can popup or places where you can get a lot of $4ish fares for shortest minimum distances.  Driving for 9+ minutes to go get someone and then dropping them off didn't make much of any extra money for me.  Lyft claimed we are paid from moment we start driving to them, but I barely noticed anything extra.  I drove guys from Minneapolis to edge area of St. Paul event on the river and only saw $12, this used to pay $17 before rate slashes and this is after I was stuck in freeway with them for a while due to construction, so imagine how much less it would've been had freeway traffic been smoother.  So lesson here is get a full-time job to support your life instead of driving people to far places and being a ping pong that puts high miles on your car for low pay.  .35c isn't worth it unless maybe you are aiming to make a quick $25 from doing very short $4 rides or you know an event is letting out and PPZ can reach $10+. Basically just drive smart and just go offline, don't just keep driving for hours and hours because you will be wasting gas and time and putting on too much miles.  Use it for destination filter when you have to be somewhere so you can drive people headed that way.","Thanks for the update. In certain circumstances I can see it still being worth it, like with PPZs. But other than that, Uber looks much better. 

Been doing Uber this week, and just for shits and grins I’d flip on Lyft too. 9-10 Uber pings to 1 Lyft ping. What’s worse, they were all around my house! I’ve had a lot less empty miles, whereas Lyft would have been almost all empty. 

As a plus, I’ve noticed one big thing, there’s a difference in paxs. With Lyft, if things were going to be bad, it usually happened mid-ride. With Uber, though, the crap was from the get-go, making it easy to just say no and drive away. If you drive for xl make sure you specify only xl rides in the vehicle preference in the app. This trick makes me extra $$ Figured as much. The rate slash makes it not enough worth especially when it cost $.50 a mile just to maintain your car Lyft changed rates in my market as well. It sucks. I will only drive for them if there is a PPZ or some other unusual situation that clearly benefits me. I hate relying on Uber but hopefully Lyft will find this rate change doesn’t work. If it does Uber will likely follow. Lyft sucks. I turn on only Uber. I make way more on Uber these days than Lyft. Or, get a real job and ditch these pathetic losers."
Driver accidentally pressed Ride Complete button 2 miles before my stop,27,32.50314690121346,Lyft,"So the driver accidentally pressed the Ride Complete button 2 miles before my stop, then he made me get out of his car!!!! He apologized for the mistake, but insisted I get out!!!! I told him I've paid for the entire trip, please just take me to my destination. He refused, saying he had other riders in queue he now must get to. What is the appropriate way to handle this situation when this occurs??? Must happen more frequently than you think. It was an honest mistake by the driver but man was it immensely frustrating with no obvious remediation. Should the driver have continued on to my destination since I had paid in full and it was his mistake? Or was he in the right for demanding I leave the vehicle? (This was purely an honest mistake, fyi, I had not been mis-behaving or anything - I was completely sober and traveling alone and not talking - he wasn't trying to get me to leave his vehicle for any reason other than his honest mistake)

EDIT: He was playing with his phone at a stop light so he probably hit the wrong button accidentally. I think the thing that bothered me the most is he made me exit his vehicle, 2 miles from my destination, in the middle of nowhere!!!! I understand his insurance may have been voided once he clicked End Ride, but for the sake of human decency, is it proper to ask a human being who is behaving properly to exit your vehicle in the middle of nowhere because you accidentally clicked the End Ride button? He became irate and insisted I leave. I was afraid he might kill me so I politely left, stayed by myself in the middle of nowhere, and waited for another Lyft to arrive 10 minutes later to take me the final 2 miles. The second Lyft driver, as with most Lyft drivers, was very polite and understanding.","1 star and report. If you want to waste hours of your life, talk to the Lyft bots for a refund. No.  He’s a dumb fuck. What do you expect I video tape all my rides for security. If this happened to me I would pause to explain to you that this no longer is a paid ride on the Lyft platform. I would go offline and drive you to where you needed to be since my mistake is never your mistake. Same arrangement as driving any friend or family member anywhere. I'm a driver. I've hit the complete trip button early. Just bring them to the destination and contact support to have your pay updated He should continue to the destination and cancel everything else and go offline. But then he may be right because the insurance after the cancelation is in the grey area. And the waybill is incorrect.

You should report and get a refund. I had a guy accidentally cancel the ride and he thought I did it. I told him if I did it, you'd get a notification saying I did. I got a notification saying he did. I would have just taken you, what a dumb ass that driver was. Personally I would’ve taken you anyway. 

But you’re only actually paying for actual time and miles. If you were quoted say $30 for the full time you’ll get a small portion of that back. 

You can complain to Lyft and get a refund/ride credit. When I first started driving for Lyft I did this accidentally as well. It is because the screen switched from navigation to the Lyft screen during the ride. The issue was that my passenger lived on the other side of the freeway barrier oh, so it was fooled into thinking I was already there because I was literally right in front of his house however, I had to continue down the freeway and take the next exit and loop around. I learned from that mistake and now I simply switch immediately back to the navigation system. 100% I would have taken you the rest of the way on my dime. Leaving you stranded is unconscionable. I did this once. I just went off line and brought them to where they had to go. It was only another mile. But I wouldn’t make anyone get out. It's pretty hard to accidentally trigger a slider. Not sure what the hell he was thinking, it might have even been on purpose. One star and report as others have said. If I were crazy enough to do that it would be my fault and I'd still take you to your destination. Report him!!! its really hard to ""accidentally"" do it during the ride why would you even be interacting with the app whilst on a ride. It’s really hard to accidentally slide the ride complete button, he wanted to end the ride. Why he wanted to do so is unclear. 

Sometimes you can’t put up with a pax’s BS anymore. Usually it’s just better to be upfront with a passenger, “the way you are talking to me is unacceptable, I’m ending the ride here, I will be sending the video of our ride <points to rear facing camera>, to Uber/Lyft, get out.”

That said, if it really was an accident, there is a way he can finish the trip, drop you off and call Lyft to let them know he ended the ride early. 

It’s a huge pain in the ass, but if that’s what they did, it’s what they did and they should fix it or eat the unpaid miles. 2 miles would have only been cents added to his final payout for your ride.. I would have taken you.. like I mean youd have to give me directions.. but it wouldnt be any sweat off my back.. I had a guy last night request to go to the gas station but he didnt ask to be taken back, so he asked me can you take me here and bring me back? I said yes. I wasnt paying attention so when we got to the gas station I selected drop off, I had another ride in my que, so that popped up but I still took the guy back to his house.. because like what's the point in being an asshole due to my own error? I committed to the whole ride and you didnt do anything to warrant being kicked out.. so I personally wouldnt have had a problem finishing your ride.. I'm sorry you had a bad driver :( You only pay for time and distance in a Lyft. So you didn't pay for those last 2 miles, regardless.

Yes, the driver made a mistake, but once he ended the ride Lyft's insurance no longer covered him nor you in the event of an accident. With other riders in queue, he couldn't start a new ride with you either. It's an unfortunate mistake but he really didn't have any other option after he made it. Sounds like a piece of shit. When you have rides In queue that means the next ride you have to pick up starts as soon as you end the ride you just had. He didn’t want to miss out on the next rides cause sometimes it’s slow and you dont find rides for a long time so anything that goes back to back is a blessing. But still wrong on his part. He fucked up so it’s on his ass and he has to cancel all his rides In queue You aren't covered by Lyft's insurance at that point and continuing to transport you could be considered illegal. The responsible thing was to ask you to exit the vehicle. Drivers are independent contractors and are not slaves (or even employees).  The driver has the right to end or cancel the trip at any time (for any reason - other than discrimination or service animals) and ask you to vacate his property.  PERIOD.  When asked you MUST leave.  Any payment issues are between you and Lyft, NOT the driver.  Drivers do not have access to your payment method information and are not shown what you were quoted ever and are not even shown what you paid until after the ride has ended.  Drivers have no power to refund you.  It must go through Lyft who has that power. The driver is being exploited and so are you. He acted stupid but the stupidest are most exploitable.  Thanks for riding and being part of Lyft’s 2.16 billion revenue. Driver heartless irresponsible jerk. 1* and report him.  He absolutely should have driven onto your destination.  We all make mistakes and we should be responsible and do right thing.  Want better drivers and newer car?  Start upgrading your rides to XL and Lux. Most of us clean and disinfect our cars every day.  When time allows I usually give car a wipes dow inside and out during day.  Carry bottle of exterior and interior detail spray. My car looks like it was just washed for every new ride.  Inside wiped down in key area. Especially  the door handles.  We definitely treat our passengers must better and appreciate driving passengers who select more expensive rides.  Lyft has some offers out there for passengers who want to upgrade.  XL Blacks are 2015 and newer in my market. Miami or SFL are 2017 abs newer. Florida does not have state vehicle inspections.  Safety being key issue take the upgrade."

Lyft/Uber withholding key ride information such as ride distance and estimated pay kind of is a broken system,12,32.916584401227254,Lyft,"So I’m against the AB5 bill. I think it’s just a way for people to effectively break Uber/Lyft and voice all their concerns against these tech giants that they’ve been holding in for years. Everyone that drove for Uber/Lyft at some point in time agreed to everything they did/recieved. If Uber/Lyft didn’t pay at least close to what they should, no one would be wasting their time. I wouldn’t. If you can drive your car and in one day make $350, seems like a fair shake to me. As these mounting legal revolutions against Uber/Lyft are about to pass though, I can’t help but remark against these giants. How *can* they label us as independent contractors, yet withhold key ride information such as estimated pay and ride distance? It doesn’t happen very often but yesterday Lyft had me drive 10 miles for a minimum fare ride. You’d think a 28 billion dollar tech company would be able to treat one of their 5 star drivers a little bit better than that.","Lol at this guy who seems to think lyft/uber gove a shit about its drivers. Uber and Lyft think that there are certain rides drivers won't want if those details are given. Well maybe if they would pay better drivers would want them. More than $2 would be nice. People aren't stupid, most can do math, especially when money is involved. If you do a lot of short rides it can add up, but not if those rides pay only 2 fucking dollars. Then every driver will see them as a waste of time. So essentially they know that, and that is why they are hiding that information from you. Meanwhile, according to financial statements, Lyft spends on average $1.50 per ride on research and development, or something completely wasteful like that. There is plenty of room to increase the min fare for us, and if is the most important change they can make. I mean, imagine going through all the hard work of what it takes to get customers, then being too stupid to understand the simple economic fact that once you have gotten that customer,  the driver needs to make a certain minimum amount in order to survive let alone profit which is just as important. If they think $2 is that number, then why is there a huge lawsuit in their face that they now have to spend millions hoping it will go away? Those assholes fucked up in the common sense department, and now everyone is fucked. They're such stupid fucking punks, it's unbelievable just how God damned fucking dumb they are. The lawsuit SHOULD be to demand ride details, not change employment classification. But people are not that smart. I agree, we should get all the info and if we decline, there should be a "" how much would it take to get you to complete this ride"" popup with similar options to tipping, for instance an extra 2$ 5$ or 8$, or enter custom amount, then it cycles to the next driver and possibly back to you if it goes through all nearby drivers without being accepted and the passenger approves a higher rate. This is a little complicated but the only way I can think of to make far pickups fair.

orrrrrrrr of course the obvious equal pay per mile/min otw to pickup without slashing rates down. >  If Uber/Lyft ~~didn’t pay at least close to what they should~~ had an ethical business model, no one would be wasting their time. 

Your original sentence seemed to go against the spirit of your post, and I have a feeling people are fixated on that sentence and the fact that you're against the AB5 Bill, hence why you're getting downvoted. 

The bill is kind of a slap on the wrist for these companies, yes, but if no one stands up and says, ""Hey, you can't keep continuing to do this rate lowering, getting rid of Prime Time while keeping all the Prime Time for yourselves BS,"" then this will *not* stop and it *will* get worse. These companies are shooting themselves in the foot with these tactics because sooner or later, no one is going to drive for these rates, and then customers will bitch and leave, moving on to the next startup that treats its drivers/customers fairly. 

The only reason Uber/Lyft are fighting this bill is because they know people are starting to notice these shady business practices and are worried that their stock will tank and the shareholders will lose money, demanding an explanation which will ultimately end up in public quarterly financial reports. > you agreed to everything

What is this argument supposed to mean? I see it brought out all the time. You dont have a right to change something because you agreed to it initially? Then how would change ever be brought about? WHY dont we have the right to update the system? Why should we just sit there and take whatever they offer us? If you can change it from within, then fucking change it! A mule wrapped in a contradiction.  Against AB5, but also not content with the agreement he states every mule accepts.  Well what is it then?"
How to get tips,13,33.365126067893925,Lyft,"Is there a trick to getting tips? Like, I had 5 for 20 rides tonight. Seems low to me, but maybe it's not...?","Lyft riders for me, have been people of modest means, maybe that’s good. Give it time. At the end of every night I go through each trip, rate the passengers, and leave a nice note for each one (usually as simple as “thanks for being a great passenger!”). This almost always results in an increase in tips. As I posted. Previous week: 41% tip rate. 53% weekend tip rate. 70% XL tip rate. 15% commuter tip rate (the typical 9-5 crowd).

5 out of 20 is o-k, unless you were working 8pm-3am. That seems a bit low. You might get some late tips. My friend puts a few singles and a 5$ in his cup holder (nothing more than like 15$ total). Apparently, seeing the money encourages people to add to the pile. Don’t put too much in, obviously. 

But when I waitressed and stuff, we did that too. It promotes giving money, it shows you’ve already been given money, and it reminds them to tip. Start 1 starring nontippers to get them out of your customer pool and then don’t pick anyone up with a shitty rating because that means they won’t tip. I had a Lyft driver who wore a pin stripe suit. I asked why and he said he got better tips this way. Data point of one, but I gave him a bigger tip than normal. Get a job waiting tables I’ve been telling riders that lyft is charging surge and not passing it to drivers in almost 80%of their serviceable markets and have had like 100%more tips .... this is in protest not trying to get pity tips though but before I started doing this I would only get around 50% of ppl on average that would tip Offer them to take control of music, tell them to let you know if there's any way you can make their ride more comfortable, ask if there's a particular route they prefer.

E: spelling correction"
Lyft recently changed the App for all for us in canada I am not sure what this Orange section is?!! Its not Primetime! Anyone know ?,22,33.50793856790496,Lyft,Image,"Orange indicates maple syrup shortage and yellow indicates Kraft dinner shortage. Yea well I stopped working as much on lyft seeing how I havent gotten any primetime Ok lyft is charging the game on drivers and giving us ppz “personal power zones “ now and the is a demand map......   

Ok let me elaborate what’s really going on here. They are now charging surge for high demand areas and not paying the driver for them just a FYI fuck lyft for this and they are about to lose almost all their drivers that know better..... Ok we need to set the record straight here because you are getting A LOT of major disinformation. The yellow/orange heatmap simply shows demand AND NOTHING ELSE. Demand does not equal more rides, although in theory that would seem to be the best place to get them. Thing is if the driver pool in that area quadruples in response to this then you may very well not get ANY rides. Does that mean demand is low? NO, it just means that of all the places people are ordering the most rides, this is the place. 

People keep conflating this with surge (PPZ) and so on. The two couldnt be further from the truth. Surge/PPZ is a response to high demand PLUS lack of supply. It could surge in the orange zone OR it could surge out in the middle of nowhere because some house party just ended and 20 people are requesting rides. You may even see some yellow/orange out in the middle of nowhere near the house party that might quickly evolve into surge just to make sure everone  gets a ride quickly. 

Everyone seems to think that a high demand area will become a high surge area in a matter of time which is completely false. Then when nothing happens they think Lyft is somehow robbing them by withholding surge. IT'S ONLY GOING TO SURGE IF DEMAND HEAVILY OUTWEIGHS SUPPLY. The two MUST come together.

People have been complaining for years asking uber ""why dont you show us where all the drivers are? Why dont you show us where all the requests are coming from? How do I know where to drive? Why should I Just randomly canvass the city looking for rides?"" Uber and Lyft never revealed where rides are coming from because they dont want a bunch of drivers just setting up shop in key areas of the city. They need people spread around randomly so all those schmucks in various suburbs can get a ride without waiting 20 minutes for someone to leave the city to come get them, if they even leave at all. Keeping drivers in the dark was the only way to ensure driver sprawl. Lyft is basically saying fuck that and showing us demand areas anyway. Without Primetime, the colored sections on Lyft map tells me it is time to turn off Lyft driver mode and use Uber exclusively for awhile. When that happens sign off lyft and drive uber. The only reason I worked weekends and late nights was cause of bonuses and primetime , Lyft really knows how to abuse there drivers. I am also certain few that wont get any money if a rider makes mess in my car because of one previous claim that I was not able to show receipt for, so I for sure have to quit and get a real job even if it is working for dominos The orange area is where driver saturation is low and you won't wait as long for ride requests, but you don't get primetime until the square turns light pink.

They turn this on in markets where driver saturation is high enough in the market is set up in such a way that you're not going to see primetime very often. Also just turning this on in the first place will reduce the amount of prime time they pay out, because it lets drivers just seem which areas are busier in general.

They did this in Minneapolis a few months back. They did it in Phoenix two years ago. It's the beginning of a rapid decline. From this point forward you will make less and less on a month over month basis, until you can't even really break even on the lyft platform as a driver.

this is not personal power zones. It's the step right before personal power zones. Well thanks for letting me know Orange you glad?"

Rare Unicorn tip from pax as I was testing out new original Pink Primetime percentage.,16,33.77028810495304,Lyft,Image,"What is that? I'm sorry I'm a gig economy worker, any bill higher than a 5 is to rich for my blood. I did 10000+ rides uber/lyft only gotten 20$ tip 3 times and I either had to go through macdonold drive through or give them a boost after there car didnt start Had 4 drunk girls in their early-mid 20s each give me a $20 after their 8 min ride one night. They were very nice, like the kind of nice I hope my kids (that I'm never having) are like one day. Hope they're doing okie dokie with their lives. Wait. $20’is a unicorn tip? Seriously? I am a very occasional part timer and have received $20 tips on at least 6 different occasions. And much more on long runs. Wait... They brought back the  **original Primetime percentage?!**  
Please tell me this is true....  
Nice tip BTW. I got a 20$ tip last night! My first tip In 2 weeks of driving. And I just took him to the gas station and back. 23$ for 5 minutes of driving"
Chicago drivers needed for info,3,33.80230199384193,Lyft,"I'm planning on moving in to Chicago in a month, what's the average weekly or monthly income I can expect if I drive 10 hours a day?
Thanks","Used to be you could expect between $180-$220 on average for 10 hours of work here in Chicago.

Now you're lucky to make $120.

Most days are like today, a complete waste of time not even making minimum wage:  I was online for 5 hours today, between noon and 5pm, and only got 4 rides totaling less than $40.

Oh, and nearly no one tips in Chicago, so get ready to spend 10-15 minutes getting to the rider, another 15-20 minutes taking them 2 miles up the street then getting that whopping $2.25.  Enjoy your 1-star for not having free water bottles on hand.

Don't bother going to the burbs, it's literally operating at a loss, **always**; 15-30 minute drive to get to the pickup, pax will more often than not make you wait the entire 5 minutes, turns out they are round-tripping from their house to the 7-11 a quarter mile up the street. That might be your experience but mine is better, a 10 hr day should get you $250-300 the past 2 months was our summer slow down so $$$ is going to be different for everyone. This week is like any other time that we have a 3 day weekend the following week is always slow but next week should be back to normal. Been doing this for 5yrs got 19,915 rides it’s worth it if you have a strategy and learn the city. Also learn a little about the suburbs that will save you dead miles back to the city. Overall you can make money in this market i usually average $1750 in 6-7 days and 10-11 hrs a day plus I get my bonus from Lyft and I can make more than 2k in 60 hrs."
Why I can't keep a 90% acceptance rate,16,33.844095975323405,Lyft,"Beep beep beep!
New rider has been added to your queue!
*22 mins away
Aw hell naw
*Smashes decline so fast it knocks my phone off the magnet stand

Oh well.","Except declining queued rides doesn’t affect acceptance rate. I close my app for 30 seconds then it’ll be as if it never happened lol. 99 rate. I don't try for the 90% on Lyft because at least once a week, at a random time of the day or night, out of the blue I start getting bombarded with 20+ minute requests. Sometimes I get like 10 in a row and I have to go offline to make it stop.  


And that's how they get you. If you also doing uber it is hard because lyft is spoiling the app. I'm still trying to figure our how their math works for the 90%. I take just about every ride offered. The only ones I decline are the ones that are like ""few blocks behind me"" when I""m downtown Seattle. That 1 minute as the crow flies is really 9. But I get locked out and it takes like 7 rides to open up again. one would think the next acceptance would push back up, or two maybe. I'm not doing the math but like 7?"
Lyft remove pay without providing evidence?,36,33.9703922716335,Lyft,"Hello fellow Lyft Drivers. Recently received an email from u/Lyft support team claiming a passenger contacted them and reported that I ended the ride past the drop-off. They reviewed all my rides in the past and informed me they were removing $300+ from my pay because of similar reasons. When I responded asking for more information on the rides they claim I ended late, they responded that they were not allowed to share rider information. I don't know what to do because I don't remember any rides I've ended past the drop off (not sure why I would?) and have no protection against Lyft simply removing my pay without providing evidence. This feels very illegal from Lyfts end. Have any other drivers experienced something similar?","Find a law firm doing class action lawsuits against Lyft for something else,  Call them and ask them if they’re interested in representing you pro bono. Another reason to do the daily payout. I know they get the 50 cents but I'd rather that then get screwed in the ass like that. Yeah I think forcing you to work without pay is what they're doing here, it's blatantly illegal, and I would think illegal behavior wouldn't be subject to the arbitration agreement (correct me if I'm wrong, I've never done arbitration) Bro, they have your gps and the passenger gps the whole time. They can track when the passenger is in the car with you and when the passenger is not. You can also look at your ride history. I’m not saying you are lying but something here does not add up because $300 is like fucking 400 miles with the current rates. Wow this is really bad! We are already paid so little and it only gets worse over time. For them to come at you like this and not provide any evidence to back up the claim seems incredibly unfair, not to mention the terrible cheap PAX who will stoop to incredible levels to get out of paying for a ride.

If you can try to visit a hub and see if they can do anything to help you.

Just for further clarification, did they remove the pay from earnings that had yet to be paid out in the weely payout or did they just charge your card on file? If possible maybe if they charged your card you can dispute it with your bank? Go to your state labor board They just removed the pay from my upcoming weeks earnings. One complaint gets them to take 300 from you? Woah.... aaaaand i bet the complaining rider gets nothing back lol. Don't let them get away with it! That's messed up. Sorry man. That's deranged, and sounds a lot like wage theft (obligatory IANAL though). I imagine every time a passenger asked you to take their friend home, or they changed their destination and you just went there because you knew the way instead of having the pax update the destination, Lyft just claims it as ended late.

They also might be calculating any time YOU (the driver) manually changed the destination (as opposed to the pax doing it in their app). THAT is upsetting because many drivers manually update for pax that are lazy, or easily confused (dumb).

Now, I’ve heard stories of “nice” pax letting the driver drive around all night and make money as a generous “gift.” Ben Affleck did this for a driver. Could be Lyft going back and screwing you if that ever happened as well.

I doubt highly Lyft reimbursed anyone except the driver that complained. This is a shit move and I’m sorry it happened to you. Go to your State's public utilities commission, it's the one office that regulates ride-sharing, and file a complaint. I stopped letting it get over 100 for this exact reason. Scumbags taking money without due process, proper notification, any explanation or consideration. This is very illegal. This sounds like wage theft. $300 in fares or $300 in excess fares? They cant just outright take back the entirety of the amount you drove. But if they actually calculated you drove in excess of $300 combined then that is really suspicious. Honestly I dont even see how they could audit such a thing manually. You sure you are ending rides properly? Because this sounds like someone who literally never ends a ride without driving a few miles extra, and there have been drivers who say they do exactly that for ""a few extra bucks"" so it's not unheard of. How many rides do you have under your belt? This story could not possibly be any more fake There's no evidence you're wonderful and lyft is bad."
I am no longer receiving any kinda of Bonus as a driver in the canadian Market,8,34.070982549411276,Lyft,If anyone knows how to get them back or why they are gone please let me know,"Welcome to Lyft...it sucks I am not new driver but yes I can see this market being over saturated we don’t even get prime times anymore on Friday Saturday at 2 am I haven’t seen a bonus since 2017 If you want bonuses drive Uber. I haven't seen a bonus worth doing since July. There were some two weeks ago but it was do 5 rides get $10 between 7am and 8am. 

Im not about to wake up that early for that shit.

Are you a new driver? They take away incentives when your market is oversaturated. They probably dont need to incentivize when they litterally have to many drivers."
"I've come to the conclusion that it's easier to just tell passengers I don't have an aux cord. It's a 10-minute ride, it won't kill you to listen to the radio...",58,34.53659597534824,Lyft,,"I will never provide an aux cord anymore...  I never want to listen to 45 seconds of 12 different Drake songs again I've only ever had one pax that wanted to play his music so bad he used my Spotify on my phone to play an album. I downloaded one song and he still got a one star because he was an overall dick. I'm just gonna hook up a coin-op radio device. I actually don’t have an aux cord. My stereo has one USB input, and it’s for my phone. Fuck outta here with that shit. Mozart, Paganini, or Duke Ellington:

No one complains, but it does start conversations. I don't have an auxiliary cord, but I do let them connect to Bluetooth. That doesn't bother me, but TWICE in the last week I had passengers that wanted to *blast* their music. The first one asked every couple minutes for me to turn it up, before finally getting exasperated and saying, ""can you just turn it up as loud as it will go""?? That was a long 30 minute drive.

The second was in the front seat and he just cranked it up as loud as possible. I kept turning it down, subtly, from the steering wheel but he would crank it up again. That really irritated me. Super loud music kills my ears and in both cases there was an additional passenger in the car trying to have a conversation with me (or with their friend) and it was about impossible.

Prior to this week, no one has ever been super pushy about volume. It seemed so brazen and rude to me. Does anyone let passengers blast the music as loudly as they want? Do you think my passengers were being rude? “$5 cash upfront.” 

“Why?”

“Convenience fee”. I learned to just say no and it feels awesome. Ask if they've seen the movie Baby Driver. 

The only exception is when it's obviously a couple on a date. Those can be big tippers. 

Since I made this playlist though I went from having 1/10 pax ask for aux to less than 1/50. It's not foolproof, you will need to learn track names and skip some that are there for when there's no pax, but this music has made driving 100x more enjoyable for me. 

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLybZ30dw_g0w0QecvqNymbQklG6FomkeZ

Dude seriously you have to listen to this, give me that aux... wait... have I become the very thing I hate? Bruh I have JUST the song for this. 


https://youtu.be/E1i61PQLWlc Maybe back with the pink mustaches but today we've grown up. You get a comfortable safe ride from point a to point b. Nothing more or less. If you expect anything further pay for a private car. I have apple music with car play, I hit the button and they say play what ever.  Even songs I hate I sing along with it and them if they are. 

Keeps the peace and everyone's happy and I get tips.  Plus it makes for Intresting dash cam review. PAX: Do you have an aux jack?

Me: No.

PAX: *blank stare*

PAX: Are you sure...?

Me: ... I just tell them that it was stolen. They usually feel bad for me and might even tip me extra to ""buy"" another one. I also say the same thing about having an iPhone charger cuz I have an android and have no interest in wasting my money on a phone charger for a phone I don't have. I tell them that my car only has Bluetooth aux capabilities (it doesn't) and can only have one phone paired up at a time. That usually gets them to drop the subject and they'll stay complacent with listening to my Coke Escovedo/Lo-Fi Pandora stations.

If they ask for a radio station, I'll comply but if it's something I don't want to listen to, I'll hear one song and tell them it's not my cup of tea. If they fight me on it, I just turn off the music.

If they insist on using my phone for music, I'll use the excuse that I'm driving and can't really play DJ at the moment. If they ask to grab my phone, I say no one uses my phone but me. Shuts them up.

If they use their phones to play music over what I'm listening to, I'll stay quiet and just hit them with a shit rating.

If it escalates further beyond the aforementioned, I call them out on it and I very rarely ask them to get out but it has happened before.

People need to either use their headphones for their own music or just chill out and enjoy the vibes.

It's not their car to begin with. I've never had anyone ever ask for an aux before but if they did I'd let them I have Sirius/XM pic any station but country. Can’t listen to my boyfriend shot my father, got my sister pregnant and how can I miss you if you haven’t left yet.  So much for country!   Anything R&B because this is Philly and other than Billy Joel who started in Philly, Bon Jovi it Springsteen you are SOL.  No one connecting to my Bluetooth ever!  Not pairing phones to my audio system.  If you are a long ride on Lux Black or even just Lux you get an AUX cord, Water and anything else you might need or want!   
Don’t ever let someone connect to Your Bluetooth.  Charging cords- I got every thing you need and can charge your phone upto 50% in 30 minutes.  I only use Belkin Chargers and cords with dual voltage ad dual charging boards so your phone won’t be able to damage any of my usb ports or cla ports.   And no they may never use their own cord in my car.  Most are frayed or have dirty plugs, especially aux. [deleted] Lol well he had to choose an album and immediately give me my phone back so I could navigate. I have a Bluetooth adapter that plugs into the lighter ports. I’ve never had a pax ask for their music though but they probably could actually bump me off the Bluetooth it they wanted to lol. Imagine a six hundred pound dude singing in your ride for a half hour bc you had a aux cord. Lol. That's what happened to me once. I have a Bluetooth adapter in a lighter slot, but it’s in my center console so it’s unseen. I tell people that I don’t have a cord, and if they point out that my radio says Aux while my music is playing I tell them that I would need to pull over and park to switch the Bluetooth connection as it’s a safety feature. No one has ever insisted further. I do offer to change to a radio station of their choice if they can pick one or two specifically, but I’m not here to be your personal dj while I’m driving, and I am not interested in participating in anyone’s song ADD for a 7 minute ride. 

I’ve let some pax choose an artist or playlist on my Spotify if the ride is a bit longer and we are otherwise vining, but that isn’t a frequent thing. ""I need to listen to my playlist because it helps me focus while driving.""

It's true and it makes them stop. I ask for a radio station they may want to listen to.   Volume set unless I enjoy it. My car is so old, it's doesn't have an aux cord lol.  Problem solved :P.  Related is when people ask for a phone charger for a few mins ride.  I only have my charger for my iPhone, and I don't offer, but dude, 5 mins a charge while you're playing on your phone is going to get you no where! The new 2019 Jettas don't have an AUX jack. The one time I did it the drunks broke the aux port.  The little brats sometimes bring their in aux cord, so now I have a suburban with RCA inputs (much sturdier than the 3.5 mm jack) and I happily point to it and say sure knock yourself out.  The look of dismay when they realize they can't plug in is worth it every time. If you're in LA drive with 88.1 KJazz. Hardly got any complaints when I used to ride with it. I play the radio all the time. I got pandora prime but barely use it.ha Only one asked before I got one. Since then, nobody ever asks. Nobody ever asks for a charger, either. Pax only here (so far) ... would never even think about asking. WTF is wrong with people ?!   The world is off its axis. Thankfully my new car didn't come with an aux port 😌 I've never once been asked if they can take over the music. I do 7am -noon so is it more of a night passenger thing? Well he just looked up the album he wanted to listen to and pressed play since I needed the phone to navigate. 🤣 Great you’re a champion glad I wasted my time typing this and subsequently reading peoples responses Amuses me when drivers think Christian radio or rap are good choices on their part."
Changing phone number error,5,34.605299679051946,Lyft,I'm trying to change my Lyft US phone number but when I try to change it says Uh oh! Something went wrong updating the phone number. Please contact support to resolve this.,"They disabled the function so you can't change the number too often. My phone recently died. It was under warranty, but the replacement was going to take a full week to arrive. 

During that week I decided to use an old phone that I activated temporarily. I changed the phone number on the app, but when I got my permanent replacement phone the app wouldn't let me change it back.

Support said the number was a VoIP number (it wasn't). Eventually I had to go into the hub to get the issue resolved. Another example of Lyft making things harder than they should be. So maybe, I don’t know, contact Support? What do you think this sub can do for you that Lyft can’t? WTF?"

Drivers: do you see the destination before accepting? How do you feel about short rides?,16,34.70269551239632,Lyft,We expect Lyft in Vancouver BC soon and one thing I use cabs for is a <3.0km ride and I am wondering whether Lyft drivers would be OK with such. I am always a bit hesitant flagging a cab for such a short ride and even more so calling one... (If you are answering from Vancouver: I am at Beach and Chilco and I am riding to Burrard Skytrain. Yes there are buses to the SkyTrain but on a weekend it takes about three times as long to get there on a bus than with a car.),"I have no problem with short rides. Just remember that drivers make less than $3.00 USD on short rides, so you should be ready to go when the driver gets there, and don't waste any more of his time asking for chargers or aux cords or other special requests. Also if the driver deserves it and you can afford it, a tip is greatly appreciated. Please be ready.  Please have a tip ready.  It’s short. Maybe CAD 1-2? We do not see the destination before accepting. If its a minimum distance trip and you're not ready when I get there, just know I will 1 star you. Uber and Lyft make their money on short rides. They take most of the fare. If it weren't so, I wouldn't have any problem with them. Uber and Lyft are greedy companies who throw away millions on solving tomorrow's problems while forgetting about today's. You couldn't imagine bigger losers if you tried your absolute hardest. It's like they're trying to win the award for biggest losers on planet earth. Lyft gives drivers are given very vague destinations when we are considering taking a ride. We have 15 seconds to decide. If a driver has an acceptance rate of 90% or higher Lyft offers more details. By more details this means ""Rider is ""x"" amount of minutes away. Trip is ""x"" minutes away in ""y"" direction"" while this doesn't sound bad in text it can be very misleading.  12 minutes could translate to a 3 mile ride in heavy traffic or approximately 12 miles on the freeway.  I've had a ride where the distance traveled to the pickup (which most drivers aren't even paid for) seems in balance with the duration of the actual trip the passenger requested only to find out I've driven 23 miles for a 3 mile trip in a highly congested area. This fare from that trip didn't even cover the fuel I used to pick up pax Generally the only time chart rides are problematic is when there's a short ride out of a place that's very difficult or time-consuming to get to. I e done short rides out of airport queue and been placed back in front of queue on both Lyft and Uber.  Always get rid and usually because they have been canceled on they appreciate the ride and get best tips.  Plus Lyft gives you 60 minutes to return to front of que.  so can eat, Gil with gas, clean up car or take power nap. If it's a short ride with no tip then I give you 1-star to remove you from future matching and to flag you for other drivers that you are a waste of time. In some areas like mine, if you maintain 90% acceptance I get the time and direction. I don't mind short rides. I find very often if I take one, i'll get a long right after."
Not able to see passenger ratings or rate passengers anymore?,2,34.85310060498891,Lyft,"Is this a new or recent change? I took a break from driving for a few years, came back a few weeks ago and noticed this. I kind of like having one less thing to swipe through upon completing a ride. And I guess if I have a bad pax, I can just contact Lyft directly. Also I noticed I can't see user reviews or comments anymore? I used to love reading those. Always encouraging to go drive some more after reading a compliment. or knowing about an issue the pax might have, that I may have overlooked in my car.","Feedback emails come out once a week (Friday) with comments, if there are any. There’s a feedback tab on the app but idk if it updates immediately or not. 

To rate pax, you can either tap the star in the bottom right immediately after you finish a ride or you go to your ride history, select the ride, and hit rate passenger. You can rate up to 24 hours after the ride and it defaults to 5 stars if you don’t do anything in that window. 

Their ratings should pop up on incoming requests, but it’s tinier than it used to be.

Edit: I started driving 2 years ago and they’ve changed a bunch of things in that time, but none of these things are super recent."
"Possibly controversial: Anyone who calls or texts before I (driver) arrive with some variation of ""Please hurry, I'm running late"" will immediately be cancelled on.",45,35.03253347537308,Lyft,"The expectation seems to be that it's my responsibility to make up for their tardiness, and I need to drive like some kind of batshit crazy moron or else. I don't need that headache. Ever. Bother someone else. Seriously, from my experience there are many more drivers that enjoy a free pass to sideswipe traffic at dangerous speeds while running red lights.","Not as much controversial as pure common sense.  

Pax is doing you the favor of warning you of likely headaches to come.  Nope. The root of it is that a pax being punctual is their responsibility not yours to order the ride with enough time to spare. Anyone who starts demanding favors before you arrive is going to be nothing but trouble and not likely to tip. That or a variation of ""Where are you?""

One night had a passenger text ""Where are you"" when I was about 2 minutes out. I replied ""Almost there,"" then pulled off to the side and cancelled. I don't need that noise all up in my car. Let's not forget about Lyft adding rides to the queue without asking. Ive gotten so many angry riders calling me wondering where I am. ""Well, Susan, I am currently on a ride sitting in McDonalds drive thru queue with 12 cars in front of me during peak business hours with a rider who needs to buy McDonalds for her family of 8+. I'm sorry"" One morning rush (San Francisco) a pax messages me to be quickly hurry up. I pull up to their Bernal Heights home with them at the driveway with luggage. I pull up, and pop the trunk. They get in the and put their luggage on the seat next to them. I then get out to close the trunk and the pax yelled ""I'm going to miss my fucking flight"" I got back in and said yeah it appears so. I then cancel the ride and ask them to exit my vehicle. Pax went beserk swearing and yelling. I said, I have the number to SFPD and will call them if you do not exit the vehicle. They exited not before aggressively slamming the car door.

My emergency is not yours. It's morning rush and I don't need your shit, nor do I want to go to SFO and spend an hour in traffic getting back. I never understood that. Do people think drivers are just taking their sweet ass time because they want to? And that a text will magically make them get there faster? That's bs. I'm a pax and I always make sure I request the ride leaving me plenty of time for the driver to get to me (+time for getting lost in my crazy subdivision) and for the time to get to destination accounting for traffic. That's crazy some people tell you to hurry. Yup, just about every time... UNLESS, they are going to the airport... I've only ever called a Lyft driver once, and that was today right after she accepted the ride to make sure she was okay having my cats in her car since I was taking them to the vet. I didn't want her driving 15 minutes only to have to cancel because she was allergic or something. See if it weren't for the ratings and (false) report system I wouldn't mind those riders.   Heck I would even try to speed things up a bit (where reasonable).  But because any rider doing this is at least 10 times more likely to downrate me or lie and say I was intoxicated, the safe thing to do is to just cancel.  I've learned this the hard way. Ah, yes. And if you do happen to pick up this asshat, you can count on them making a complaint against you, no matter how you drive. 4+ years into this gig, I have a hard fast rule, text me or call me with anything outside of helping me find your dumb ass gets and immediate cancel. We are treated like the lowest class citizens on this world, lower than the lowest peons, thanks to the 2 rideshare shit shows we work for. I won't cancel  but I will not adjust my timeline. Moving as fast as legally possible is already my most profitable plan so....... Sorry, my flux capacitor got damaged by the last pax. Looks like I'm gonna get there when I get there. 

I don't ask for tips. Don't ask me to hurry. I must be real controversial then Oh god... sorry. A lack of preparation on their part does not make an emergency for us Against my better judgement, I picked up this person.  The ride included a stop at the liquor store, complaints that he wasn’t getting any air conditioning, a stop at the corner gas station and additional directions for his drop off because they were replacing the sidewalk in front of his building and he didn’t want to walk around the corner. That’s nice. Drivers NEVER answered the phone when I call or respond to any text. So welcome to the party pal. Give me a big cash tip before we leave and I’ll make it work. Fuck that, sport mode trips are the most fun trips. Bonus if they wet themselves in fear and you get a cleaning fee. Be the hero they deserve. Why cancel immediately? I know we’re all here to make money, but for instances like this, happiness is worth more than money. If you’re close, slow down. Turn down the wrong street and take side streets the rest of the way. Make it so *they* cancel. At least with that, it’s a 50/50 shot of getting a fee. 

When I first started, I got one pax like that. It was downtown, and after the “Where **ARE** you?!!?” text, I decided that now was a good time to explore the area. I was unfamiliar with some of the streets, and I had been meaning to check them out at some point, so I did. After about a half hour she finally cancelled. It was fun. go slower and have them cancel to get $5. \#iamverybadass Well you are a garbage human being."

Came back to Lyft to test out .35c a mile down from .68c and man I went a good distance and only made $4.46. Luckily good pax tipped $3 to save me.,17,35.667163105010985,Lyft,Image,"How can they pay you less than the depreciation rate on your car which is .60/mile? I'm sure a number of us are also wondering what Lyft's take from the ride was. I'm betting more than 4.46. Better keep driving before they go out of business :) $4.46???? Lyft would have me all fucked up with that amount?!!! SMH. I'm already stressed out with my current job financially speaking. They clearly lowered your base rate too So the reality is this gig is only good for short few mile distances and hopefully a tip, for very long distances you are at the mercy of the time rate while you hopefully got Primetime because mile is not enough to support you. Why are you still driving for them? Wait, they brought Prime Time back? I’m in LA, didn’t see anything like that today. 
We get 80 cents per mile but 12 cent per minute here. trash"
"Terrible Customers Service (not rhe drivers so much, the company)",1,35.73979041983684,Lyft,"It was always offputting there was no way to call for help with lyft, but I've been overcharged for a ride, a driver forgot to hit end ride at the end of my ten minute ride, jumping it up to $45 fee.

I've sent a help thing from the app, sent an email, even tried calling the headquarters (its a machine saying what everything else is lol). I'm pretty pissed, had to call my bank and they're filing a claim. They haven't responded back about the double charge either, wow.",If you are charged again the driver disputed it.

Lost my car keys in a lyft,29,36.01569319762565,Lyft,So I lost my car keys in a Lyft 2 days ago. I do not want to spend money on new ones until I hear from my driver. He has not responded. Lyft contacted him as well and he did not respond to them either. I wish I would just know even that he doesnt have them. Is there a reason why he wouldnt be responding? Any advice?,"What Lyft needs to do is have a postage paid envelope that you could just drop in the mail and be done with it. At least once per night, pax would leave keys, wallets, cellphones, other personal items and then call non-stop expecting me to stop everything im doing including my current ride so that i could drive back to their location and deliver it for free. Not gonna happen even with a minor fee which is shitty but you have to consider all angles. Ive spent hours returning things to people and simply couldnt take it anymore. 

My advice: keep trying, be real nice, offer $, and easy drop off. Most likely he doesn’t have them, count them as lost and go get new ones. 

Did you tip him well? 

I don’t care to return keys to people who left nothing beforehand. It’s a headache to deal with someone for $15. 

It’s usually at least an hour of wasted time, in the best case scenario. 

He probably told Lyft he didn’t have them, and the dumbasses there said, “well, just look for them and get back to us.”

He still didn’t and it’s not worth the time to keep telling them he still doesn’t. 

They are gone. 

Go buy new keys. The right thing to do is return your call and if he has them, your keys. 

However, not everyone has the same level of integrity and while this doesn't excuse their behavior, here are some reasons I've seen drivers provide for not engaging with lost items: 

- pax was rude
- pax didn't tip
- pax did something that specifically annoys them (wasn't ready and waiting, added stops, tried to break the rules with too many passengers or open containers, etc etc) 
- item wasn't found in the vehicle
- already dropped the item at a Lyft hub
- driver has been burned too many times with previous returns being complicated, costly and/or unappreciated

For example, if you didn't tip your driver that night, he may ignore you, expecting a similar disregard for his efforts. 

I hope you get them back! I would try Lyft again and tell them you can't reach the driver? As shitty as this might feel to you, time is money. The driver is going to spend 15-30 minutes just communicating about returning. Then there's arranging a meet. Even if you go to them it's going to cause lost time from driving or other things in life.

I would suggest finding out how much a new set of keys will set you back. Then do some soul searching as to what percentage of that you'd be willing to pay as a reward. Finally text the driver a short message saying something like, ""$75 reward for returning the keys""

Remember to think of this like loosing them on a train or bus. Most likely they're lost for good but if you're lucky they'll come back to you.

Best of luck. I hate it when passengers leave things in my car. Hate it. They always seem to realize that they've left it when I've signed off for the day, and I use a separate phone for Lyft than I do for my personal life simply because Lyft sometimes screws up and gives out my number to the passenger when I've told them not to do so. So I may not even see any messages about a left item until the next day. It's always more of a hassle than the $15 return fee is worth, and the last time Lyft ""forgot"" to even give me the fee. (Also not worth $15 to wait on hold and try to talk to somebody at Lyft about it -- 30 to 45 minutes on hold sometimes -- so I just wrote it off.)  
Another time I made an arrangement to get a cell phone back to a passenger at a set time and place, and -- after agreeing to it -- decided instead to use the ""Find My iPhone"" function to show up at my house at 6 a.m. and wake up my roommates (and me.) My roommates were rightly angry that someone essentially followed me to our home from my work and I moved out a couple of months later.  
As much as I hate it, though, I do understand how important things like wallets, keys, and cellphones are, so I will make an effort to get your items back to you. I don't understand why your driver has not given you any indication as to whether he has your keys or not. Maybe he's had worse experiences with lost items than I have. Still, even if he were to just lie and say he didn't have them, you'd know that you have to get new keys made.  
Keep reaching out to Lyft. They can pass on any messages you have for the driver. Ask him to leave them at the nearest police station even. After 24 hours, the kindness of strangers is past.
Like others said, offer a reward. Whatever you paid for your Uber ride, or say 20 bucks whichever is MORE not less. 
Offer to cash app, venmo, PayPal it in advance. 
You have to dangle a carrot if you want the mule to move.

Im going to guess that you tipped horribly in the app after the ride was over.
You already gave the driver enough reasons to not waste anymore of their time if you tipped less than 5-10 bucks at the end of the ride, before you realized you fucked up.
The fact the driver ignored Uber/Lyft calls and yours? Did you even tip at all? [deleted] No one said to stop what you are doing.  But when you have a break answer the passenger or reply to Lyft.  There’s enough craziness between sharpiegate, bedbugs , Hurricanes and mass shootings.  Do the right damn thing.  One day it might be you.  Paybacks are a biatch. I personally make a significant effort to return stuff and respond to pax promptly just for Karma's sake; however, passengers please understand your driver is under no obligation to solve this for you nor answerable to you and your demands after you have lost your possessions.  The reasons for no response or resistance from your driver are immaterial.  If the driver justifiably declines to interrupt his or her life and income flow to fix it for you, you are S.O.L.

Sorry if this is curt but a steady stream of pax right here need to realize that this is no different than losing shit in any public place such as a bus or a restaurant.  It is not the waiter's, nor the bus driver's, nor my responsibility that you lost your stuff even if you think you are sure I have them.
 
You no longer have your keys because you lost them.  My advice is read the TOS regarding lost items that you already agreed to and take personal responsibility moving forward. As a driver, I do not feel sorry for you. It is not our job to babysit millenial crybabies who cannot manage to keep their belongings in their own pockets. Grow TF up, get a new set of keys and learn to protect what is yours. Or just have mommy and daddy ride everywhere with your baby ass. I am tired of lost phones, keys, wallets etc. I dump any found items off the local bridge and send them securely and permanently to Davy Jones locker. How hard is it to answer someone. Lyft should pause the account till driver responds.   It makes rest of us look bad.  It’s just wrong.  I returned a wallet with $520 bucks, credit cards, drivers license and pax hadn’t even reported the lost. He just heard stories and figured he wasn’t getting it back.  Additionally, he represents several Rap artist very well know in Philly.  The benefits for doing right thing have been very rewarding.  I had no idea who it was when I contacted this person who is an attorney.   So do the right things and good things will happen."
Oddest Lyft Ride Ever!,19,36.030415419861676,Lyft,"I guess I've been mostly lucky, but I would have to say yesterday was one of the worst rides I've had.  It was an airport pick-up at about 6:30 in the morning.

First, there was a distinct smell of what seemed like cigarette smoke in the car.  This definitely exacerbated my sinus issues and cold and headache from the redeye flight that I took.

Second, leaving IAH he either cut off a guy or was cut off and called the other driver a n---er, but then quickly apologized as that other driver sped past us.

Third, he texted a more than a few times (at least three) and made a call to his 16 yo daughter warning her of post Labor Day traffic to which she responded there is traffic every weekday. Also showed pic of son and daughter which I assumed was ploy for bigger tip.  There was a hard brake slam due to the texting also.

Fourth, he kept bragging and would not shut up about how he was a great driver and taking the best and fastest route of highway 59 (hov) to the southwest side of Houston. He also nearly missed my exit (crossed 4 lanes) an then he complained about how should have told him about taking Beltway 8 since it would have been faster and how I was unclear on my final destination (home) and the Lyft app does not show final destination on pick-up.

Lastly, he continually made just plain weird racial comments.  He was from Sri Lanka and the concentration of  apartment between 610 and BW8 are decreasing property values and wondered if we lived in an apartment as he dropped us off (since we live in house adjacent to apartments) and that living in a Chinese neighborhood (which we do) is good. He also said I looked Mexican (which I am not).

He got us home in 50 minutes for $43 plus $8 tip which is $30 cheaper than can fare without tip.  However, I wonder if it was worth it considering the crappy level of service and safety.","You got lucky and ive been 1 starred for far less. I’m a driver. Use of the N word and texting while driving are inexcusable. 1-star and report. And consider reporting to your city if it’s a regulated one. Why would you tip a guy whose car stank, drove like shit and used the nword? 1 Star and report in comment box. 

Should not be a driver Not directly relevant, but I used Lyft all through my trip to NYC in early July other than one issue where he did not pick up (near Central Park) due 50% off rides.

However, this was my third time (and probably last) using Lyft at IAH. The first time I used, the driver missed the international arrivals exit twice and then gave up. The second driver had the same issue and I gave up and ordered an Uber who showed promptly. This is why ratings -- with details -- are so important. Lyft does not know that this guy is driving like this if you don't tell them. He is an atypical driver, and those of us drivers who would never text while driving or use racial slurs or really any abusive language if a passenger is in the car want him off the road, too. Let him do Postmates. I started reading this currently in a smoke smelling car leaving IAH. Not same driver though All bullshit aside, you got home didn't you? That's the 1 and only responsibility as a driver. Get the passenger from A to B safely. You sound like you may be a bit controlling in all honesty, he didn't drive to your standards but in reality, it is his car and he can drive as he wishes. All said and done though, you did end up getting home which is the main goal here. He's a bad driver and politically incorrect ... I would report the safety and anything else or at least leave a comment.

But old habits die hard even if he immigrated 10 or 20 years ago. Everybody looks up to America for the biggest and best melting pot. But still, we elected Trump. The other countries have no chance. And you have to see how the other people drive in their home countries to survive."

I help with luggage to prevent bumper paint damage. The rest is pretty valid. No I don’t think so. After 2.5 years you have gained the experience to know what works for you and don’t let PAX ruin your day. 

I am just shy of 6 months and definitely very burned out from doing this, couldn’t imagine 2.5 yrs. Hopefully you have had a few breaks or vacations during that time, if not please take one soon. Tolls are reimbursed and on the very rare chance it doesn’t catch you submit a fare revision request for the toll. 

Refusing hospital pick ups? Yeah that’s a dick move, feel free to cancel if they don’t look safe to ride when you arrive. But someone going to visit their injured or sick loved one? Ouch. I can only hope you learned all of this stuff in less than a year I almost went to a prison once. Her mom or wife told me too early and spoiled the fun."
Possible exploit or bug?,4,36.661480234698566,Lyft,"I was recently at SFO, and requested a shared ride which got confirmed and had one other rider. With a 7 minute ETA to pickup, the driver was, according to the map, sitting in a parking lot for 15 minutes. The other passenger stop appearing on the app, I’m not sure if that’s due to a completed ride or cancellation. After calling him twice with no answer, he began to drive on the road and then back into the parking lot. With more waiting, this forced me to cancel the ride for a $5. 

Is beginning the path to pickup and then not arriving what forced me to pay a cancellation fee? Is this a driver exploit, or just a bug with the app that maybe he was not alerted? Thank you.","Not sure about SFO but at LAX we are not allowed to make multiple pickups (according to airport rules) despite the fact that lyft doesn’t seem to care, as I have had shared ride requests from airport riders. I did it once, picked up two different PAX before I learned of that rule and now after learning about it won’t make the same mistake again. You don't know and care about what the driver does. You should have the updated ETA when the last rider was gone. If the driver doesn't arrive by then, you can cancel and get back the fee one way or the other. You can cancel earlier for ""not making progress"" but that's not 100% certain for free. Either way call Lyft and complain. You will get a refund and they will get deactivated eventually for doing this."
Challenging Lyft’s decision,4,36.768957086550415,Lyft,"Hello! I’ve been driving for uber for about a month now and haven’t really had any problems. However it would be nice to be able to ride for both. Unfortunately when I signed up for Lyft last month they denied me because of a pretty big speeding ticket I had in nov 2016 and said it’s against their policy since it’s within the past 3 years. So I was wondering if anyone has challenged Lyft’s decision or if they have ever reapplies after the waiting period?  My plan was to just reapply in November since the ticket would technically be more than 3 years ago at that point.

Best Lyft passenger ever,37,36.929385327304956,Lyft,Image,"yeah, I'd have dropped it off at a police station 20
miles away Sooo, the driver somehow stole the wallet from the passenger while driving? Makes perfect sense. Passenger must have dropped it after handing over a huge cash tip. I’d personally ship it to a forwarding address in the UK that then ships it back to the local LYFT hub Too bad texting the pax after ending the trip doesn’t go through...calling bullshit on this or you just didn’t want to show the automated “couldn’t deliver” text What wallet? That's the appropriate response. Unless it's the one that says ""Bad Motherfu*ker"" on it. Then you should probably return it. That will get mailed to Lyft hub quicker than hell. Proper response be I mailed your wallet you forgot, bless your heart. to everyone claiming ""impossible"" - pay attention to your lyft texts. You're getting passenger texts from two numbers, and the two of them work differently.

One of their forwarding numbers always comes from the most recent passenger, and this one allows two-way conversations. It doesn't expire after some arbitrary 15 minute timeline, try it.

The other forwarding number is for all previous passengers, and any passenger who had you as their last driver can use it. This one doesn't forward back from you, since from your side it's an alias to all passengers who had you as their last driver. This is the one that bounces with the ""we couldn't deliver your message"" notification.

So yes, when you sign off for the night there is exactly one passenger who you can text back, five hours later.

Also like many other things in this business, it might be set up differently from region to region.

I've had this kind of thing happen, so, to me, seems plausible. How did you steal his wallet out of his pants while you were driving with your hands on the steering wheel?  Impressive! It would be too bad if guy had to catch a flight. No ID NO fly.  
Seriously the text before the nasty message and than ur later text are questionable. Previous poster about timelines raises excellent point. Did you delete a bunch of the guy’s messages before this? Seems very random he’d fly off the handle at first pass and it’s even more suspect you had to explain you just woke up and knew exactly that he was referring to his wallet. 

I don’t really approve of the dude wigging out, but his fear of worst case scenario probably got the best of him. I feel it’s *somewhat* understandable he freaked out. 

This post is a sham tho imo. lol. i would like to see the rest of this conversation. ? Typical female."
Lyft Inspection - Electronic Submission (Jiffy Lube),1,36.97080893841606,Lyft,"Sooooo I went to do the annual inspection today.  First off, it was free this time as opposed to $20 (I went to the same location the last three years and paid $20) so nice on that front, but strange thing: they had me scan a QR code with my phone camera which opened the Lyft app with a new inspection registration form.  Inspection went fine, but they told me that they don’t need the paper form and now all the results are sent in electronically.  Anyone else encounter this?

"Lyft Smart Savings Plan, is it worth it while it's cheap?",3,37.11639921620488,Lyft,"Just got an email about Lyft's smart savings plan being offered for $0.99 for a few days, and would last one month before reverting to the normal $14.99.  the $14.99 price tag definitely isn't worth it as I mainly take uber (they are usually less than $.50 more expensive, but I have a higher rewards tier and those $5 coupons, and flexible cancellations are really worth spending that few cents more for me).  but at $0.99 it sounds like a good thing to get 10% off consistently for the month (I take at least 3-4 rides each week right now on days where I'm running late waking up and need to get to class faster than the bus can get me there).  

Anyone have any experience using this plan thing?  is it difficult to cancel when you are ready to end it (so I don't pay the crazy $14.99 price next month)?","For the 15$, 10% (*bullshit*) savings plan to be valuable you must take 10 rides at 15$ a pop, just to get your money back.

Does Lyft even look at profile pics ffs. I'll pass on this one...,28,37.50061217917888,Lyft,Image,"at least you know who your rider is on the right. The folks with the blank or unidentifiable pics love to get mad when you wont tell them who the ride is for. Eh.  I mean there are bigger problems with Lyft outside of a riders photograph.  

The fact that you passed based on this picture is rather discriminative in my opinion. Picture looks like a Grindr pic but... It's not enough for me to reject as a ride honestly. I’d be pissed about the round trip for Dontal. Is this Pontiac, MI? I literally turn my app off and drive 20 minutes south every time I get sent up to Pontiac. Worst place to drive... My guess would be Eras’ trip was a better ride overall. I’m curious about why you’re turning it down.

I mean, I’ve got my theory, but I want to hear your rationale. My pic is my dog. I've had several drivers ask ""awww wheres the dog?!"" When I get in haha

I wish he was good enough to sit outside so when the car pulled up it's just a dog outside waiting. Theras his penis down there! Not for riders. Why? No one would use their service if they had to be scanned and reviewed and wait days to get their photos and information approved like drivers have to I bet you're a blast at parties. Just let people fly their freak flags. It doesn't change your life at all. More for me. Why? Y ahora que es ? Good ole Pontiac Lol wow I rejected every ride that has a stop.  9 times out of ten they want you to wait outside for them.  Ain't doin it."
iPad,8,37.66991773473444,Lyft,"Hey guys, 

I broke my phone but I need some cash - do you think it would be weird if I used an iPad or has anyone use their iPad to drive for Lyft before? Any issues with the app/ anything I look out for...","You need one of the models with GPS, but assuming you do, it should work. The best mount is paper clips to hook into the vents. Then hang the ipad case with the ipad with a wire and or steel straw. That will cover your backup camera screen but you can flip the ipad up. I’ve always exclusively used an iPad. It works fine. You won't  be able to call the passenger before cancelling or at all. That is thr only downside."
Is Lyft slowly and slowly getting pricier?,11,37.77012606807881,Lyft,It seems so. Better than a taxi or Uber but not like it was. What gives!?,"Lyft is a public company now. Their only allegiance is to investors. They are raising the price and keeping just over half the money. Every drivers market I see is lowering driver pay so they may be doing that and keeping the extra from both ends. in Sacramento they were always more than Uber so its hard to say. Seems like ride prices have gone up but as a driver I was lucky to ever see more than $3 from a local ride. I think so. A recent check for the same ride on both apps showed Lyft to be about $1 pricier (on a 2 mile ride).

I guess they have to subsidize all those subscriptions, non life-threatening medical transportation, dealership rides, etc, somehow. They are squeezing drivers (hard) and passengers (less hard) in order to turn a profit... YES and not benefiting the drivers at all.    

The board gotta pay those shareholders an increasing amount every quarter or get replaced.      

The end is coming. you should download as many rideshare applications as possible so the algorithm knows you have options and it will offer you lower prices. But it is usually the most expensive in my area are regardless. Yeah which makes it harder for people to justify giving tips :( They have been dropping rates.  If anything, prices are going up in your area because there are faaaaaaar less drivers on the road (since they aren't getting paid enough) and thus you're paying surge pricing (which Lyft keeps and doesn't pay to the drivers).

You can check the Play Store and Apple Store to check the driver app usage stats trend to confirm, it looks like a fucking cliff this year."
"Lyft driver points to building says we’re here let’s me out, find out I’m over 800ft away and have to walk up a 45d slope with an injured knee, why did he do that to me Seattle?",15,37.779176994004736,Lyft,,"Obviously he was a cruel bastard that wanted to see an injured passenger crawl in agony.

Or, he could have been following the GPS and dropped you off at the pin. Google maps isn't 100% accurate. The number of times the GPS has claimed a dropoff point is in the middle of a dark alley is down right laughable. Usually the passengers laugh with me. ""According to the GPS, that dumpster over there is the bar we're looking for."" The GPS might have actually indicated he was there 800' is really not that far. It's hard to say was there not a lower entrance to the building?

 Sometimes as a passenger you have to be assertive and let them know you need to be dropped off in a specific location most drivers are OK with that.

 Did you communicate with your driver that you have a bad knee and you need to be dropped off at a specific location? Because 45 degrees slope is undrivable by any vehicle in the world. As a Seattle driver, I always ask exactly where to drop off people downtown. It loves to send me down alleys, to the wrong entrances of buildings, or once today down 5th avenue against the one-way. I gets really mixed up between 5th and Western from Yesler to Virginia. Be assertive and tell them ""the gps might be off, can you go here instead?"" Can't speak for every driver, but I will go to where it's safest for us both as close as I can to your real spot. Because that’s where the destination you entered was. Because you get what you pay for... want better service? Pay for a premium ride or even take a taxi. 

Rideshare is designed to take you from point A to point B that being said the people that are doing it are not trained or even care enough to make sure that you're being dropped off in the right spot, their focus is just getting to the next ride because distance pays more. 

Also the way the GPS works is when you pin a single building the drivers just going to follow the line to the building that's why he said that. Your drivers a dick.

Lyft driver asked me for spare cash to eat at McDonald’s at end of trip.,40,37.80205893846021,Lyft,"So at the end of this trip (fare paid by my CC), this driver asks me if I have spare cash because he’s very hungry and wants to eat at McDonald’s. I felt bad and gave him $4. Later, I realized that McDonald’s also accepts debit and credit cards.

Was I scammed?","If you give money, no need to go around talking about your charity; it is no longer charity when you have a need to talk about it.  If you feel that you were scammed, then so be it.  If you think the driver was really hungry, and had no cash to purchase food for themselves, then you helped that person, then so be it.

Let it be, scammed or a helping hand... No. You weren’t scammed. The driver doesn’t get paid until the end of the week and is likely desperately poor.  

You also got a view into how poorly Lyft actually pays its drivers. Jeez, who said that he’s using  express drive car from Lyft. Maybe he was super broke and just spend all money on gas and doesn’t have any for food. And that very nice passenger just gave him $4 for food. 
Everyone knows that McD accepts CCs. 
He probably didn’t have any money at all. I'd report him to Lyft for begging. Unprofessional. If he was using the rental car he was surely telling the truth as none of the money goes to Express drivers until their driving pays off the car first. 

Edit: I used to be an express driver however I never went so low as to openly ask but I always prayed for a cash tip in those desperate times lol Scammed? How? He gave a sob story and asked for a tip basically. You gave it to them. You could have refused. You gave them $4. All of this is hardly a scam. Nobody actually knows the driver's financial situation, or if he's even an Express driver.

He might have been broke, or he might have been a scammer with no shame. 

If you're going to give someone money, do it and move on. Don't go online to complain about your fecklessness. For just 63 cents a day you’ll fill empty stomachs with nutritious food—and save drivers' lives.

WHAT THE FRACK!?! Later you realized a chain restaurant takes cards? I had something similar happened i invited my driver to a barbecue party i was going to. He gladly accepted. We get paid poorly. I wouldn’t ever do this but some people just need the help Anybody that is dumb enough to use express drive deserves what's coming to them.

Paying over a $1000 for a rental every month is insane.

 But he might not have had any money because of this on a card or otherwise Express is only $24 a week if you drive 115 rides a week. What’s this $1000 nonsense y’all talking about. Yep. Although most of the whiney “poor me” drivers on this sub will be defending the “exploited” mistreated driver."

If someone did get access to your account hopefully they will be nice and null the charge, if not, just pay it and consider it an inexpensive lesson in cybersecurity. Pay them for services rendered?

Your average per ride is about $1.50 higher then mine, but Lyft's average take is almost $2.50 higher then mine. I am indeed infuriated, and also baffled at how bad this ratio is.  It’s the worst I’ve seen. Took about 45 minutes. What's up with those fees though???? How are you not actually fucking infuriated by that? You did all the work. You used your own fucking gas. Fuck that shit. Delete that app. Dude you need to find another gig.  That’s horrible.  I’m over 30 and Lyft is just below 8 or 25% on my last 100 rides.

So Lyft is doing away with the accelerated rewards program. Does anyone know if this means that they won’t be giving out the Amps anymore once you give 250 rides? Hope not because I’m not far from achieving gold status 😡,5,38.20328579034794,Lyft,Image,"In my area there are zero bonuses, challenges, PPZs, PT, guarantees, and now rewards. Add to this lot - rate cuts. It's obvious Lyft is eliminating extras. They're trimming the fat. As far as I know there have been no announcements regarding a new rewards program except for what's on their website: ""*We're launching a new rewards program and will have more details when it’s available for you.""*   


I could be wrong, but given Lyft's track record, I don't expect to see Amps or a rewards program any time soon. I also wouldn't be surprised that if Amps return as a reward, that the requirements will increase significantly.  


Just buy one for $20-$50 if you want one anytime soon. It's worth it on the weekends. Most PAX don't like the LED signs around here. They have already stopped giving them out. Sorry."
Seen tonight on my ride home,31,38.48580893849609,Lyft,Image,"I mean I get it, but if you're so tired stop driving. Jesus. That's as dangerous as driving high or drunk.

In GA driving while you’re tired can result in DUI. Take a fucking break then. Drivers who grind it out instead of taking breaks piss me off. Dirty cars, piss bottles, smells. Self care and cleanliness go a long way. A number of studies have found that driving tired is more unsafe than driving drunk or high, so I'd send this photo directly to Lyft just as I got the hell out of the car. I don't get why someone would even put a sign like this. Just for more tips since he underlined college student twice? 🤔 That’s just as dangerous. Being tired and driving is dangerous... I once saw a sign in my lyft that said “Help keep me off the pole. Tips appreciated!” 🤷🏽‍♂️fuck it gotta get that shmoney I might have empathy, but tired is as dangerous as stoned!

Best advice to get tips?,17,38.676966345914536,Lyft,"I am new to all of this, and am looking for good advice.

What is your absolute best advice on how to generate the best tips from passengers? I know I should have a clean vehicle and mirror if they are talkative or not, but I am looking for other advice. I know one driver I rode with had a free snack basket with chip bags in it for free, and another had bottled water for a nominal fee. 

What is your best advice on things I can do to generate more tips? I will appreciate any help, no matter how small or insignificant you might think it is.","Absolute best advice to get tips: become a waitress or bartender. I drive as smooth as I can and have chill music on. Also helps to keep my car extra clean. Just be normal and polite absolutely do not have food and drinks in your car that's a way to lose money and tips Forget about giving away free shit.  If your providing that stuff they figure your making good money and can afford it...  So no tip you don't need it.  Whenever I get into a conversation about what they pay and what I receive and how it's really not worth it to drive.  I get tips..  people have no idea what we get.  They assume we get most of the money.  Once I tell them, they say boy that does suck, and they tip. In my opinion if someone is going to tip, they are going to do so unless you do something to make them not want to. The basis for me is a clean vehicle, and a safe ride to their destination. I'll engage in conversation if they initiate it, otherwise I'm quiet. There isn't some formula for this. I just don’t force small talk and generally stay quiet and get tipped more often than not"
Does Lyft steals tips like Doordash?,6,38.746839031099725,Lyft,I don't mind carrying cash on me if I have to? Is it alright to tip drivers through the app?,"Cash is king whenever you can No you get your tip 100% with Lyft. I don’t believe Lyft has any guaranteed minimum wages do I don’t think so!  That said, cash is always nice. I've never noticed, sometimes I have people tip while I just dropped them off and they're still in the car Always cash is better.  We don't need Lyft or Uber knowing what we make in tips if we can avoid it.  They use that as reason to lower driver pay.  And judging by the laughter of hearing I'll tip you in the app, I wonder how many times people have tipped and we never see it.  Could be one of the reasons they don't match us with the same customer more than once"
Had my first day with Lyft yesterday and have some questions with weird issues,16,38.74999875332195,Lyft,"During a ride with one of my customers I started getting phone calls from another person asking where I was. The app automatically accepted someone else's ride WHILE i was already giving some else a ride... is this normal? 

When I dropped him off the map re routed me to that next person and this continued for 3 hours. I dont appreciate the app doing this. On top of that and I had someone else loose their wallet in my car and I ended up having to find my way back since the map doesnt save their locations and you can't zoom in on addresses.","Constantly having a passenger is a good thing.
Am I the only driver who wants to have a new rider lined up when I drop off the current passenger? Lyft will add rides to your queue so basically they auto accept requests while you are giving a ride, and once you complete that ride they direct you to pick up the next passenger. To stop this you have to go offline during a ride. I think the option is “set to last ride.” You get $15 for returning a item forgotten in your car.

I usually check each time i drop someone off look at backseat/floor if anyone left anything prevented alot of wallets/cellphones and headphones being left in my car.

Yes app will add random people like that to your route if the original person you picking up selected ""Share Ride""

I have this happen even if i pick up 1 person and put in that its my last ride of the night, i still get people added to the route ""That are on the way""

Test out couple different time periods/days/best times to drive around in your area.  Personally for me i only drive friday/saturday nights cause its only time it ends up being worth it.

&#x200B;

Also weird part.  Lyft doesnt allow you pick up same people \*some weird  safety thing\*.  >.> litterly havent had same person being picked up yet while driving for over 5 months.  Its really weird.  Also i seem to get less people now than when i first drove for 2 months. Any rides that are added to your queue while you're already doing a ride, you can cancel without penalty. My least favorite thing about them is you have no idea where they are headed until you arrive to pick them up. So if I'm in a busy area at a busy time, and I have to drive over 5 min for an auto-add I just cancel because I can usually get another ride within 1 minute and know where they are headed. If it's a slow time and I'm trying to stay busy I always do them. This is normal and one of the ""we're not independent contractors"" argument. We don't have a way to screen that rider before the app auto accepts the ride, and Lyft makes it difficult to cancel the ride: you have to cancel it before ending the first ride or else it counts against your cancellation percent."
"In my cuty they required a business license. If i get an LLC, will i need commercial insurance? Thoughts please::",6,38.81119088296261,Lyft,,"Excuse me? Cuty? If you drive for lyft and had to pay for commercial insurance, I think you're going to find that Lyft doesn't pay enough to cover the tab. IANAL. No. You'll need rideshare coverage through your personal policy but you won't need commercial coverage for yourself, that's covered under Lyft's insurance. Talk to a green light hub, they will have a better idea on how it has to be. 

In my state, local cities are banned from regulating TNCs. So I don’t know Uber plus companies work. 

But most secretaries of states run LLCs and articles of incorporation. You may also see if making a DBA might be cheaper/easier. 

There is no protection in a LLC when you are the one doing the work, so pushing for that when you own the car and do the driving is a waste of money. 

As for commercial insurance, most X and non black drivers don’t have to have commercial insurance, Uber provides that. However getting a rideshare endorsement on your insurance may be a good idea. 

There are four times in the eyes of rideshare insurance, Off is when the app is not logged in, you are on private insurance from there till you hit;

Online: period A
That’s when you have logged on and made yourself able to accept rides in the app. Most rideshare insurance works like your basic comp and collision insurance, if you run into someone they will pay the other party usually up to your state minimum. You usually have a $1,000 deductible if you have comprehensive coverage of your car. I think it’s 50k/100k/50k. If you have a rideshare endorsement you may not have to pay a deductible on your car. After that, once you accept a ride it swaps to;

In route: period B
Once you get a ride on the way to pick that person up you have another set of rules, Uber will tell you, probably just like period A, maybe different. Rideshare endorsement protects you here too.  Once you go to pick up a rider it becomes;

On trip: period C
After you pick up the rider usually you get $1,000,000 in insurance that matches your personal insurance, rideshare enforcements don’t work here except to maybe cut your deductible. 

Once you end the ride, you go back to period A. 

You may have a personal policy that doesn’t care, like I have it’s 30+ years old and says nothing about personal cars used for work or rideshare.

If you want to drive Uber black, you may need a CDL and commercial insurance."
How do you pick times for streak bonuses?,5,38.85584366074038,Lyft,Image,"They mean go online whenever you want. I've never gotten a streak ever,  no matter what time I drive. ""Pick any times that work for you..."""
Does anyone else get these?,19,38.904420049640315,Lyft,Image,"“It’s a trap!” Yeah it’s the new “surge price” I get them less frequently: once per two weeks or so?   I treat them like the Uber sticky surges: they’ve bought 5-10 minutes of exclusivity from me.  After that, I turn both apps back on and roll toward where I would be going (or not if I was going to hang there anyway).

They can be profitable.  But they can also be the same kind of trap as an airport queue. Super rare, I call them unicorn squares. Usually a few bucks That's the new personal power zone which replaced prime time. You’re guaranteed 1 per day. I usually get at least 2. It can be worth while. I made $17 off of a ride and it was only a minimum fare ride. I see youre in SLC! Same here. Downtown is the best place to keep them but I dont see then often. And I swear. When it tries to guide me to one, thats when im more likely to get a fare before i even reach the area. So frustrating! I got a few today in San Diego 👍 highest was $11.50 I get them most weekend nights, however I pretty much refuse to take them unless they are really large, like $10+. It's obvious they are trying to hype you up for a ride with the way the bonus ticks up every few seconds. No way does lyft intend on losing money on these rides, so they probably start the PPZ artificially low, that way after it has risen a few dollars you think you really scored big time by holding out. If it says $5.19 then the pax is probably paying at least $15+ over the normal rate. I've never seen one. 

Thanks Lyft.  


Sad face. Had my first PPZ in CLE last night. Made an extra $6 on an otherwise $3 ride!"
Pax left toenails all over floor... Lyft won't do anything,19,39.07469782741809,Lyft,Image,"Lyft won’t do anything if it takes 2 seconds to vacuum It’s gross true but wtf you want Lyft to do about it? Give you a dollar for vacuuming I can't believe you didn't see them doing it.  I would of been like excuse me are you cutting your toe nails?  Then pulled the car over and proceed to extricate them from the vehicle and cancel the ride.  If they don't have common respect and decency  I'll pay them back with the same.  I swear some areas of the country are cess pools,. I live in Cleveland and the people here would never do such a thing.  Never seen half the shit that some of you people accept as normal. The nail clippings aren't even the grossest part of the floormat. Wtf do you even expect Lyft to do about that? Dude... Vacuum that and give them one star and note it yeah that's gross but I feel like that's a little whiny I was thinking about keeping some of the toenails and framing her for murder (I think there is DNA in toenails, please don't roast if I'm wrong). I bet that would make sure she never does it again haha.

BTW if anyone was wondering, Lyft said it was OK to pick your toenails and leave them all over the floor. I wonder if you can also take a shit on the backseat as well?

I'll say it one more time so everyone can shut up. I don't t want money. It's very easy to clean. I want the rider suspended or disciplined. It's very disrespectful and rude to do this in someone's else's car. And lyft is saying it's OK to do, by them not doing anything about it You should bill them $15 for lost property, did you bag them up lol I said I don't care about the mess. I know it's easy to clean. It's the fact lyft won't do anything. I dont want money, I want the rider to be suspended or disciplined. By lyft not doing anything, they are saying that it's OK for riders to pick their dirty toe nails in your car. It's fucking disgusting I had a pax yesterday who decided that it would be OK to pick their toenails and leave them all over my floor. It's absolutely disgusting. All those white pieces are toenails. I can't believe someone would do this. Some of these riders are so rude, it pisses me off. To make it even better lyft decided they won't do a thing. I took pics and sent it but they said sorry we aren't gonna do a thing. I understand it's pretty easy to clean. I had to hand pick all the little pieces of toenails to get it out. It's the fact that someone could be so disrespectful and rude that really pisses me off. It looks like it’s on a floor mat. Stop being a pansy and shake it out."
Most cogent overview of where things stand yet...,3,39.20222097558004,Lyft,Image,"I like all the people complaining that it's the drivers' fault for abusing a system that was meant as just some extra cash, not a full time job. It takes some real mental gymnastics to blame people trying to make money and not the company screwing them over. 

Also I must have dreamed up all those bonuses offered to keep people on the road as long as possible, since clearly Uber and Lyft only want us to drive part time not all the time. Yep, that writer actually did research, amazing.  

The lesson Lyft and Uber should come away with is ""You're not actually competing with each other.  If you hadn't cut rates, drivers wouldn't have complained as much and nobody would have cared, but did you want to share? Nooooo.  Greed is your downfall.  Learn from your mistakes, stop cutting rates or reinventing new ways to cut rates and passing them off as 'improvements'"".

Literally if Lyft and Uber  raised existing california rates by 25% and said it was guaranteed for 2 years if the vote were killed, I'd totally get every passenger to kill that vote. Buy us off morons."
It’s fucking bullshit,53,39.3889802348393,Lyft,Image,"If you are only running Lyft and not doing Uber too, you are fucking yourself. Morning and evening rush on Lyft is not worth it bc the 13¢ per minute fucks you when your stuck in traffic and if you aren’t in a decent area, you won’t get the personal bonus. Always do uber during rush hour and learn where the surges sprout at what time. Then do Lyft during the slower hours (as well as Uber, but take Lyft rides over Uber rides bc the minimum is slightly more and the mileage rate on Lyft is better). Run both during last call but only take Lyft rides that have a decent personal bonus unless you hit the 2x+ surge on Uber. Don’t take a Lyft with a personal bonus for a 45+ minute ride. You will still get fucked at the end of the day but not quite as bad as you have been.

I can’t respond with a screenshot but I just looked at my fares and I have $846 for 39 hours in 53 rides and that’s only on Lyft. I have about another $450 on uber. Wow.  So much here.  Keep your chin up bro.  Some markets can't even top 200 in that time This is a good week for me.

In Ohio.

In a place like LA, I could easily see how this would be devastating. Y’all’s gas and insurance costs are easily much higher than mine, before you get into shit like rent. The rides are bullshit. I just went out during morning coffee time because it was busy. Got one ride and noped the fuck out of driving for the day after.

Pax paid 14 dollars for a 7 min 26 second ride. You'd think a driver would get 6 or 7 dollars from that. 

NOPE!

Lyft got $10.15 while i got $3.85. Such bullshit. 

I feel bad for the scabs that don't know any better and just continue to drive for some sort of money. You made more than $10/ride, thats actually good. Forgive me, I’m trying to genuinely understand what you’re zeroing in on. If you have around 70 rides for the week and earned about $700, that’s about $10 per ride. It amounts to about $17 per hour. Unless my math is wrong. Could you help elaborate on what’s the issue you want to highlight? That you think the pay is not cutting it for the effort expended? Yes,but some of that shit you have to do a full 40 hours even!! FYI-- this is not written specifically to the OP (other than paragraph about actual numbers) since I do not know how experienced you are at this job. The rest is mostly me just throwing out my approach for general consumption. 


I agree -- it is bullshit. I no longer accept any rides other than Lux/Black Lux for that exact reason. I don't know how anyone driving regular Lyft can make decent money with the new rate cards. It is important to get your true hourly pay in perspective-- so the only meaningful number on that screen is the total income. 


What were your actual working hours, mileage, and the average gas price? I imagine the real per hour rate is probably more like $14 or lower once you adjust for expenses and consider time spent out working. I have a nice spreadsheet I set up for this and even include a weekly cost for my insurance. All your costs need to be accounted for-- this job devours vehicles and maintenance. 


These are important numbers to me-- I keep track of this stuff to know when the best times to drive are that I want to drive. Typically-- anything between 10 am to 2 pm is dead for instance (Phoenix -- not dead so much as just too slow). I do NOT want to drive at night. So I just drive days anywhere between 6 am and noon at the latest. It is a lot less hours but most of those rides these days are with Uber (since the recent rate card fiasco) but on average, my 20 hours nets me about $400. I could make more and put more miles on the car I suppose but the other hours either are less lucrative or at times I just prefer to stay off the road or with passengers (drunks) who I have zero patience for typically. So...get a better fucking job.

Nobody is FORCING you to do this. I'm at about 24 hrs and 490. Made 200 in 10 hrs today bc Saturdays are the only decent days now. I'm 4 rides from a bonus and 14 from the full bonus.


Edit: 29 hours. Not 24. May tomorrow help me reach my goal 17 bucks an hour? It's actually really good! I end up averaging 10$’a hour here. Lol Dude... I don't know why you're complaining. Most people would love to make nearly 700$ in only 39 hours. It's because of people like you that are ruining it for the rest of us. My ""day job"". I work 52 hours a week, making 700 weekly. Honestly I thought this was good, and was living fine until I got divorced and need to save up for a new place. If it weren't for that I wouldn't need to drive. Damn entitled kids think they should just be handed money. Try actually working for what you have. 39 hours straight???? Wow that's a lot of driving and also this equals out to being $10 a ride. You didn't even. Break $700. This amount should be at least $1000. Too much wear and tear on your car. This is why I never drove with Lyft. Besides the fear of being harmed as a female driver We need to strike! I'm lucky to hit 500 in 45hrs. Man Lyft is Bull shit. Uber pays you double this amount. Just an advise, stop driving for Lyft. ."

Lyft No Longer Showing Time/Direction Of New Ride,8,39.62657282744293,Lyft,Anyone notice they no longer let you know how long the ride will be or in what direction?,"Not sure about your market but in our area (LA) you have to keep a 90% acceptance rate or better but I noticed it doesn’t display till you get to 91. 

So if you decline or miss a few ride requests it goes away.

It’s also at times very inaccurate with both direction and time. 

Although I like having it I wont hesitate to decline requests if they are not worth it.

Just another BS way lyft tries to control their “independent contractor” workforce of drivers. Go to your Dashboard and check your stats. Must be 91% +. fuck lyft, trailer trash clients Try Uninstall/reinstall app. Worked for me I’m at 97% acceptance rate for the week lol fuck lyft Just Uber?"
Charged twice?,3,39.84874875336885,Lyft,"I had taken a Lyft a few days ago and my payment went through and it’s already out of my bank and stuff.

I also see another charge on there though, for the exact same payment as my last lyft. 

It’s currently a pending transaction and the name is “Lyft Riders”.

It’s not the authorization one since it doesn’t have authorizing anywhere in the name.

I don’t know where this charge came from. I do believe that money has been taking out of my account though, which puts me in a rough spot.

Anyone know what this charge is? I can’t find anything online about it.","Typically similar to paying for fuel at the pumps, they put a temporary charge on your account when the ride begins to make sure your account is open and active. Then after the ride they complete the payment. The pending transaction should come off in 3-5 days. They hold it there in case you decide to add a stop or change the trip destination to something longer."
Without passenger/drive-to fee?,6,40.024153845972485,Lyft,"I heard recently that Lyft will start paying you as soon as you accept a ride.

Only in certain areas. Don’t worry, you’ll experience it soon enough. When they roll out a new “feature”, they stagger it. A few markets get it first, then more, and more, and more, until it’s everywhere. It’s like a plague. Here’s how Lyft announces it will screw you. 

# **Big news: we will now pay you an extra $1!!!**

(*) *this new dollar feature will now cost you $2*

They pay you to pick up pax at about half the total rate they used to pay you. 

Don’t look forward to this new rate. [removed] This is how Uber and Lyft get away with so much abuse. OP is actually looking forward to a massive pay cut."
Scary Ride - predator driver?,14,40.26291542004656,Lyft,"My girlfriend just cal me in tears about a scary Lyft ride. She uses Lyft on a regular basis in the early hours of the morning to get to work. No real issues and no safety concerns until this morning 

She just called me in tears and had a huge scare.

Her driver took the wrong route, was going down side streets and not responding when asked where he was going. When she told him to stop as she wanted out, he took a while to do so and stopped on a side street. 

She ran to the corner and went into a McDonalds and the driver turned around and parked across the street and watched her. 

Here’s the thing, there no record of the ride on her app, no feedback can be given, no record of the drivers name or license plate. How can this happen?

And yes, she has a notification that she called a Lyft and she checked the license plate matched when he pulled up.

Now she’s trying to call Lyft and we all know how long that can take to speak to a person.

Thoughts?","Update : when the driver cancels a ride, it disappears from your phone app Nevertheless file a police report. They would be be very interested in this character AAAAaaaaannnndddd... that's one of the reasons why I tell my wife, family, friends, and riders to use Uber... Uber has that nice little blue shield at the bottom left that will send a call to 911 with your ping location...  Lyft offers NO security! > no record of the drivers name or license plate 
> she has a notification that she called a Lyft and she checked the license plate matched

Does anyone have experience getting injured by their Lyft driver?,31,40.69183903117147,Lyft,"Last year my driver hit me after I got out of her car. Lyft support was no help at all. The last time I talked to them they referred me to an insurance company that claimed not to represent them. Once they found out I had proof the driver was at fault they basically ghosted me. Is this like, just how they do business or what?","Talk to a personal injury lawyer about going after the driver. You sound like a scammer... You want advice how to do it better this time?  Happened last year and your posing questions?  How does a driver hit you after you get out of the car?  I didn't hear about that, or what damages it caused.  Anyone who helps this pathetic fool deserves the karma. Looked like he barely hit you. If you think your gonna get money for that you must be joking.  Hospital bills?  What did you get your head checked and they told you were crazy and admitted you?   If life is that difficult for you, just throw in the towel already.  Nobody is gonna feel sorry for you especially a jury. Do you have a video? You were already out of the car. So forget about Lyft. Forget about Lyft. Forget about Lyft. If you are lucky they may have given you the driver's Insurance company. But I doubt it very much. So if you still have the drivers license plate, you can find him and his insurance policy will pay. That is a good chance that he's not properly insured though. And you probably have to sue to get the driver's ID from Lyft."
Thoughts on Express Drive Program?,9,40.773031160809374,Lyft,"I’m new to LA and am looking for a job. I also don’t have a car. Would this be a decent way to get started with some money and also have some wheels? 

Thoughts? People who have done the program? 

Thanks!","As previously mentioned, it’s a bandaid fix if you don’t have a car, but starting $200-250 in the red every week and having to crawl your way out with an even lower rate card than lyft economy in your service region is not worth it in the long run. I’m working on leaving the express drive program due to lyft pocketing 60-70% of rider payment on every trip I take. It's a complete scam.  They figure you don't have a car so your really hard up and will take advantage of you more.  Will make them rent the car and then take more of their money while they drive.  How anyone doesn't see how this is a conflict of interest, just tells you how dumb people are to go ahead and do it.  One doesn't have anything to do with the other unless they were actually providing the car themselves.  You should be able to rent from any car place and then get paid normal rate.  That's how the real business world would work, but these people are independent contractors,. Real business tycoon types.  They are just so smart to be stupid enough to fall for this bamboozle. Idk how it is in LA but in Vegas it’s pretty garbage. In L.A. it's a good TEMPORARY solution if you're looking for a job and plan to eventually get your own car.

It's a $250 deposit and about $248 weekly, which Lyft starts withholding from your driver account on Mondays.

So you can plan on driving Monday and Tuesday just to make the weekly payment, and the rest of the week is pure profit (minus gas).

One thing to consider is Lyft pays Express Drivers about .10 cents less per mile.

Another solid option in L.A. is Maven. Even though they recently raised their prices, they have the Electric Chevy Bolt, which will cost you about $360 a week, but you'll have no gas expenses, and besides Lyft, you can also Uber and deliver food with it. Fun little car.

Welcome to L.A. You'll hate it here, but you'll never leave. If you don't mind a lot of driving it's fine. If you can afford the deposit give it a shot. As a single person, with no wife or children, and basically not much social life, and who lives in the Sacramento area it's been alright. Been doing it for a while. 

You're in it for the full time, long haul with it though, as that's the only way to pay off the car and still make some kind of decent money. (Well, decent depending on your situation. What I make per week actually works fine for ME, but for you LA/Bay area people you'd just laugh and call me a stupid fool.)

You live in LA, so I would not suggest it. You can find better work."
Uber pays drivers more?,17,40.815426994142705,Lyft,"I have no idea what percentage either company purports to leave for their drivers, but I just had 2 nearly identical trips (+/- 3 blocks), one through Lyft, the other through Uber, and Uber paid more by a lot - $16 to Lyft's $11. I've been getting the feeling lately that Lyft wasn't paying as much on longer trips (harder to tell on shorter), but could never be sure until this weird stroke of coincidence. Frankly, I'm shocked a) because I always thought of Uber as the asshole of the industry, and b) by the size of the discrepancy. Are other drivers seeing this difference too? Are there maybe mitigating factors I'm not seeing?","Im in Austin and they just changed the rates and started paying you for the drive to pick up...i routinely make less than uber now. It’s ridiculous..not going back till they fix it. It really changes on a month-by-month basis. Woah, it's like I'm at the airport queue and nobody knows how they get paid If you were an ordinary cab driver it might be a lot more transparent.

Where I worked at least (30 years ago), the fare paid by the passenger is a combination of 'flag' (when passenger gets in the car), distance and time - time is charged when the vehicle is stopped as in traffic or waiting for a passenger to do their errand.

The night's take was shared 50/50 with the owner, owner is responsible for fuel, vehicle maintenance and dispatch fees.  Driver kept all tips. In Portland Oregon the drivers seem to be of a consensus that Lyft pays worse then Uber due to several factors:

1) Clearer use of surge bonuses, versus PPZs. 

2)  Some pay for long drives to pickups. 

3). Better at paying for cancellations. Lyft has been taking more recently because they're too stupid to figure out how to become profitable, so they're exploiting the fact that people perceive them to be a better company in order to try to gain ground against Uber. A very dumb strategy that is backfiring fast. Both companies show you how much you are paid on every trip. The most important is the $/mile rate. Say in LA, both start at about $0.80 at the beginning of the year. Uber raced down to $0.60 but Lyft stayed put. Even with the new Lyft scheme where you are paid as soon as you accepted the ping, no way that can be dcompensate by a $0.30 / mile rate."

One time I actually laughed because I knew this diamond covered, middle aged woman was definitely not going to tip me. I always tip in the app but never mention it to the driver. I thought that was just how it was supposed to work. I always say that and I always do it. Usually immediately on exiting the car. 

Based on how common this this post is, I bet you anything lyft is skimming tips. Fuck lyft and fuck Uber. Lately most of them have been tipping for me after they say that. one time i had a driver that was super nice but i had no cash and my phone was dying, i said i would tip him, but after i got out the car my phone died as i sat to send the tip. It didnt let me tip him, so i had to email lyft to get the driver his tip and i felt so bad. 

tldr: i had to email lyft to get the driver their tip after missing the time slot Shoot. I *always* tip but never verbally mention anything, I just enter the tip shortly after I get out of the car. Should I say something at the end of rides? I should print this and hang it on the back of my head rests. Honestly, while I’m sure some/a decent chunk even don’t actually tip when they say that, I have a couple friends who take lyft all the time say that they have to carry cash because it just won’t even show up

Tbh I think part of it’s actually Lyft’s fault I tend to find that African Americans never tip, just a thought. Not meant  to be racist. Wait so people tip with cash? I always tip through the app. I thought we were specifically not supposed to tip with cash? FYP - [Imgur](https://imgur.com/ETXjr9h) All non-tippers automatically get a 1 star deduction.

It’s an overblown and hysterical reaction. It is 6.6 miles or about 12-15 mins from the last stop at Southwest Transit to Paisley Park.  I current don't see any information about the line being extend further once it is done.  The current line from Eden Prairie to Minneapolis does a great job of bypassing the busy areas, such as uptown. I don't think it is actually going to hurt the ride share market.

>Hi Sexy\_Anxiety,Thank you for contacting us about your experience. We appreciate you taking the time to let Lyft know.I want to reassure you that I have passed these concerns along to the team that can assist you further regarding your specific feedback. A member of this team will be reaching out to you shortly.If there's anything else you’d like to inform us of, respond directly to this message.

I understand it needs to be investigated, but I once gave a driver 4 stars and left a comment saying he complains about his job too much. Lyft sent me a message within the hour apologizing for my bad experience and said it was being handled. I wanted to know if this is normal procedure for them, and if he is at least not allowed to use the app during this time? I live in Vegas, it's over 30% Hispanic with tons of tourists, God knows how he has been/is treating them.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who answered my question, because of this I contacted Lyft through Twitter and got a call the same night, said they put a hold on his account. It really turns my stomach to see how many people attacked me over this and took his side. This was not a guy I disagreed politically, he was not a casual racist, nor did he just have ""different opinions"" or ""free speech"". This man agreed with a terrorist who slaughtered people in mass and talked in length about pure white people. Not only is this not protected free speech, he was working for a company and it is against their policies as well (in fact it's against this subreddits policies). Not to mention things like this are taken very seriously in Vegas after we had one of the largest mass shootings and a woman who drove her car through the strip sidewalk.","Is Sexy Anxiety your given name or the one you use for the app? 

I would decline/cancel that ride everytime just for you not using your real name. [removed] Although it's concerning, Lyft won't deactivate every driver who's passenger accuses them of complaining too much or being racist. They usually send a message telling the driver that there was a report about inappropriate comments, which is against Lyft's TOS. Lyft keeps track of complaints and if the same driver shows a pattern of getting reports and bad ratings he will naturally be deactivated. I feel your pain. I drove an old man today complaining about how much he hates it when he gets Mexican drivers. He said none of them ""speak English"", and they all ""drive like they're in Mexico"". That is obviously not true.  


It was a 20 minute ride and he complained about Mexicans for the first half of the trip. When he realized I was completely ignoring him, he shut up.  


I reported him to Lyft, but I doubt anything will happen. Just take the damned ride. getting all pissed off serves no useful purpose. ""Sexy\_Anxiety"" LOL.   


Report seems legit. They're worried about 15 different things concerning the driver. These are not violations for immediate suspension. He will be in bigger trouble if he gets more report. And it depends on how you report him. Hate speech, racist speech, sympathize with a mass shooter are more powerful than politically incorrect. [removed]"
Lyft proposes $21 an hour to fight legislation,61,42.069674679374806,Lyft,Image,"I still think it is a shitty way for them to avoid classifying us a employees and avoid providing benefits, but as someone with a full time job and benefits already this kicks ass for part time drivers. Looks like the protests actually paid off! $21 an hour is peanut 🥜 compared to what drivers are worth. 
The only reason they are offering that is because the alternative would net drivers sooooooo much more The person in the article says 21 dollars an hour is an insult to drivers. What are they smoking out there in California? I’m here in Las Vegas making less than 10 dollars an hour on a bad day. Yeah meanwhile today I worked 10 hours and made $72 minus $15 for gas.  Then on top of that they are routinely taking 50% or more of the fare. still won’t be enough to shut these people up As a part timer $21 an hour would be great They would just cut it a week after the vote anyway. Well that's just an ssumption you've made, not much I can say about that but that I'm a great driver as well, but that job can be done by standard drivers. 

In fact most are, if not less than standard. 

You're just salty that's a fact. Why do people think that Lyft would ever give employee drivers enough hours to get benefits?

If we in california become lyft employees, here is what will happen:

Lyft will immediately fire a bunch of drivers they don't need, probably anybody under a 4.9 rating.

Lyft will introduce scheduling blocks that take away your freedom of scheduling and limit you to 30 hours max, which isn't full time in California, so they can avoid overtime pay and paying benefits

Part time drivers  will basically quit, since they can't afford to be on an actual schedule since they have other jobs

The idea that drivers will make 30 an hour is fucking ridiculous. I mean, I'd love it if possible, but its NOT possible. This job has two requirements: have a license, and be over 21. They will pay nothing over the minimum wage, guaranteed.

This idea that ""Oh, we'll be employees and then everything will be the best ever!"" is flawed. If they offered to pay for my gas as well as maintenance for my car I would take that They'd raise the per minute rate to 35 cents. Big fucking deal. Drivers would be smarter to just demand 70-75% of the fare. That’d be a 33% pay cut for me. Fuck the people trying to ruin this. I feel like I'm missing something. Why don't these people get real jobs? They're healthy enough to be protesting..

The purpose of doing ride share was to have extra cash.. Not so you can be lazy and sit on your ass all day to complain about not being able to afford health insurance.

Just fyi if these guys are forced to pay out, they'll take it out of riders 😂"
Lyft Express Drive car brakes squeaking (or squealing),9,42.45713995716362,Lyft,"  
I'm a girl who knows nothing about cars, so pardon my ignorance. After 3 months in a beater which I hated, I finally got a nicer, newer Kia Optima from Hertz on Monday, but the brakes are making that annoying high-pitch sound as I come to a stop.   


Someone told me that Hertz only authorizes the cheapest brake pads available and this is a common issue, but not a dangerous one. Is this true? Should I take the car back to Hertz, or drive it like that?    


I'm afraid if I take it back they're just going to swap me into another beat up car and I will lose this nice Optima. But of course, I don't want to drive it if it's dangerous, especially with passengers. TIA","You should probably take it back before a passenger hears it and reports you as driving an unsafe vehicle.  People don’t like hearing squealing brakes. Is it breaking okay though? Sometimes when new breaks are put on they make those noises for a couple days. I just put new breaks on my car and they squeaked for about 2 days. Gave me anxiety! You could wait it out a day, but I’d definitely take it in if it continues. Goodluck OP! [deleted] Bring the vehicle to an authorized service location and tell them. You'll hopefully get new brakes. there not going to do anything about it unless threy swap you , sadly"
New driver for express. Advice or truth?,14,42.488505697904365,Lyft,"I’ve just started the express program after the countless lyfters I used exclaimed the joys of working ‘independently’ and the great cash they were receiving.  They explained between 5-6 days a week were on the road; various hours.  While a few said they averaged between 60-70 hrs, most were selling me on the 40-50 hr range.  But after driving for the last three days I ask myself how anyone could do this without some form of schedule or further how could you schedule this to have freedom in your life?  It would appear you have to get up during the ass crack of dawn, take a break in the day, then be right back on the road no later than 4.  Even after perhaps coming up with some kind of plan to earn, the rides you grab locally only pay out between 3.60-10 (and $10 is really pushing it) with the average of zero tips.  They expect you to pay over $1000 dollars a month to rent the vehicle, not including the gas, or reach the tier program where they ‘deduct’ amounts off the rental costs.  Prime example - 70 rides gets you $70 off the $260 base price.  That’s not a lot of money off considering the gas factor from the daily drives.  You can’t tap into any money you make until the rental costs are covered for the week.. which I can assume means that you’d have to hustle the first two-three days (9-10 hrs of waiting around for pings that pay you decently..) and what, use the other 4-5 days to cover the gas you’ve used up, food, and cleaning supplies for the car to keep it nice.  

I had issues when I would read lyfters on here getting upset, but the truth is for lyft express I can understand the frustration.  They’re taking 60% of your rides - especially on the longer runs, which if they don’t tip, leaves you in the wake of tears. Having your own car and doing this would make a lot more sense and be extremely practical to earn extra money for the household.  Lyft express however appears to be some sort of financial tactic to lure in people who don’t have vehicles at the moment and tell them it’s incredibly easy to fund renting the car all the while making tons of money which is a blatant white lie.  You can earn money, you’re just going to give up your life in the process.

If lyft had any practical sense of keeping lyft express alive they’d need to change this rate situation.  The base rate for the month should be $300-400 vs the $1000 they ask.  Most of us have our own insurance.. and Jesus Christ don’t get me started on the thousand dollar out of pocket deductible if forbid you’ve gotten into any kind of accident (whether at fault or not).  Legitimately seems very scheme oriented and not user friendly. 

Anyway love to hear some personal opinions if anyone else just started express!","Yep the fair or express thing is a scam aimed at the poor to make them indebted Renting a car for any reason for $1000 a month is obviously absurd. It's a horrible, horrible deal.     

I bought my car with $4k cash. That's 4 months of rental and I've been driving it for Lyft and Uber for more than 4 years now.      

Don't rent a car for Lyft or Uber. Honestly it's only worth it until you get a personal car.  I use the car to go back and forth to work and personal freedom.  Work enough to pay for car and gas for the week.  

I have the choice to play Lyft/Uber/Metro and waste hours a week on commute or drive 15 hours a week for a personal car.  So save 5 hours a week spend money or lose 5 hours and gain a personal car.  I do plan on getting my own car when I am ready. Stop asking your drivers stupid questions. Very few will tell you the truth for fear of you (as the passenger) giving them a bad rating for complaining.   


Do you go around asking everyone how much money they make and how much they pay for their work tools? It's rude and ignorant, to say the least."
Why is this message popping up? All my documents are up to date. There’s no reason why it says this all of a sudden,4,42.52381819791815,Lyft,Image,"Seems like your might have gotten deactivated Deactivated.

They will contact you via email first I think? Did you get a new phone?  If so, you have to log out of your old one and log in to your new phone. Looks like you are not approved to drive"
Does Lyft have a localized Lost and Found anymore?,6,42.64189690162186,Lyft,"I left something on a lyft, but not sure which one, was over the course of a week. They used to have centralized offices in a city that things were turned in. Does this still exist?","Some cities have hubs that lost items can be returned too, but it's hard to say for sure if your driver might have actually found the item and actually brought it in to the office.

[You can find local hubs here](https://thehub.lyft.com/hours)"
What do you wish you knew before becoming a driver,3,42.691341346077344,Lyft,"I'm thinking about becoming a driver. I live in a military town of about 105,000. I have a full time job (40-46 hrs a week) and I go to school part time. I understand that everywhere is different, but would it be worth it to work only 3 hours a day for 3 or 4 days? I guess what I'm asking is: is 3 rides an hour good or bad, and how much can I expect to make in an hour given that I avg 3 rides an hour? 

Another question is: is there any kind of binding contract if I decide that it's not for me after only a couple of days? 

Is there a minimum amount of rides that I have to give to cover the cost of insurance? I have heard something about this.

Thank you for taking the time to read and comment. I'm sorry if my questions are dumb, but I really don't know anything about Lyft outside of just being a passenger about 3 times.","You are 1099  Independent contractor. You are free to do what you want. Drive a little or a lot. Sign in and out as much as you want.  Insurance you need to a add a rideshare to your personal policy. You stop driving whenever you want. Nothing, I’m glad I knew nothing. Cause I probably wouldn’t of done it. Plus the money does help. Even though it’s painfully slow and a saturated market. Be smart about when and where you go online to stay busy as much as possible. Drive safely with with passengers and make them feel comfortable to increase the chance of a tip. A lot of drivers have the mentality of, my car my rules. At the end of the day, if you provide a good and professional service, you will get higher tips. If you drive like you are doing everyone a favor, it will show and you will get less tips."
Temporary deactivation,6,42.734512642373645,Lyft,"
Yesterday got an email from Lyft that my account was put on temporary deactivation. Called the support, all they told me that they can’t share any info just because they don’t want to give any false information, which is weird, but also told me that I’ll get a call from person who’s in charge of investigation. Later same day I got a call from them. So basically, some of the passengers accusing me in “driving under influence” and “use of profanity that makes him/her uncomfortable”. Lyft person asked if I remember anything like that happening. 


Yes!! I do it all the fucking time! (NO)

Getting close to 3000 rides and constantly 5.00 (unless some special one giving me 1 star and fucking everything up)

So I explained to Lyft that nothing like that ever happening and I take it seriously. Then they immediately reactivated my account.

People are shit! Be careful.","Fucking bitch-ass trunk passengers stink up your car and the next sober passenger gets in and accuse your of being drunk. Every time I drive a drunk passenger, I have the windows open and open all windows after dropping them off to make sure the smell does not stay. Just tell them np such thing happened and your account will be on soon (12 hours or something). They deactivated me twice before. One for this stupid reason and the other was when the passenger freaked out when I started.moving when she had not finished buckling... I mean WTF, BITCH! I just picked you up in a 1st lane at evening rush hour with 2 buses behind me! People think we can just fucking hang in the 1st lane during rush hour and flip off the buses n shit, Fuck that! People are the worst, mate. Dash cam dude it stops bs like that all the time. It doesn’t even have to actually record it just makes them think twice about being fucking cunts. I vent and spray my car down with every weekend ride. The alcohol smell seems to stick around a bit longer then most. Maybe it's all the ass sweat on my leather seats. Dunno. That is a blessing to get deactivated.  Why are you dealing with this crap and dangers of rideshare for low pay? It isn't worth it.  Some of you guys never cease to surprise me.  You should've quit long ago.  You're being a slave for cheap money and getting lies put against you to cause your deactivation."

[deleted] I definitely prefer driving for Uber than Lyft. Lyft is run by a bunch of money hungry con artists. Jesus H. Christ, how many times is this going to be posted? It’s *FAKE NEWS*. Their study was flawed when they allowed drivers to cherry pick the fares. They even acknowledge this at the end of the article.

Protect your right to drive
 
In a few days, California lawmakers will vote on AB 5. 

As it's currently written, AB 5 may require Lyft to offboard hundreds of thousands of drivers, and remove the flexibility to choose how and when you drive. As a result, passengers could take fewer rides, wait longer for rides, and risk losing reliable access to Lyft altogether. 

After talking with thousands of California drivers, we're proposing a revision that protects your earnings and your flexibility. Our proposal includes additional workplace protections for drivers and a minimum earnings floor. 

The Los Angeles Times Editorial Board says our proposal, ""would offer more help to part-time workers than reclassifying them as employees and robbing them of the flexibility and opportunities that attracted them to the work in the first place.1"" 

Our ask? Help us make sure AB 5 truly represents drivers' best interests. Make your voice heard with a quick call urging Governor Gavin Newsom and lawmakers to take a leadership position in fixing AB 5. We'll connect you with your representative and provide information on how best to #FixAB5.

I’m dying 😂😂😂😂 “help us keep paying you like slaves and disrespecting labor laws”

What a joke of a company.","Next you'll be getting:  
""We've heard you when you told us you'd rather be paid half price than be subjected to restrictive government regulations.  That's why we're excited to announce we're paying you even less than that, so you can make more!"" That's Lyft in panic mode 😂😂😂 If you think Lyft has your back on this then I’ve also got a bridge to sell you straight to $$$ paradise! Yes. The minimum earnings floor sounds potentially good to me, but you know for sure they'll find a way to fuck u somewhere different Help us keep giving it to you raw! I’m actually not fine with waking up without the job as I’m still reliant on this income as well. 
But let’s also be aware that of course U/L are going to use the threat of removing everyone from the platform as their #1 weapon to get us on board with whatever it is they propose, which of course, will not be fair to drivers, but we’ll all be so scared of waking up without the job anymore that we even jump on social media to encourage other drivers to accept the new terms. 

Reality is, we all managed to scrape by before Lyft & Uber came along, which was fairly recent in grand scheme of things. And well simply have to return to whatever it is we were all doing before. Only now there are even more options than there were before this service came to be! Don’t forget that. 

Also, nobody is going to be okay without the service as we are all reliant on it if not for driving, people are accustomed to using it for work & living, shopping etc...
A new company will be guaranteed be born overnight from the ashes that will simply do things in a way that is closer to everyone winning, minus the bad investments that have left Uber “broke” supposedly, which will allow the new company to thrive especially in an economy that is suddenly void of Uber and Lyft. 

Point is, it doesn’t all just suddenly come to a halt for everyone the way Uber and lyft wants us all to believe that it will. I am against AB5 and want to better understand comments here that seem very much for it. Admittedly I may not understand all of the details here since I’m a rider and not a driver. A lot of the comments seem to be from drivers and I am open to being informed in my response to try to state my current view on this. 

As soon as I heard about AB5 my first thought was that this is ridiculous.. this is an industry that didn’t exist 10 years ago and now regulation comes along that may strangle it from operating? 

As a frequent rider on Lyft I have to say the experience 
of using the app to complete a ride is like none other especially when I flash back to 10 years ago when I was banging my head on a wall waiting for a taxi..  I am against anything that would be disruptive to the massive improvement. 

No one is forcing anyone to be a gig economy worker. Of course when using Lyft I’ve met a few who do it full time. In my overall experience using Lyft as a rider I have *mostly* heard from many “alternative” driver stories. For instance, they do this on the side, or are between jobs or figuring it out. Or are taking a big trip this year and want to make extra money. Some in “retirement” looking to be social and get out of the house. The list of these “alternatives” goes on and on..

If the full-timers hated the gig economy so much why not look for other work or employers that can meet the benefits they want? The last few years have led up to the current lowest unemployment rate in decades.. and it seems many independent contractors have had opportunity to fill full-time jobs that offer benefits. 

So why put such a glorious business model at risk? Continue with legislation like AB5 and other similar or tighter regulation in the future and Lyft et al will be the new taxi of the “future” You know I keep saying it and saying it but you guys really should sign it. You guys keep saying you want more wages and while I agree with that what you're about really about get is no job."
"My 1k lyft jacket came in today. Lyft is love, Lyft is life!",7,42.77994088312542,Lyft,Image,"hahahahahahahahaha.... A driver not bitching about money?

Now you I like. U so funny... So I get a jacket at 1000? What do I get from Uber for a 1000? Wear it with pride! This jacket paid for by the cut rates of less than .40 cents per mile in Vegas, Phoenix and other cities, enjoy. Yeah. Lyft still hates you."
Lyft is trying to trick us users,88,42.8080890312846,Lyft,Image,"Common you guys.  If a whore can jack off 2 dicks while sucking the 3rd, the guys all pay slightly less since she’s already on the job.

That is basically Uber pool/shared. From what I see on this sub you guys would probably benefit from becoming employees. “Help us keep paying you like slaves” not a driver but a frequent Lyft user — just got this email and came to reddit to see what y'all actually think of this? would this actually negatively impact most drivers?? You replaced the word warn with tricked it appears.

Let’s revisit this when the law goes into effect and all those drivers get laid off while prices go up. Yeah, I don't want to be an employee, I'd rather work on my own time ""...the majority of drivers have said...""  ""...talking with thousands of California drivers...""

Yeah. Bullshit. It's a double edged sword. Drivers could be given schedules, forced dispatch, mandatory breaks, limited hours, etc. They are not trying to trick us they are telling us the reality. The reality is that the Drivers who want this bill passed are being short sighted. It won't matter how high the wages are because you won't have a job...  Lyft and uber will not and cannot pay money that they don't have. These protesters are being greedy and stupid to think otherwise. I'm a driver, and while I don't like that there are no contract protections, I don't want Lyft telling me who I HAVE to pick up, or WHEN I HAVE to work. So in general, I'm a lot happier as a contractor. If you aren’t a driver, you really shouldn’t vote. Free county and all. But if you want to do what’s right, let the drivers decide for themselves what they actually want. You saving, or not saving, a buck doesn’t matter. How about Lyft just stop employing new people to new ""fun"" initiatives & giving away free shit for tax breaks & just pay drivers the majority of the fare because they are doing the actual work & just STFU & collect their commission for literally just being a fucking app..."
"‘Not worth the money’, some Twin Cities drivers say after Lyft changes pay",5,42.930137642395714,Lyft,Image,"My first and only Lyft ride today was a no show. The other 3 yesterday were $2.62 a piece. Shit like that it’s just depressing. I’ll rather just wait all day for one good Uber ride than torment my soul.  Lyfts business strategy seems to be about scraping the bottom of the pot. That shit don’t pay bills, man. > drivers told the company they wanted to be paid for their effort to pick up a passenger

Assuming this is true and just not bluster to justify the cut, I can imagine the only idiots whining about this were the 95% AR monkeys who take damn near every ping and go pikachuface.jpg after driving 22 minutes to take someone round trip to the corner store. 

The solution to unpaid pickup's is to just stop doing them. If you *are* going to negotiate for more money then it cant come with any concessions. The day I found out you could email lyft for a long pickup fee my AR went from the *teens* to 100% overnight. Well maybe if they were like 25 minutes away I wouldnt get them. Guess what happened when lyft stopped paying out, boom right back down to 19%. And it would have stayed like that if lyft made a switcheroo and offered me the $5 again but with strings attached. 

Whats crazy is I remember doing all these asinine pickups for the $5 bonus thinking to myself ""holy shit some people have been doing this for free all this time?"". If you werent able to figure out long pickups (and subsequently high AR) were a net loser then you deserve to get screwed with the new rates meant to ""help"" you. Don't worry guys, it's all just taxi and limo drivers spamming up the sub lol

Everything is FINE.  Move along lol"
I think I figured out the pay cut,3,42.99616773498831,Lyft,"I figured it out. The drivers that complained errrr asked to be paid while driving to the pax never thought Lyft would use it as a tool to decrease the per mile rate. I'm sure that drivers thought they'd get the same amount both ways. 

Lyft looked at it with the in house bean counters and figured out how to do 2 things. Raise their gross profit per ride and give drivers what they asked for. What they didn't see was the maelstrom of bad press. I keep reading the Lyft line ""We gave drivers what they asked for. To be paid en route to pickup a passenger.""","Yeah.

Is Lyft ignoring my (6th so far) request to have my account deactivated? Need for insurance purposes.,7,43.06268393871409,Lyft,"So far I've made 6 attempts to contact Lyft and have my account deactivated. They only respond with the generic, and quite useless, email saying they will get back to me. In a total of four days I have made these 6 requests.

Quite frankly, I'm tired of being ripped off by them and simply wish to no longer drive the 10 or so hours a week for them; my rate in Chapel Hill, NC and now Charleston, SC is just not worth it anymore and I'm essentially paying them for me to depreciate the value of my car on their behalf.

I have an opportunity to get full coverage insurance for less than 150 a month, and I'm definitely going to take it. However, I need to submit proof that I'm no longer doing rideshare. Uber took care of this for me in less than 5 minutes.

I'm starting to feel really petty right now, and if it's not done today (I managed to trick the app into calling them, so we'll see) I'm going to start accepting every ride and messaging riders, ""LYFT is charging you more and giving me less, pocketing the difference! PLEASE USE UBER to benefit us all"". Then I'll cancel the ride!

Any advice on how to actually get my account deactivated and confirmation of it being so, will be appreciated. I've reposted this from the Lyft Drivers reddit, because I'm not sure which is the most active.","How did your insurance company find out you did ride share?  Yes Lyft don't care what you want.

Accident/rental car/Flexdrive,6,43.13970940167705,Lyft,"In April I got an accident. Somebody from New Jersey bumped my car’s rear end while I was waiting for a green light on the Orchard street , Manhattan. She didn’t wait for a police, but she accidentally dropped her car’s plate. Police took this plate as a prove for this accident.

The Flexdrive charged me 500 dollars for the minor damage and told me that they will report this claim to the insurance and somebody will contact me. Nobody got in touch with me.
I went to the Flexdrive month ago. They told that the don’t see anything and yada yada yada. But this woman tried to do something in the system and she told me that now everything is fine and the claim adjuster will call me during this week.
I waited a month. I am gonna go to the Flexdrive again. Actually I am on my way to there. 
Does anybody happen to have an experience with Flexdrive or know how they handle insurance claims?","No experience with Flexdrive but the other one. This is not normal. At least I think your car is considered returned so you don't pay rental while it's being fixed.

Did you get her license and insurance details? She is automatically at fault so her insurance should pay everything and nothing for you. Unless she can't be found so you are paying the deductible (or less) anyway. 

The adjuster don't need to call you because they have the car. And you paid for the damage. And the car is returned.

I don't know if you state law cares about who's at fault. Check the police report who's at fault. And check with Flexdrive whoever insuring you if they have the other party's insurance policy. If they don't you follow up with police to find the other driver. Maybe the plate is fake so it's hard luck. After I reported my accident they called me before the end of the week to get all the relevant info for insurance. Never heard from them again. Five months later a totally different company that lyft works with contacted me and I basically had to start all over again. It took ten months total for the whole thing to be taken care of"
Hello I'm a new Lyft driver. I heard you're able to switch between filters but I'm unable to change between them. Why is that? I've only done about 7 rides now.,4,43.156109864640015,Lyft,Image,"Filters suck. Perhaps if you use it during busy times to get to a popular destination it may work. Experiment for yourself and you can find what works and use it to your advantage. However don’t expect it to send you exactly to your destination or even in the right direction.

They time out after a half hour and log you out of the app. You get six uses per 24 hrs and they seem to reset around midnight instead of the end of lyfts day at 5am, and far as I know can only set one filter at a time unless you are also driving for uber and then within the iber app you could also set a filter so you could potentially have two different ones running at once, but only one per app. If you cancel the destination mode but enter the same destination later, it may count as one use of the filter. So you can set up different destinations and the same ones may count as one, effectively switching among them. You can try it on a day that you don't really need 6. And do it soon before they cut it down to 2 or 3. You can hit top left X to switch back to normal mode.  Also be prepared to see low earnings as you arrived at a time of low earnings thanks to Lyft slashing rates down to .32c a mile Beware!  If you earn a Power zone bonus and your using a filter, you will lose your bonus if destination times out and app shuts off.  And filters timeout after 15 minutes not 30 minutes.  They also timeout quicker if you do not follow the the designated route.  

Uber filters can be altered and changed and last a lot longer than Lyft filters.  However, you only get 3 verse 6 with Lyft. There is sone strategy to using filters.   

At recent concert I wanted to ensure I was going to head north or west verse south or east.  While I scored a PPZ bonus of $20 on a surge at concert I had to be aware of destination timing out if I didn’t score a ride.  I wanted to use direction I chose because I knew it would be shorter and I would be able to return to concert to score another pickup.  Scored to Lux Black and I used a route  that took me away from traffic out of concert enabling me to get two rides. that was my reason for using destination.

There should be a way to tip a driver when you cancel.,3,43.22205893872513,Lyft,,"It’s called cash and we do appreciate the extra money. You can tell the driver to start the ride and do an ""early drop off"".  They will get the minimum fare and you will be able to tip."
Passengers aruging,23,43.295068197984385,Lyft,"This happened on my last ride last night.  A couple needed a 20 min ride home from the bar.  They get in. Everything seems fine then the guy starts berating the woman.  Saying this and that, and he just won't let it go.  Something about tipping the 22 year old waitress $15 after she didn't charge for drinks.  The girlfriend evidently made a offhanded comment before getting in the car that ""you'll never get with that"". Again these were his words. The woman was just sitting there attempting to diffuse the situation by asking to be silent the rest of the trip.  The boyfriend kept going.  He even threatened her a few times.

Besides this being a very awkward conversation that was none of my business except when it comes to the safety of my passengers since technically the girlfriend was the one who ordered the Lyft on the app, and the boyfriend just came for the ride.  Do I have any authority to interject about kicking the boyfriend out of the car if I felt his threats to his girl escalated?  I swear the way he kept bullying and making her feel like garbage, I was expecting them to break up right there in the car.  She was in tears when they left my car.  I felt so bad.  She even suggested she might stay at her mom's with how terrible the fight was.  I asked her as the boyfriend stepped out if she was alright and if she needed another ride somewhere.  I even said not to order another Lyft once I completed the drop off officially on the app.  I felt uneasy about my passenger safety.  

Could I have done anything?","I brought a passenger home and let her sleep in our guest suite after watching her dad physically force her out of the house after midnight. 

I listen to too many TrueCrime podcasts, so I *always* wait until my passenger is inside before driving away. In this instance, my passenger was forcibly shoved backwards before she could fully get in. A loud and somewhat physical argument ensued. 

For the next few minutes, I observed from the driveway, not knowing how to help or if I should. They were so loud, I kept hoping a neighbor would call police. 

Eventually I dialed 911 myself. The police were quick to arrive and forced the dad to let his daughter inside to get her stuff, but she was a wreck! 

Police told me the dad is a raging alcoholic and caused similar issues in the past with the girl's brother. 

When it was clear the police weren't going to do anything more than tell them to pipe down, I offered to drive the girl elsewhere. But she had nowhere to go and had to be at work at 7:00AM. 

I told her to grab her work clothes and offered to take her back to my house. 

I wasn't oblivious to the risks, but I could not, in good conscience have left her there. Plus I live with a 90lb Tibetan Mastiff and a 6'5"" Cowboy. 

She asked to borrow a phone charger that night and I half expected it to be gone in the morning... but it was laying on top of the neatly made bed with a heartfelt note of gratitude in the morning. She also left a nice tip in the app. 

We stayed in touch for a little while. She let me know when she'd saved enough money and finally got a place of her own. I hope that worked out for her and she never had to go back to her dad's. 

Unpopular opinion, but doing something is better than doing nothing. I think you did the right thing by offering her a ride. You have to feel out the situation to figure out how/when to intervene without escalating things. Though kicking him out would have been epic, it potentially could have put you both in danger. Youre best and only bet when the ride becomes unbareable is to pull over and ask them to leave. If someone were in danger, you could call the police or offer to take them (because its not a paid ride, your personal car insurance would kick in) however I recommend not getting involved in any way.

This exact thing happened to me and when the man started being verbally abusive to me, I pulled over, grabbed the phone/keys and got out not knowing if he might assault me from the back. Called Lyft and they credited me. Bottom line is its your car and you owe yourself safety and comfort first. People like this are dangerous. Offering her a ride after he got out was nice. She should have taken it. 

I'd have done the same, as I am also female and feel her pain. You can kick out any passenger if you don't feel safe. I once had a couple get in, they said hello and appeared to be a friendly couple. But moments later she started in on him, he said things back to her which made her more upset. I realized this wasn't going to end soon and it was a 35 minute trip. I should have asked them to get out but to be honest it was a damned good argument and I didn't want it to end lol... that is until shit got serious. They were in their mid 50's and had raised 3 kids, 2 of which were already in college. But that night in my backseat they agreed that divorce would be the best thing for both of them, which it probably would be after the shit they said to each other. Towards the last 2-3 mins of the ride she said she didn't want to be in the car with him anymore and proceeded to open her door as I was driving! He reached over and closed the door as I was slamming on my brakes, she told him to fuck off, slapped him then got out as I had pulled over at this point. He jumped out threw a $20 in the car, apologized then ran after her. I still think about them every now and then, I hope for their kid's sake they did get divorced. In scenarios like this one, you're better off staying quiet and not getting involved. Drop them off, 3 star them and move on with your shift.

Source: personal experience from something similar. You have every authority. You're in charge.

I stop arguments from escalating after a woman threw a drink I didn't realize she had at her husband.

They're children. Treat them accordingly. Sorry to hear about the drama. Not much you can do but stay out of it and get them where they're going. I had a similar incident where I picked up 2 young women who had just left a bar. Both were drunk and one was mad as hell at the other. The angry one sat in the front seat and turned to yell at her friend along the way. They kept changing destinations... arguing over going home or going for dinner. The angry one was the one who ordered the ride so I tolerated her ... not knowing anything more than they were fighting over something and I had no clue who to believe was in the right. It wasn't my job to know, really. They didn't damage my ride or threaten me. I felt bad as I dropped them off.  As they exited I said, ""thank you and please try and go easy. You're friends. Everything with be ok."" They were just about to go at it as I accepted the next ride and drove away."

She was civil enough to ask first and you just immediately cancel? You missed out on the $$ with a passenger who was cool enough to ask in advance. That's where I would call them and say it's not ok to vape in my car so they can cancel the ride before I even start driving towards them. I hate the smell vaping leaves in the car. The one time I allowed a couple to vape, the smell lingered for a few days. Never again. So if you’re posting pax names in this sub it’s cool if I start posting driver names right?

Lyft driver not returning phone,9,43.80474412392411,Lyft,Ive been going back and foward exchanging emails with lyft regarding a phone that the driver acknowledged finding and disappeared for a month and then changed his statement saying he did not find it i spoke to the driver when the incident took place and he told me he was getting angry and spoke incredibly rude before he hung up the phone and would not respond. Lyft said not worry and the would respond 24 hours later and did not lyft has been uncooperative this far and it has been 3 months im unable tl access my emails or contacts which has made it impossible for me to work and is affecting my personal life and i know i didn't loose it or misplace it anywhere else im 100 % sure the phone was found by the driver whom is not willing to return my phone and lyft is not protecting the interest of the costumer nor making any effort to work with me rather they make it seem as if there are actually trying to do the opposite by working against me.,"It's been 3 months since you lost it? Yeah, you're not getting that phone back, so you should figure out how to move on with your life. LOL That entire rant is just 2 sentences.   Amazing. There’s no going the extra mile to return your bullshit because we get paid 30 cents a mile even if someone is in the car 

So the driver is literally paying to drive for Lyft.  Hell no the driver isn’t going to driver to you out of the goodness of their heart even for 15 dollars

You need to bend over backwards to meet us at our convenience Uber and Lyft are not reasonable for lost items. 

The driver is not responsible for lost items. 

As a courtesy they will attempt to retrieve your lost items but ultimately it is up to the consumer to be conscientious of their own items.

If you let the driver know there is a $100 reward for your lost item that may make the wheels of progress start turning. Losing a phone happens to everyone, in fact some people I know are in the phone of the month club.  Assurant allows you to lose it 3 times a year and it's covered.  So how is it that your able to post to reddit and can't figure out how to get your email?  Let me guess, don't know any passwords?  Why wouldn't you just go get another phone and transfer the fucking number.  God, I think Id lose my shit if I had to deal with someone like you. I'll also add that if you have been without a phone for 3 months, you have no personal life to effect."

I don't feel comfortable allowing access to my computer and a recording of me being made while I test out a new app. It sounds fishy and too intrusive, but is this normally how user app evaluations are done?","Usertesting is a legit site, i do it sometimes. They do pay you to review webites and software, like a 1 person focus group. Take the offer! I make extra cash with them all the time Hover over the email address to make sure it actually appears as from @lyft.com, and isnt another email address masquerading as it. 

Otherwise, while the site may have negative reviews, it doesnt necessarily mean its a scam. Its common for software companies to choose users to test updates before they are released, and not unusual that they would compensate you for the time. Having it record your screen should not give it any information besides a video recording. Desktop?! That's a scam to give someone access to your computer.

No, maybe it isn't, bad reviews aside. Legit company. I test for them. Never had an issue getting paid, just kind of slow sometimes."

Jalopnik also conceded that there might have been selection bias for drivers unhappy with the cut being taken out of their fares.


You don’t say...... Take a look at what drivers post here. How many times do you see where Lyft or Uber took very little or lost money? Rarely. How many times do you see a post about where they took 9,000%? A lot. More than a lot, actually. 

They’re getting data from drivers unhappy with what was taken, so it’s no surprise that their “study” points the way it does. If they were to review *ALL* data, not just the cherry picked fares, I have a feeling that the study would paint a different picture. My average was 45% of what customers pay (pre-tip) went to me when I last calculated a bunch of rides.   The range I got was was 40-60% of the fare went to me.  This seems to say it's a bit better...but Seattle is a weird expensive market for them that's not typical at all.  We're still at $1.11/mi. The real data is what I expected based on my own experience. It's weird that they'd claim they make less than they do when communicating with shareholders, since if anything that would discourage them. I started driving for Uber back in 2015. I would easily make around $110 on a Thursday night after clocking out of my regular job. It was a sweet, rewarding gig. Then things, started slowly changing over time. Driver pay started to slowly decrease as competition was on the rise. Once I realized that I was not making at least $15 an hour after expenses, that's when I pulled the plug completely. It was fun while it lasted. Below is a message from Jalopnik, the *actual* source for this new report:

Passenger dented my door...,10,43.92698949432759,Lyft,"I’ve dealt with Lyft insurance once before, but it was for my own “at fault” damage. 

I pulled up to where a new shared passenger was standing, and he opened my door into the fire hydrant he was standing next to. He apologized and entered the car. I didn’t think it was hard enough to cause damage so I didn’t check until I had dropped everyone off. 

The seam on the edge of the door is folded in, but no paint damage that I can see. A block of wood and a hammer could probably get it pretty close to smooth. 

My question is... is it worth it? Lyft finally replied that they are sending my claim to insurance. Am I gonna have to eat the deductible even though my passenger caused the damage?","I would have taken it to a body shop for two estimates, one for out of pocket and one for insurance. Before you report it to Lyft.

It should be the pax's fault but you park close to the hydrant. For hit and run, you are still paying for the deductible if the at-fault driver can't be found. So if Lyft cannot recover anything from the pax, you are paying for it. It's different in different states and not everybody agree with me. You are likely screwed.   
Lyfts insurance is terrible and the people that work at the insurance company will not act on your behalf.   
They will just say something like the passenger said they didn't do it.   Further they will find you at fault for parking next to a fire hydrant. Why would u park like that? Everybody knows u should leave full space for the back right door to open. There is no space? It's ok to drive 50 meters away from the pickup point. It's completely ok to make them walk a few steps due to lack of parking, but its not okay to not leave them space to open the door.. i say this is completely on you Lyft insurance has a $2500 deductible (absolute joke) so clearly you are better off paying out of pocket. You could try to file with your personal insurance but unless it's like $250 deductible you are still probably better off paying out of pocket. Is it a $2500 dent?

You pulled up too close. Live and learn."
Can driver see destination if I schedule a day early?,9,43.963470975809074,Lyft,"first time lyft user, i have a meeting that is probably 35 mins away from my home.

&#x200B;

Will the driver be able to see the pickup and destination before accepting?","Just make sure you give yourself extra time for this.  I never rely on it solely.  So just in case the driver cancels/what not, you still have time to order a normal Lyft (or even Uber at that point) and be on with your day. Yes. We can see the full trip of scheduled rides. We see the general vicinity not the exact addresses Yes. Which is the opposite of Uber. That would be to easy. That cannot see destination. Yes, this is one of the key difference between uber and lyft. Drivers can see scheduled trip destinations to decide if they want to accept it or not. The only time this goes wrong is if a driver cancels on you, then the request goes out to the next available driver like a regular pickup which they cannot see the destination. If for some reason they didnt want the trip they could cancel again, although it's unlikely. Despite people all saying yes, they can ONLY see the destination if they go to accept your scheduled ride. Ive been in an area and dispatched to pickup a scheduled ride just cuz im the closer driver and in that case no we can’t see the destination till we arrive."
Monday Assholery,15,44.48857514247574,Lyft,"I usually take Mondays off, but this afternoon I decided to go out and see what I could get.

The first rider got into the car and said in a loud voice ""I was over there, not here. I don't pay Lyft so you can make me walk"".

I promptly told him to get out and cancelled. The jackass was literally sitting on his porch. I pulled up to the pin on the curb in front of his house. It was a :30 second walk at most, but apparently he wanted me to drive up to his porch and carry him into the car. WTF.

I then did two short rides without incident, and I got a ping from a woman who called me immediately and said the ride was for her boyfriend. I said ""Okay. I'm four minutes away"". And she responded with ""Why is it taking so long?.

I thought she had heard 'forty minutes' instead of four, so I reiterated that I was only four minutes away, and less than two miles. Then she says ""hurry up"" and hung up. Another ride cancelled. Learn some manners.

At that point I turned to go back home and got one from a girl at Cal Poly University. I figured that would be an easy one, and it was, until the end when for some reason she couldn't open the door and said in a weird voice ""I'm trapped"" and started banging on it. I looked at her and said the door in unlocked. Just pull the handle. She then got out without saying a word, and of course, slammed the door.

Lyft didn't send me their best today. I guess I'll (reluctantly) try again tomorrow.","And that's when I killed them your honor. Idk why it's hard for some people to open a door from the inside. So many times when we arrive, some people just pull the handle and expect the door to magically open by itself, and so many times I have to explain they have to push it out. Having been in retail for 10 years and Lyft for 2, this is what being on the frontline of customer service is-entitled assholes. Pro tip: don't let someone ride if the person who called the ride isn't riding with them. 

A scam has been going around where the original rider cancels after you've gone down the road without them in their car. You handled these well. Self respect is worth more than  the cost of a ride or two! The first two thought you were at their mercy. PWNED. 

And 😂 at the third one. sounds like New Jersey. Is that where this all occurred? See, that’s what I’ve noticed.  Giving ride share is God’s way of helping us to appreciate our friends and family more. We'll be happy it isn't Jersey. That's all I gotta say. People are relentless out here.

But also, now, we get paid for pickup in exchange for that. Idk how much I'd ge but in the past. I'd get $3 minimum for a ride and usually $12 for a ride that's over 10 miles away. Without considering gas. I'd make about $15.50 per hour. I usually drive for about 4 hours and that would get me about $62, then I subtract $15 for gas and walk away with $47.

I consistently average $25-$30 an hour. The Federal Government has determined that it costs, on average, $0.54 to operate a motor vehicle.

Uber And Lyft Take A Lot More From Drivers Than They Say,22,44.96318162398206,Lyft,Image,"I drive for lyft. It’s normal to see 50-70% go to lyft. I would like to find one lyft/Uber driver who is surprised by reading this Not surprising in the least. Don't miss driving for Lyft. Big up to Jalopnik for gathering that data and doing some real independent research. I echo the sentiment that no ride share driver is surprised by these findings, hopefully this will get the attention of the public and maybe government. They say we are independent contractors but the only thing we have full control over is our schedule(whether we work or not is something employees have as well so I haven't listed that like it's an IC privilege), after that the level of control they have is not much less than an employer. I always wondered how they get away with not giving all trip details in the request but I guess arbitration makes it more difficult to pursue a case. There probably needs to be a new worker classification for Gig work where there is a minimum wage higher than the employee minimum. Ideally for the work force we set rates and the app searches for drivers that matches how much the passenger wants to pay, if they can't find anyone they have to up their offer until they find someone.

Goodbye. Both are greedy stupid companies with no values and both will be eventually be worth as much as their values. Zero. It does not matter what they are taking or paying you, drivers continue to say they are ok with the way things are everytime they log in a accept rides. Don't like they way things are, don't log in and drive. So water is wet? Lyft is a scam. Don't use it. So I work at most 4 -8x a month for Lyft. Any more is a waste of time and so I found my sweet spot.im a freelancer so why act like an employee stuck at a dead end job? Seriously if you guys hate it,take a break or stop.

Yea, they screw people. But people are lining up anyway, so they will do it to the brink of our limits. It's the game, they hold the cards and make up the rules, but if we leave the table and enough leave with us, it can change things. But short term coming and going does nothing

Is it true that you guys don’t get payed for short rides?,26,45.782950142525415,Lyft,"So I took a 3 minute ride a few minutes ago. It cost me like $6.

Then she told me she probably wouldn’t get payed for this ride since it’s so short and I should just walk. I just laughed. She told me sometimes lyft doesn’t pay since the ride is so short. 

Is that true? Or was she just trying to guilt me into tipping more? Or something else? I did tip btw so even if Lyft didn’t pay her then she got a $4 tip","Not to my knowledge. 

But I have given tons of rides that actually paid less than the cancellation fee. False. She won’t get paid a lot, but she’ll get something. How short are we talking? I had a pax order a ride to go from the front of a mall half way down the parking lot. Maybe 400 feet. 
It was raining, but still 400’. I couldn’t hit end ride. It was too short. I had to drive half way around the mall and wait 5 mins to go far enough to trigger it to let me finish the ride. 

So if you are going very short distances, the answer is yes it can skip paying you if the driver doesn’t know how to do shit. 

Most know, drop off feet away, let the pax know you can’t stop the clock and it will take some time to get it to end. We do receive a minimum  base amount for short rides. Always. I do recommend that you tip even on short rides, because the minimum is not much, and in some markets, drivers are not paid for the time driving to you. Lyft is rolling out a new plan that has taken effect in many markets, wherein the driver begins earning from the moment they accept the ride. However this plan came with a significant slash to the per mile rate we are paid. (It's new to my market, so I'm reserving judgment at this point on whether it's better, worse, or the same, until I've driven on it for a few weeks.)  I think your driver was lying to you to trick you into tipping, and that is wrong. I still maintain that you should always tip your driver, but it was wrong of her to lie to you. What a rude driver. I had an early 20's woman get a ride 5 blocks for the same reason, she was nearly having a panic attack. the driver is being honest, however did not explain things correctly.  

Uber and Lyft are pitting riders vs. drivers.  Blaming riders for driver problems and blaming drivers for rider problems.  Here is what happened on your ride:

You paid: $6.30

Driver received: $2.45 (depending on the market...it's not higher than $3 in any market)

here are some examples:  [https://i.redd.it/mkutjt25aai31.jpg](https://i.redd.it/mkutjt25aai31.jpg)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/culstc/4060/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/culstc/4060/)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because Lyft and Uber insist they deserve 75% on short rides, drivers are institutionally tricked into taking these short rides and are usually disappointed when they are then allowed to see the destination...once they (lyft) or you (uber) have arrived.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

You shouldn't be forced to tip $4 to feel safe, or my favorite: to subsidize Lyft's 75% take rate.  Your driver was just lashing out at you because of the system them signed up for.  It's not you're fault, these are worldwide issues people are lashing against...do what you want to do! This is only true if it’s less than 0.5miles. Sometimes lyft will register it as a cancellation. I had to keep driving to complete the trip before. But regardless lyft will make >50% of your payment Two things can be the situation: 

A short ride only pays the minimum which in most places is between $2.50-$3.75. A lot of drivers understandably do not like essentially wasting their time on short rides. 

The distance is short enough that the drivers app will say the ride is too short and won't allow us to end it. I've had this happen where I ended it and I didn't get paid for this reason. I had to call Lyft support and get them to correct it. It would be the minimum fare,  but yes we get paid. False. unless you're only going about 20 feet, in which case Lyft registers the ride as a cancel. $3.75 minimum in SFBA. I'm sure she was  trying for the sympathy tip. Your driver is an idiot. You get paid for every ride. The only legitimate complaints drivers have about short rides is that after you factor in the time it took for us to get you we basically made nothing. Your driver was probably going to try and file a noshow fee against you the moment you left which would net her $5 instead of $3 and save her the gas and time of taking you on your short trip. Whatever you get charged she gets half unless you tip she gets all the tips She lied to you AND you tipped her. So no Yeah they are lying to you. Imagine caring about getting cat called enough to waste money to avoid it. Over never gotten less than $2.25 for a ride"
Lyft might be getting desperate here in Vegas. It’s the first time I’ve seen any kind of incentive in over 6 months. That probably means drivers aren’t driving. I’m definitely still not driving.,87,45.91650338327443,Lyft,Image,"Same moral dilemma here in Atlanta, I loved driving it was fun and nice to make instant extra money, but with the changes they have made the economic of it just don't work out anymore Just got the same text except I got $310 for 37 in the same time. Thursday and Friday when I was driving it seemed kinda slow but Lyft was saying that both days were super high demand... I swear Lyft is getting too desperate. I deleted their driver app altogether. I am only on Uber these days. And some Uber Eats on the side. I've been saying for about a month now, they can't keep this up.  They just can't.  If they do, as another poster said, they will go bankrupt or get acquired somehow, although I have no clue who would want to buy them.

I think by and large we can all agree that since personal power zones went live Nationwide, the volume of ride requests has dropped enormously, and nobody that knows what they are doing are working large events.  

While I think my analysis of the personal power zones and how and why they were designed to function is probably in the ballpark and more accurate than I realize, I should still be seeing them fairly frequently considering the times that I drive, and the frequency of uber surges. Uber and Lyft surges used to be connected fairly predictably. 

I've seen 2 in the past month.  In ATLANTA.  Prior to the IPO, I was seeing 6 or 7 A SHIFT. Earning guarantees are almost a $0 expense for Lyft, because the vast majority of drivers who complete the guarantee amount of rides will exceed the guaranteed amount. A small number of drivers will see maybe $10-$20. These guarantees are just another insult to drivers. They aren't worth nothing! They gave it to you because you aren't driving. How about they just give a damn bonus instead of the insulting earnings guarantee. I think Lyft is doing this because some drivers are one starring riders who do not tip. Running a driver promotion that has practically no risk for Lyft is pretty much the opposite of ""desperate"". It's probably based on you're average amount of driving and then you get squeezed out of your promotion. For what it’s worth, Uber is offering a similar promotion to me, a retired driver. $500 bonus for 50 rides. I got a similar offer here in chicago $380 min guarantee for 50 rides.   Thing is that I generally make that in 40 to 45 rides Call me old-fashioned, but where I'm from a week was a wee bit longer than four days... And at 25 you will stop getting pings, and everything before then is 20 mins to pickup for a 1 block ride My wife got a reminder from Lyft to “finish her application”....that she started FOUR YEARS AGO! This is in San Diego. She has a much much better job now.

Just thought it was odd- seems like they are desperate but they can’t lay down the hardcore “$5,000 bonus for 1,000 rides!” stuff anymore since they have to figure out a way to turn a profit and not absolutely destroy their stock price next quarter. $8.50/ ride guarantee, does that work out to $1 per ride above the average?

Great incentive. How much things have changed in just a year.

Edit: oh right, with the new rates, average ride will be like $4.50. forgot. Ironically, Vegas is probably one of the few markets where the new rates will make little difference. Especially if you're just driving up and down the strip. Ten minutes to go a mile, pick up a passenger, then another ten minutes to take them a mile down the street to the next mega-casino. lyft is taking advantage of people that do not understand how math works. plain and simple! Would having a class B license be important ? I have found that after expenses depreciation Etc you tend to make about 9 or $10 an hour, not bad, and many far worse jobs pay about the same or less, yet when you factor in the risk of using your own car your own insurance your own gas your own repairs Etc some days it seems hard to justify Why not driving? That's $8.5 per ride. It will hurt them more if you just do 27 short strip rides for the week rather than 0. And stop driving when they take it away."
Dash cam recommendations?,11,46.05426958697813,Lyft,"Looking for an affordable dash cam to record in-car activities and external stuff.

I need video documentation to protect myself if something goes sideways. 

Any recommendations?","Everybody's idea of affordable is different. The only recommendation that I have would be don't skimp. Research different models for feature comparison. Then narrow down at the price that you want to spend. Once you down to 3 or 4 models that you like check out reviews on each of them.

FWIW, I chose the Vantrue N2 Pro with GPS option.  It was more money than I initially wanted to spend, but it is superior to most anything out there. With a dash cam in plain sight, people tend to lock up out here like deer in headlights. The camera is there for my protection. I decided against getting a window mounted camera. Let's face it. If someone's going to rob me and they have half a brain cell, they're gonna take the camera if it's in plain sight. I use a rear view mirror cam. There are a good number to choose from. They're not too difficult to install. You're looking at $50-$300 depending on what you settle on.

I also use Drone Mobile. Tracks my vehicle via gps, has remote start and a few other functions. Google ""The beast ll"" dashcam. It has a great quality for its price. I use my galaxy s5 with a power bear 7800MaH after market battery and 128GB micro sd card, works great takes amazing video. Carway F30 it's  cheap, has 2 cameras with night vision takes a 32gb card max speaks engrish but the main takeaway is it lasted 3 Phoenix summers in the windshield and still records in 720p.

Restaurant Kitchen Worker Stench,6,46.39187375365584,Lyft,"I see drivers complaining about odors passengers bring into their cars, like cigarette smoke, marijuana, food smells, etc., but few people mention the stench that combines all of the above: Restaurant Kitchen Worker Stench.  


My first ride tonight was for a lady I picked up at Wing Stop. She smelled horrible. The stench kept getting worse as the 20 minute trip progressed. I even cracked my window at one point.   


I dropped her off and Lyft had already added my next ride, who was just 3 minutes away. I cracked all the windows, sprayed Febreeze, and prayed, but none of that worked. I told the next rider that  I would cancel if she felt the odor was too strong and she said it wasn't a problem -- but after a minute she also cracked her window open.  And that was a long 52 minute ride.   


The stench just lingered. I drove an hour back home, scrubbed the seat, went to Walgreens and purchased an odor remover, and it helped a little bit, but my night was done after only 2 rides. Hopefully it will be gone in the morning.   


People must know when they stink. I know I do, and I would never get in somebody  else's car like that. WTF.//","I somewhat regularly haul a kitchen guy from Buffalo Wild Wings. He generally cracks his window when he gets in without my prompting. Restaurant worker & lyft driver! I get this. But the worst smelling guest I had, was getting a lyft home from the beach. Crack the window? I opened the whole damn thing. For this reason I dont do pickups at any fast food place and typically not any restaurants when it's super late and clearly outside of business hours, like a 2am pickup at Joe's Shrimp Shack or something. While I don’t spray Ozium when a pax is in the car, I use it in between rides for this reason. Works great and the next pax will never know I about threw up from the previous rides stench. I can’t recommend it enough. In fact, this is all I use because I try to keep my car scent free since a lot of people have allergies to many scents. https://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2011/09/your-best-air-freshener-isnt-air-freshener

I tilt up the moonroof or turn up fan speed for my activated carbon cabin filter, or both. 75% of those I pick up on a daily basis are commuting to and from work. A lot work in the food industry. A lot of smokers and tokers. All types of smells have entered my vehicle, including eye watering BO that might cause some to prefer sticking their head up a skunk's ass as an acceptable alternative.

I use the Dr. Scholl's ""Odor-X"" spray. Works surprisingly well. I do 3-4 sprays, let it circulate, then open the windows to get rid of the chemical smell. I buy the generic $1.88 leather & misc wipes from Walmart. I get giddy when I see free 24/7 vacs (What's HAPPENING to me!?) I'm not a fan of shitty air fresheners. The wipes do a nice job of giving the vehicle a clean smell. Most everyone compliments my vehicle. This only satisfies my curiosity when it comes to cleaning. 

I use front floor mats that I've trimmed down to fit nicely in the back. They have a nice lip around them just in case my pax regrets drinking that last 6 pack. Or, you know, they managed to step on every dog turd in a 10sq/mile radius.  


If you have cloth interior, I'm guessing some smells will soak in. You know. Those 2am, drunk wet farts. Dunno how to help you there. Complimentary diapers."

Don’t let your night become as shitty as mine.","Now you understand why people don't take dogs. Wait, they denied a cleaning fee because you accepted another ride?... Ugh! I am so sorry! I have a small yorkie terrier mix and I ALWAYS call the driver ahead and let him know I'll  cancel if he doesn't want the dog in the car. 

Then, when I do find someone will take him, I keep him on my lap at all times AND put my arm across the window so when he's looking out the window his nails aren't scratching the door.  

People like your passenger make me so upset. People like them are why it's hard for me to find someone willing to take the dog. How did they know you got another ride? I just go to help and type in who and what damage. Sometimes the next day if I'm super busy. [removed] I just see the people with dogs and I keep driving ..until they cancel .

How early should a ride be scheduled,8,46.5738297721854,Lyft,"I realize this is going to mostly be chalked up to #ruralproblems but Im really stumped on how pre-arranged rides should work.  I scheduled 3 rides on Thursday ahead of time for my fiance. One for yesterday at 7:20pm to pick him up from work and bring him home, one for 6:20pm today to take him back to work, and again for tomorrow 6:20pm to work. 

Yesterday it showed drivers confirmed for today and tomorrow. 

Yesterday no driver accepted the ride until 845!  I had just managed to get a coworker to go get him when they got off so we canceled the ride. 

I thought today would go better because a driver was supposedly confirmed but at 6:15 that no longer showed up, at 6:20 it sent a massage saying a driver was on the way...and would arrive in 40 freakin minutes.  What is the point of pre scheduled rides if the driver isn’t there on time. How far ahead should you have a ride scheduled to make it to work on time?  

Im really worried for tomorrow. The latest I can take him is 2 hours before he is scheduled and he works 12 hour shifts so that would really suck.  Has anyone else experienced similar. Did you solve it and if so how?

TIA for advice.","Your better off just going on ahead of time 30 mins and requesting the ride.  The schedule function is a waste of time..  your scheduled driver can have Lyft sending him rides even if he has one scheduled... So the whole system sucks and doesn't work. Lyft scheduled rides are more likely to be claimed and have a drivers actually adjust their schedule for it when the ride works for them.  For example, it earns the driver a good fare (longer distance), drop-off location is an airport (auto rematch to skip airport queue) or in a good area for additional rides.   A scheduled ride toward a rural area probably wouldn’t be desirable for a driver unless he/she is going home at end of day.
Lyft drivers can see any unclaimed scheduled rides near their current location, but they have to have their driver app on.  It is also harder to see when in driver mode (extra steps to get to and never when on a current ride). So, it is sometimes random for drivers to see a scheduled ride pop up for them to claim. What ended up happening with the driver that was 40 minutes away?The 40 minute arrival time was probably a driver that claimed your scheduled ride in advance, but had other rides that took him/her to far to make it to your location.  Driver probably accepted the ride request ping without realizing it was the scheduled ride (now to far away) or it was automatically added to driver’s queue if currently driving a passenger.

"Second night driving ever, I get puked.",10,46.72460523516216,Lyft,"I picked up a passenger and her friend at a bar late around 1. We start going for a while but just as I'm getting on the highway her friend says ""I gotta pull over soon.""  We're going through a tunnel with no breakdown lanes so I tell her to wait 2 minutes till we get off. Nope, she got sick and started puking. I gave her a bag but some of it got on my car seat and floor anyway. ""I think it's mostly on her jeans"" the passenger kept saying but she was wrong. When we arrived to the destination I immediately started cleaning because I didn't want it to set into the fabric.  I poured my water and half a bottle of Isopropyl onto it to water it down then I soaked it up and scrubbed with a towel from the trunk. I took out the floor mat and rinsed it off.   Her friend had already gotten out of the the car to puke again but fell off her shoes stumbling backwards. She was lucky she didn't put her head through the picket fence next door she fell against.  She was so drunk, the passenger  needed my help walking her to the door.  ""I'm so sorry"" the drunk one says,  guess I should've been more pissed but I was genuinely worried if I let her go she was gonna smash her head on the pavement.  I get her in there then leave. 20 mins later I get back on the highway to go home.  Not like I could get anymore work in with a wet backseat that smells like puke. Then I remembered I forgot my floor mat on the ground in between cleaning and helping.  I turn around,  another 40 minutes wasted.  I get home to see my glorious reward in the form of  $3.26 tip 😂.  If she left me a $10.00 I was willing to forget *everything* but 26 fucking **cents** ?! Why not a whole fucking dollar?  This was maddening. 

I wake up the next day to see if maybe she added more now that she's sober but no. So I go through the motions with LYFT but since I don't have pics I get ""Without the information above, we’re unable to recover a damage fee from the passenger.""  Fantastic. 

Then the real kicker is that I have a dashcam that does capture audio.  I was hoping maybe if I present them with  audio of this girl puking it might help but when I go to scan it today I get ""VIDEO ERROR"" and it's the *only* clip of that night that doesn't work.    I don't think I turned on the microphone anyway but maybe it had video of me helping her to door or something. That last bit of hope was the dagger. 

It's like I was destined to be fucked.  Now *I'm* going to get really drunk and forget all about this horseshit. Cheers!","The absolute first thing you do is take pictures BEFORE you start cleaning. And take like 20 with different angles and all the areas with damage. Man you did everything wrong.

Lucky ladies You acted as a decent human being, and like you said it’s your second night driving. I’ve been nervous about getting a puker, so I’ve been ending my shifts around 11:00pm hoping that I’d miss the main drunk hours. I’m sorry this happened. I remember my first puker. Girl got sick everywhere. The girls friend thought it was so funny. I let her laugh knowing she’d be charged $100 since she was the one who ordered it. They got out without saying anything. No apology, no tip, no common courtesy. . .

Anyway, this is probably the worst and least lucrative time to become a driver. Stop while you’re still ahead. Don’t let the appeal of “quick money” deceive you!

Check out [ride.lyft.com](https://ride.lyft.com) and drag the pin around on the map (much easier then the phone app) to get an idea of driver saturation. Let me tell you, Philly is swarming.   


If you're driving tonight - find some bars that close 11-12am and hope for some hoppers. Make sure you're parked somewhat close. It may be beneficial to stick with the herd starting off (at least on weekends). Learn an area and the hours of every establishment that serves alcohol.

So because my contractor just took his word without any proof I am out of a job and forced to job hunt, again. But I just moved in with someone(roommate) and I cant afford to be on the street especially since I have a small dog who already has anxiety around others(So I dont want to have to give her away and most likely know they will put her down due to it). So despite how much I dont want to I will have to sign up for Express Drive. I know of the fees and what not and currently I need to make at least 400 a week(Will do this full time) after the fees taken out for the rental and what not and also including gas to make it. I believe that is a realistic goal as I checked my Lyft logs from 2018 and I generally made that in 30 hours in my city and I wasnt really pushing myself like that during that time and I was choosy with rides. Though I would have to do a little more just to make sure I cover the rental fee.

&#x200B;

Any who, my question is what has been your experience doing this recently and do you think it is doable? I currently live in the DMV area so there is MD, DC, and VA to profit from. Also, is there anything I need to look for when getting a rental besides tire pressure and nicks on the car?

&#x200B;

Edit:  


Btw I am looking to do this for no more than 2 and a half months. I figure that should be enough time to find a decent job and not have to depend on this.","Instacart actually has a referral bonus atm that is pretty high if you're looking to join the gig economy.  First step my  friend to joining the gig economy - get the BEST referral bonuses so you can cash out after your first 30-days with every app you try. I would expect to drive 10-14hrs/day, 7 days a week with Express. If you get stuck with a honkin' V8 SUV, expect 20-40% of your gross to go directly into your gas tank.   


A good weekend could easily bring in the $240\~ for your weekly Express rental fee, leaving weekdays as your bread and butter. Even so, a realistic expectation is $7.50/hr, mon-fri. It's not pretty. From what I've seen, express drivers have a different(lower) pay rate than us who own our cars. If you are still signed up as a driver then go to the driver site and check the rate cards. I've also seen some funky requirements like a 90% acceptance rate; that's unrealistic while remaining profitable. Overall it's very dodgy but might be an OK short-term solution."
Creepy Driver... Possibly the worst vibes ever encountered...,24,47.22179273518424,Lyft,"So I take Uber and/or Lyft daily (several times a day in fact) I am not picky, I simply recognize that point A to point B is pretty much all that matters. I always tip... And almost always rate 5 stars. A few occasions (maybe 6 times total over my nearly 3 years of Uber/Lyft have I gone with 3 stars or below) 
This morning I finish my shift it's about 745am Uber is tied up and the system has a driver ETA approx 18mins away, so I pull up my Lyft. (I work 12 hour shifts and coincidentally last night took in 4 hours of OT so I was ready to get the hell out of here) Here I have a discount anyways and the driver is just 4mins away. Driver arrives, everything is going smoothly, my ride is only 7mins long... Min 5 hits, literally a block away and another driver upsets my driver, he claimed she cut him off maybe she did I honestly didn't see, but he became enraged, swearing and just pissed. So now my guard is up, he apologized for his ""bar mouth_ and then proceeds to ask if I have ever been to such and such bar downtown. Just as I try to politely answer another driver passing the opposite direction he felt was too close to his vehicle so he swears, lays on the horn and swerves like only an asshole can... So now I'm white knuckling and I see my home, he makes that final turn apologies again... Then proceeds to invite me to coffee while making some very perverted comments on how my uniform is attractive and how he likes women in scrubs... I'm like ok thanks please open your door.... Meanwhile I'm politely blowing him off while frantically pulling the door, now I'm digging through my backpack looking for something I can use for a weapon, but all I could find was a glass Snapple bottle half empty from dinner... It will do... But just as I started to escalate in fear he unlocked the door and I ran the fuck outta there... My keys by in hand, he continues to proposition me for drinks or dinner as I enter my home then he just sits outside the house for about 5mins before leaving, I watched terrified from the blinds... So I one starred him and no tip which I pretty much never do... The dude felt like a Gacy or Dommer vibe was happening... Like I was one step away from ""It puts the lotion on its skin"" status.... Wtf is a girl to do here? Report him or am I just overreacting?

TLDR: I was almost a feature on Investigation Discovery, pretty sure my Lyft driver is a rapist at the very least if not murderer... What shall I do about it? One star and end it or report the creeper?","Definitely report him, he should never have been hitting on you #1 but #2 his crazy driving is going to get someone killed I'm sorry that happened to you. I'll never understand how some people can be so clueless about boundaries and reading people. Just drive and offer a safe ride. It's not that hard. Report that scumbag and make sure you let Lyft know that you felt very unsafe. His behaviour is inexcusable. Yes. Report him for sure!! Luckily I have never felt uncomfortable in a Lyft before but i did just buy a small switchblade just in case. Having the doors locked is a huge concern and very creepy. My car locks the doors when you put it in gear but unlocks when you put it in park again but yeah his actions seem very suspicious and you should totally report him You definently should have called the cops as soon as you got inside your home and make a complaint to Lyft. His behavior definitely wasn't one anyone should be in guy girl or whatever. Even if he has a right to get mad/upset he shouldn't have cursed or yell etc if anything keep it to himself and let it go after dropping you off. Its disgusting how he tries to get you to go out with him... um so yeah do the above mentioned. Did he have the child lock engaged so you couldn't unlock and open the door yourself? God, this has happened to me before too. Once, I took a Lyft home really early in the morning from the hospital where I had been there all night, sick to death. My driver hit on me the whole ride home, despite knowing that I had been sick in the ER and even still had my hospital bracelet on. He just wouldn't take no for an answer and I felt I could've been taken advantage of because I was still loopy from the medicine I had been given. He just gave me those kinds of bad vibes.

When I finally got home, I reported him right away and gave him one star. No idea what happened after that, but I hope he was deactivated. any proof of these acts? Report him to Lyft as an unsafe driver. I would also file a police report and tell Lyft that you’re doing so. Hopefully that will encourage them to deactivate his account. You aren’t overreacting. Many Lyft drivers are not very stable people. I recently posted in this sub the reasons why I don’t tip as a way to explain to these guys why the majority of people don’t tip (it’s because most lyft riders are former bus riders, we’re expecting a bus experience not a taxi experience)

You tip and that’s great but Lyft doesn’t monitor driver tips - it doesn’t give rewards to drivers with a lot of tips or retrain drivers who don’t get tips, so while your tips are helping the driver pay his bills, they’re doing nothing to help the driver or you have a good experience in future rides. 

Anyway I said all that in this sub and one of the responses implied that I’m going to “get shot” soon. So just remember take care of yourself - these drivers are not predisposed to like you. 

Best of luck, and please report this guy! are you sure you’re not over reacting and about to financially ruin a socially awkward man who doesn’t know how to talk to females? the road rage part is unacceptable tho, report him for that, at least."

I'm a rider. I always rate five stars but I never tip. Here's why [long post],51,47.800426994479366,Lyft,"TL;DR I don't tip because Lyft drivers tend to be pushy about talking to me, they don't have a job-related incentive to earn tips, and when they ask riders to leave a tip because their wages are too low, they make me not want to not use Lyft, even though I often have no other choice.

Here are the top five reasons why I don't tip my Lyft driver:

1. Your competition is the bus, and honestly I prefer the bus. It's bigger, it's cheaper, and I like walking so I don't need to get \*exactly\* where I'm going. Also I don't tip my bus driver for a service I \*prefer\* to Lyft, so it doesn't make sense for me to tip my Lyft driver.
2. Drivers are way too pushy with conversation since the rates went down. If I have my earbuds in, don't talk to me. If I don't answer your 10,000 questions, stop talking to me. Your competition is the bus, where the driver isn't even allowed to chat up passengers.
3. Lyft drivers scam riders on a daily basis. Just read any of the posts by riders in this sub, and it's only gotten worse since Lyft cut driver pay. Not once has the bus company charged me a $15  ""lost item"" fee for something I didn't lose, or a ""cleaning fee"" for a mess I didn't make. While I am sorry that your pay got cut, drivers taking it out on riders just makes you all look bad, so why would I tip someone who might very well try to scam me later? 
4. I worked as a waitress for five years. During that time of course I earned tipped income, usually around $100 per five-hour shift. I worked HARD for those tips, and part of that hard work was reading people: knowing when to be chatty, when to be quiet, etc. However, the biggest reason why my tips were consistently good was my boss. In California, employers are required to keep a record of your tips. So when my tips were under $50, my boss would take me aside and talk to me about how to improve my performance.  As tips don't affect Lyft driver job status or performance reviews, etc., I have no incentive to give them to you.
5. Almost every other post on this sub is someone complaining that if they don't earn tips, they can't meet expenses. I've heard waitresses make similar complaints, but they also acknowledge that tips are not a stable source of income, and asking the customer to treat tips like regular wages just makes the customer angry. Why? Because that customer is now patronizing a business that doesn't pay its workers a living wage, and that sucks. No one wants to hand over good cash money to an employer who mistreats their workers. Unfortunately, while there are a gazillion restaurants to choose from, the same can't be said for transportation.  Where I live, once the buses stop running it's either take Lyft/Uber or get raped and mugged walking through the bad area of town to get home. I would take a taxi, but the evil Lyft/Uber companies put the taxi companies in my area out of business years ago.

So that's why you're not getting tipped.  If you want this situation to change, you need to do everything you can to make the rider feel safe. I've never cared about water bottles or chargers or a super clean car, and no I don't want to tell you about my day. I would say given how much riders are getting scammed it might be nice to give riders a little card telling them exactly what to do if they have any kind of problem. At least that way you are letting them know that you're one of the ""good ones"". Aside from that, drivers should be pushing Lyft to immediately deactivate any drivers who scam riders. That would probably help your tip rate as well.

Or you could continue to post in here that all riders are stingy assholes, but I don't think that will help with your tip rate.  Anyway, best of luck!","The one and only reason: you're CHEAP! This is a really weird post. Why did you decide to make it? It contains no useful or actionable info for any driver who might have the misfortune of reading it. I hope your drivers leave you in the rain, take the bus if it's so great.
You dont tip because you're poop and try to justify it. r/youaretheasshole Wow just wow is all I can say It’s sad you have such a bad attitude towards tipping your drivers. 

Seems like you should just stay riding the bus. This is so fucking stupid a just can't lol. Why on the Earth are you comparing bus drivers and the Lyft drivers? You don't need to tip a bus drivers cuz they have bunch of benefits like health care and they are making THE WAY MORE MONEY AN HOUR than any Uber or Lyft driver. 

They are driving transport authorization vehicles that they are not paying a dime for.
While ride share drivers letting you in in their cars, after you were sitting your ass God knows where and making their back seats dirty every time people like you are getting in. 

I was a waiter back in the days and I know how to ""read"" customer so I don't bother people when I see it and I'm always trying to be chatty when people in a good mood.

Even tho if you'd say to me before getting into my car that you don't have money for a tip, I would let you and I would try to give you a nicest ride.
But if you'd say shit like this, like you said all above I'd probably just kick you out in the middle of nowhere and cancel the ride. 

And please delete the Lyft app, you are not deserve to use and have it on your phone.
Thanks. Out of curiosity, if a driver meets all of your criteria (assuming they somehow know what those are) would you tip then? I don't see how it's much different than any of the other services you used as examples wherein you have the potential to be pleased. Or am I missing something? 1. Why don't you take a bus always? Do us a favor please!

2. Service and tips are personal but you generalize, which is an oxymoron or just a moron.

3. You should shoot everybody that you see because some human being like to shoot other people and you can prevent that by shooting first.

4.  You try to make sense out of non-sense. If some drivers are good at reading people, they could have become a better paying waiter. Or a psychic. And it is Lyft's fault that they don't care how little tips some driver gets.

5. Lyft sucks. You have no choice but to use it. So you should consider that you have no choice but to tip so you are not as evil as them.

Luckily, drivers can rate you base on how you tip. If you are afraid of karma, you should switch to Uber So you think companies exploiting their employees by forcing them into a tip-based structure is the employee’s fault? 

Servers AND Lyft drivers don’t have a choice, there is no option to work in the industry and not be tipped, and if you have a delayed sleep phase like I do, job options that won’t literally kill you with slew deprivation are few and far between.

You sound like an entitled a**hole who is privilege blind and ignorant, and cheap.

Just say “I’m an a**hole who won’t tip and will use mental gymnastics to justify it” and save us the long post.

Go f***ing ride the bus then if you prefer it so much. What? There's just so much wrong with this post I wouldn't even know where to begin. Lol That's a lot of words to tell the world you're a cheap person. And you worked in the tip industry? Rename this top 5 reasons you’re justifying to yourself why you’re acting like a jerk. 

Look, tip or don’t tip but keep quiet about it. Nobody needs your rationalization. I think the majority of Lyft riders don’t usually tip.  So would all the comments chastising OP for not tipping apply to the majority of Lyft riders? I don’t tip either but I’d never make a post exposing what a cheap loser I am After a random hobo picks a fight with you on the bus and absolutely demolished your bus experience you’ll come running back to Lyft/uber. 

But you can always take a traditional taxi. You're a cunt a cheap smelly cunt loser waitress! So you had some bad experiences and now all Lyft drivers are schemers? Eat my ass, you’re equal to a racist you bag of queef. I don’t care if u tip, either way my bills will be paid, it’s more fun to help than to drive around being a farquaad You are a horrible person.   I'm certain everyone that knows you feels the same way.   I hope all the bad things life come your way. [removed] You worked in the service industry but still refuse to tip? #stayclassy"
Lyft background check question,4,47.94473255003492,Lyft,"Hey everybody. 

I applies yesterday to be a driver, and I'm awaiting the return of my background check. 

I guess it doesn't matter by this point but I'm curious if this will fail me: about three years ago I got a speeding ticket, 81 in a 55 (truthfully I should have been arrested, but it was a bright, sunny day on an open highway and the officer was very nice). I was able to get a deferral for that ticket, which, as it was explained to me, would dismiss the ticket if I kept my nose clean for the next 11 months. Which I definitely did.

&#x200B;

I also got a non-moving violation when I was 17. I took a defensive driving course and that was dismissed.

Does anyone think these tickets will be an issue? Thanks for any input!

Sorry about the throwaway.","No you're fine.  They don't care about speeding tickets if you just got 1 3 years ago

Looks like lyft will be sending me a fat check for this guarantee 1,000 at this rate.",37,48.18058903154124,Lyft,Image,"Does the guarantee only apply if you actually hit 125 rides? Like, if you only get 80 rides by 9/20, does the guarantee not apply??? I feel like Lyft is shady where they won't let you hit that 125 rides. No ones tipping, man. I just dont get why the tip difference ratio between both platforms are so astronomically different. This is why its ludicrous to meter our rates based on a presumption that riders are tipping. They are not. That's $10.25 (gross) per hour. Assuming you had to pay for gas and knowing that your car depreciates more with mileage, and will require more frequent oil changes because of driving it more, it seems you'll come out to about $3 an hour at most.

Damn, Lyft. You will 124/125 and then never ping for the final one. Nice work! You came out negative in all reality. Why don't you show us what Lyft made on these 11 rides.  Just on platform fee alone they are close to what you you made...  They got you hoping for that 1000.   Without it, you'd be like WTF.  They are clearly using their driver's.   It's as clear as crystal your making less than minimum wage. because you know exactly how to drive rideshare, you know where you are supposed to be and when you are supposed to be.  Magically, you were born with an innate ability to sign up for rideshare, and just know exactly how to make a lot of money. ""Drove for the first time"", there is where the problem starts. The guarantee is if he does 125 rides he will earn at least $1000. Lyft isn't paying anything out. Let me understand this. The OP earned only $42 roughly for doing 11 rides on almost 4 hours? That's less than $4 per ride. Half of what you made is going towards gas. SMH. I'm glad I never signed up. Too much work for nothing When I drove lyft, I would often seek these bonuses (but never had one this big). And it was always (we’d pay you the difference). 


I’d normally get nothing but short rides that pay$2.  

So on something like this, lyft would owe me 700$! In theory.  

But in reality lyft would always ALWAYS give me less and less rides and the rides I would get would all be long and spendy.  Thus I’d always make close to amount of the bonus anyways, so lyft would often not be obligated to bonus me because I made the amount of money. Get it Get it Mane. Get that fat check. Are you still planning on driving after this $1000 guarantee or too soon to say? Guarantee means: if you make $850 on those 125 rides, Lyft will then give you a $150 ‘bonus’ to make up for the rest of the $1,000."
"Lyft app said I was ""picked up"" when the driver was still miles away, charged me for the trip, and won't even acknowledge that's a bad experience",12,48.3651144945042,Lyft,"Genuine question, what's the point of granting the Lyft app access to my location (iOS) if they can't even tell if I was even near the driver or not? How could I possibly get ""picked up"" when the driver was miles away, and could I possibly be ""on a trip"" when I haven't moved an inch?

&#x200B;

Clarification: I did NOT make any mistake in my request. Everything (pickup location, dropoff location) were entered correctly. Somehow the driver and Lyft app said I was picked up from somewhere far away from my requested pickup location and that happened about 10 seconds after getting a Lyft notification saying that the driver would be arriving in 7 mins.

&#x200B;

It's insulting when the Lyft app kept asking how I feel about the pickup, how I feel about the trip etc. when I was stranded and was trying very hard to get in contact with either the driver or Lyft customer support (to no avail).

It's infuriating to the point of almost hilarious when I tried to dispute the charge for this ride that started without me and the Lyft app shows a message saying ""We didn't notice anything wrong with this ride.""

&#x200B;

I think I at least deserve a simple ""sorry"" from Lyft or at least acknowledge the mistake on either the driver or Lyft's part (I think mostly Lyft for how bad the app is designed) but nah. Well if that's the attitude of Lyft, I know that's one ride-share service to never use again.","Because your phones gps only shows where the person who ordered the lyft is on the drivers map. It doesn't, y'know, change the fact you can drop the pickup pin anywhere in the world. You should have cancelled when you noticed the mistake after verifying pickup pin and address were incorrect during the ride request. If I were you I won't do anything involving co-riders in the future. And I will accept mistakes instead of challenging Lyft on what should be impossible.

If you were on the trip you could cancel (at least for Uber) or report trip issues then."

It's just that if I had a driver take me to another city I would def feel obligated to tip at least something, especially considering that you can afford to shell out $64 for that ride."

Perhaps he should have used an example of something more than a $3 difference. This applies to both uber and lyft:

I am not sure what city you are in, 

but if you want to know what is coming, just look to cities like Los Angeles (where i am)

LA used to pay well, now during slow times, drivers are making $8/hour or less (and waiting 20,30 even 40 minutes between rides is not uncommon here).

even during a busy day, averaged out, drivers are making less than minimum wage (LA minimum wage is $14/hour)

Not counting gas or any other costs, Los Angeles ride share drivers are making between $12-15/hour.

After costs, drivers probably take home about $10/hour

In LA, it used to be common for drivers to make about $30/hour (now we make a third of that).

and not only that, both companies are advertising heavily to hire new drivers and both are adding all the drivers they can.  This means more and more drivers, and more and more down time for existing drivers.

You cant even drive for either company is you dont also have the passenger app to look at, too (so that you can at least try to not wait in an area with a down other drivers all on the same block)

its basically going to get worse and worse, until it becomes like picking crops in the field, a job that only illegal aliens and those who are ok with working way below minimum wage will do (and yes, many of the drivers in LA are undocumented aliens, there is no citizenship or even legal status required to work for lyft or uber) Any state that issues drivers license to illegal aliens (such as california) is a state where undocumented aliens can work and drive rideshare.

Here in LA, for a variety or reasons, rates are going down, down, down, and unless the government makes them pay minimum wage, its only going to get worse from here on out. Yep and people are lined up to drive at least here in South Florida they are. Turn on the rider app and there’s cars all over you. The company can only get away with what people allow. I drive very part time sometimes only on my way home from work to help pay the gas since I’m driving already. I made $10 for a 20 mile ride today, woo! Here I make 25 cents per mile A rant with no substance, how original. What a terrible video."
Worker bees are still buzzing after new terrible Minneapolis market rate slashes.,5,49.09953579084465,Lyft,Image,"After they see how much less they are making, I bet they stop soon. This is just the first full day with the new rates. They are driving around for .32c a mile.  And thus is just one area, each new area on the map had many more bees Oh now there finally dummies.  People have been bitching about pay forever and you get the well nobody is forcing you to drive shit.

I guess some woke up, but there will always be crack like addicts looking for their next ride.  You can't stop the stupidity."
Don’t use lyft in Knoxville Tn,5,49.208829772326126,Lyft,They are now charging customers surged prices and not paying the driver for it,">	Don't use Lyft ~~in Knoxville Tn~~

FTFY. They're doing this shit everywhere. [deleted] Doesn’t that sort of undermine the whole point of surge pricing?"
Driving in Philadelphia,6,49.25529967974457,Lyft,"I just started driving in the Philadelphia/S. New Jersey area, however it seems to be really slow and I'm not getting very many requests at all. Where are the best areas to drive and the best times?","best advice is to un-install the lyft driver app. you can thank me later! Im not in philly but I had the same problem when I started. I went and joined the airport que. Use the time that you wait for a ride to talk to some of the other drivers in the lot and see what they normally do. Plus the airport que is a guaranteed ride and will ease you into driving more so then riding the streets I live in Philly and drive Uber/Lyft in the area too. Honestly, try and apply for Uber. Lyft can occasionally be busy but I find Uber tends to have more traffic. Also, PPZ is a complete joke. Whereas Uber will have the sticky surge clouds consistently and large enough to be able to get some, Lyft will only have the heat zones with NO SURGE while they charge passengers the original Prime Time multipliers. And if you do get lucky enough to score a PPZ, I've never seen it go past $6 (and it almost never happens).

I tend to have both Uber and Lyft on when I drive and there is no surge for either. Keeps me busy. I regularly make between $19-28/h. I drive during the day primarily between 7am-7pm (only do at most 8h, so some days I start at 11am, others I start early and end early).

Center City/UC has a lot of requests but you also will have a lot of competition. East Falls/Germantown/West OakLane tends to have pretty decent requests and you tend to go further and make more. South Philly can have a decent amount of requests. 6am-10am you get the morning rush/commute. 2pm-7pm you get the afternoon rush/evening commute. After 8pm you are less likely to get rides. 10pm-2am you got the bar crowd (I personally avoid this time).

Philly area rides tend to be closer. In S Jersey, you're more likely to drive further distances to pick up passengers. The rates are better in the PA region over Jersey region. Driving in Philly should be a rape charge against Lyft. Hopefully Tryp will get here soon."
Lyft Has Been Flooded With Sexual Assault Lawsuits,0,49.49485986492976,Lyft,Image,No Comments
"Lyft Driver hits passenger after Dropoff, Lyft ignores contact attempts by passenger",24,49.51424643901763,Lyft,"Hey all. Last year my best friend was hit by a Lyft driver after said Lyft driver dropped her off. My friend's had one hell of a time trying to deal with the medical bills that are piling up. The cops didn't do anything after taking the report and Lyft has continually ignored her attempts to call and email them over the course of a year. My friend's not the type to make a fuss necessarily and hates confrontation, but feels that her hand's been forced to call attention to the issue via social media. 

The entire incident was caught on two security camera feeds, [you can see it on her instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1XPAC3nOT6/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet) 

>This happened last year during finals.  My entire left side was bruised and I had a spinal injury akin to whiplash. I’ve recovered after several months of physical therapy but medical care isn’t free in America. I’m getting billed for it and the bills are piling up and gaining interest. I can’t afford to pay and @lyft or their insurance won’t return my calls or emails. Their insurance company claims to have no idea what I’m talking about and that they don’t represent @lyft. Lyft customer support says that the insurance company is handling it. So I’m clearly being hustled. I didn’t want to put anyone on blast but I can’t be financially responsible for a multimillion dollar company’s mistake. 

I'd like to know the driver has been removed from Lyft and corrective action was taken in regards to their license. From the other video feed, it seems the driver was looking at their phone in their lap when they moved forward, and kept going until they realized my friend was on the hood.  It's not just a light bump, either. Mind you, my friend has neon rainbow hair in long box braids. The doctor was stunned that someone could claim they didn't see her. 

My friend is looking into getting legal aid.  She's had to quit going to school because she was unable to lift anything and her entire life was put on hold. I find the entire incident unacceptable, so I'm making some noise on social media. I'd appreciate it if you tell Lyft your thoughts on that and make sure they can't ignore it any more. And if you know anyone who's been in a similar situation, we'd love to hear about it.","Lawyer.

It wasn't the companies fault. And their insurance will argue it isn't covered because the ride had ended.

You need a personal injury lawyer to go after the driver. Yeah, unfortunately Lyfts insurance doesn't cover anything while there is no passenger in the car anyway, so you'll have to go after the driver and their personal insurance. Contacting Lyft won't really help.

Best course of action is probably to get your own lawyer, but you should post on r/legaladvice and see what they think. I've watched the video about a dozen times. Is your friend made out of glass or something? Other than being startled for a few moments and maybe a scrape or two on the arm or leg, I just can't see how what the driver did would result in serious medical bills. It costs maybe at most $200 to see a primary care physician out of pocket. Am sure Lyft is investigating while they deactivated the driver, but they can't tell you action they take against driver for privacy or legal reasons Medical bills piling up? She sprain an ankle? I guess with American health care it makes sense. Anyways you can guarantee that driver has been fired, no company would want someone that terrible at driving working for them. Obviously get an attorney and sue the driver, Lyft isn't responsible. physical therapy for a scraped knee? maybe she should get a free 5 bucks but come on.  that's the weakest hit ive ever seen and she's trying to scam lyft Can you file and sue in civil court. State by state different , but you can inOA sue for up to 10k.  Also you just needed to file with insurance company I’d driver.  Plus most attorneys who specialize in personal injury and receive  33% of final settlement take cases with no money upfront.  At he too late. Wow quit enabling a scam artist. Or did she promise you a cut?"
This is just robbery,54,49.52985986494356,Lyft,"The pay cuts are just insane... I went to pick someone up and they wanted me to drive 42 minutes away and I politely told them it's not worth it so sorry but no.  Why was it not worth it?

Per minute=$0.1575×42=$6.6
Per mile=$0.225×32=$7.2
7.2+6.6=$13.8

So lyft wanted me to drive 42 minutes to make (let's round up) $14 then I would of had to drive over 1h just to get back to my house so all together 1h 42 minutes or more to make $14... ya no way in hell","Sounds like where ever you live Lyft isn't paying enough in general, shouldn't matter the time. 45 minute drives for me net me $25 - $30 $0.225 a mile?

Dude. Screw them. Stop driving for them. I think you might be actually retarded if you continue to drive for them at that rate.

Edit: The people downvoting me are even stupider than OP for continuing to drive at $0.22 a mile. I want you all to think here for a minute. The IRS recommended employer reimbursement rate is $0.58 a mile. Most car expenses come out to $0.15-$0.20 a mile.

You are not making any money at $0.22 per mile. 

You are an actual idiot if you continue to drive at that abysmal rate, and I don't feel bad for saying that. ive been out of the game now for a couple years but when rates dropped to $2 a ride, i almost had to declare bankruptcy doing Lyft Express. On a good night trying to get all my rides for car rental compensation, i would do 4-5 rides an hour for $8-10 dollars x 8 hours. It was beyond stupid, not mention that i hadnt paid for gas or set aside money for taxes. Lyft is a mathematical genius when it comes to money.  They are hoping drivers are bad at math.  Those who continue to drive at these rates are mathematically dumb.  Sorry to say that, but you all need to hear the truth. Get in contact with your state public utilities commission, and your legislators. Lyft and Uber prey on drivers because of the non-existent legislation. If you guys keep silent, your representatives won't know that you need help or how to help. Lyft is doing hit and run on drivers pockets. not sure what market you're in but here in the Bay if you drive 42 minutes away that's a ~$30 ride. I am quitting also. AAA says cost to operate our car is 40-75 cents per mile. My area is not population dense and each trip costs me $2-$4 just to get to the pick-up point. End up making $5 an hour when the math is done properly. I'm better off delivering scripts for local drugstore with their car and I will make more 4 times as much (that includes tips). Lyft and Uber is certainly not practical in all areas; and surly not in my area. >	so all together 1h 42 minutes or more to make $14... ya no way in hell

It's worse than you say. Drivers need to stop thinking just in terms of dollars per hour. You need to start accounting for your costs of operating your vehicle. If you have a really realiable, fuel efficient vehicle, that doesn't depreciate much, in the best case scenario your paying about $0.30/mile just to operate your vehicle after accounting for depreciation, gas, and maintenance. 

Assuming you didn't have to deadhead back at all, you are spending almost $10 to operate your vehicle those 32 miles. That leaves you making about $4 on that trip.

I just had a ride I took as a passenger yesterday from a driver driving a BMW 3-series less than 3 years old. That guy is 100% losing money by driving for Lyft. Don't be that guy. $13 to drive someone far away, wowsers bowsers.  This is becoming insanity.  These companies are really raking in the dough while drivers suffer. Wow do they pay so bad? In Seattle is .1875 per minute and us $1.11 per mile ( uber pays little bit more) gas chevron 87 is around 3.09 per galon the cheapest place. And the base rate is us $1.065 How much is the base rate there?
Time + distance + base rate = your pay That’s roughly what I pay for a 3.5 mile, 15-20 minute ride (in what I assume is a pretty strong market) I'd stop driving.. where I live we get 89 cents a mile and 27 cents a minute... where tf do you live making that little driving?! 1. It's would HAVE, not would OF.

2. You really got to the pax, saw how far they were going then kicked them out? Get off the road and quit being an asshole to someone who doesn't give a shit about how much you're getting paid, they just want to go somewhere. Your legislators don't own that company and they have no legal right to tell them what to pay you if you want to be a service. Other people you do what you just did you post and you show us that there's a place that only pays 20 or 30 cents a mile and that you said no and that'll encourage others to follow suit"

Yeah. After all those rate cuts - I'm sure Lyft is looking out for drivers' best interests. [deleted] charging surge price and not paying the driver in Knoxville Tn  just started today I just deactivated my account and will be calling local news stations tomorrow This is probably why Lyft decided to do the rate cuts across the country, so it can take more money from drivers to be able to pay for this thing in California that will happen soon.  So drivers in US and Canada are getting more taken out by Lyft so Lyft can pay the hourly people in California. I didn't get it, but thanks for posting it. I called the number to voice my support for AB5. They run a background check on you and the successful ones will be pass to their experts like selecting juries. You are the lucky one. But if you don't do what they tell you to do there WILL be consequences."

If your not getting at least 2 runs per hour you’re at a loss and are just doing damage to your health and well being. Furthermore sitting at idle with your AC runs is extremely tasking on your engine. You’re literally blowing money out the window.

I usually desperately set my GPS for a Wawa and hope it has a bathroom, but I do not turn off the app because I worry that I will miss a ride. So 90% of the time I get a ping before I reach Wawa so I end up holding it for hours at a time. Nice try! LIFE OVER WORK Then why even accept a ride if the driver is gonna cancel? Theres been many a time where i've signed off and back on again and immediately theres a ping for ride. Luckily i work full time and drive when i'm bored. Sounds like someone's been waiting for a ride too long and wants to clear out the market a bit. Or you could just drive uber

I know it’s not possible for some but if it is, that’s what I would do. The truth is if this is happening to you you’re just in a shit market. In shorter term, don't be stupid, stupid.. Why do drivers cancel when they’re a minute away? Or get a real job."

"I have a Lyft subscription, but all of a sudden ALL my rides are MORE expensive so the discount is basically nullified.",25,51.14751032795343,Lyft,"I have been using the Lyft subscription for about two months, and I use it enough that the discount still helps- I ride to work every day and home from work some days (20+ rides a month). I have noticed in the last month however, my average ride has gone from $7-$8  to between $9 and $12 minimum.
Did they realize I was a regular user and jack up the price to cover the difference? Or is this because they have been losing money and they said they would raise prices earlier this month? I’m spending $200+ a month on Lyft at this point, at the rate I’m going it’s going to be too expensive for me to use it soon. 
What should I do, and do I have other options?
For context, I live in Baltimore city and I would have to leave like 45 minutes earlier for work every day if I wanted to take transit. The bus system here is unreliable and calling a cab would be the same kind of issue because of how much longer it would take to get to work.
Considering switching to Uber but I’ve had such bad luck with getting psychotic drivers and them doing nothing about it, so I’m scared to.","Anecdotally, I’ve found that if you open the Lyft app, ask for a fare quote, then open the Uber app and ask for a fare quote, then go back to Lyft, their price has magically dropped down to match the lower Uber price. 

They both do these crazy game theory moves and then benefit from how hard it is to know for sure they’re playing you. So, yes, they’re probably messing with you. As a driver I took a look at the breakdown of two fares with nearly the same distance and time.  One was a scheduled pickup and the other was a regular request.  The scheduled pickup charged the passenger a higher amount than the other passenger.   Both fares paid out nearly the same to me as the driver.  Maybe something similar happened in your situation, did you switch to using scheduled pickups? Thanks everyone, cancelled my subscription and switched to Uber. I suspected this would happen. Glad I caught it after just a couple weeks instead of months.

I knew it was too good to be true. they IPO’d and desperately trying to make a profit. they *only* way they can do this is charge riders more and pay drivers less. Congratulations, to them you’re a captive user now. Screenshot your upfront fare, send the request, and switch from, then back to your original destination and see how much less captive users should be paying if they were offered pricing tied closer to the per mile/per minute rates of your region. 1. Buy some Lyft gift cards.   
2. Set up a new account.   
3. Use first time promo codes for $20 off.   


Rinse. Lather. Repeat. (don't go from the same address to the same address repeatedly, mix it up so they don't catch on that it's you. I'm sure you will get caught eventually, but there's nothing they can really do except ban you from the service, then just go to Uber). It's because you take the same ride multiple days a week.  They are capitalizing on that and know you rely on rideshare to get work.  I read something on here a while ago that it's a thing, if through their data they can tell that, then they will up there price a few dollars when they can see you have to use their service for something.  Pretty shady IMO, but nothing surprises me with these companies as all they care about is their bottom line these days. I will also probably be seeing if I can carpool with a coworker from now on Do yourself a favor, drop the subscription and look for other ways to travel. What Lyft and Uber are doing is capitalizing on the marginal advantage they have over taxis but the companies are no longer reliable. I'm back on the bus because Lyft isn't worth it for me now. Plus with the bus, I get a bit of exercise walking to stops. Switch to Uber, besides most drivers do both platforms so if they’re a creep on Uber they’ll be a creep in Lyft as well.

I used to have those same fears about Uber passengers but it turn out i was wrong and my Uber rating is higher than the highest I ever had at Lyft. Anytime you have a Lyft “discount” all they do is raise your ride price by that “x amount of discount” for example, if you have $5 ride with a 50% discount, Lyft simply adds $2.50 to your quoted price, so even with their discount you’re still paying the original price. All Lyft discounts are scams. This is a well documented ""feature"" of lyft subscriptions.  You are not the first and wont be the last to fall victim.  Feeling woke yet? I usually open both apps and go back and forth for a couple of minutes.  You will see that they seem to sense you are shopping price and start to lower the quote.  Now that lyft lowered driver pay in some cities, there's no way they will lose money unless they lose the rider. They sell gift cards on eBay and other gift card exchanges. They pop up every so often and you can grab them as a good discount. Easy. Use Uber This is one of the unsavory things we will be reminiscing about when Lyft is dead and locked into eternity as a joke."

How many and which days a week.do you work. I'm looking to see what you make not Net. Before any expenses.  Do you also work both Lyft and other ride shares?

Edit: I will be in the San Antonio area and Tampa Bay Area. 

Edit: Also, I know I asked for pre-net earnings, but I am curious about how you all do on your taxes.","You might include your market because they are drastically different depending on area and population I only do Lyft and I only drive in San Francisco and typically work the evening rush, 2/3pm till ???. Depends how I feel really. 

I'm actually a little random dont really have a set schedule. I filter my rides and usually average about $23/25 an hour. 

Try to aim for $200/250 for the day. On top of my goal I'd want whatever I used to fill up my gas before I entered the city. 

Friday/Sat are my main days pulling long shifts, a lot of times I catch a nice groove which makes me stay until I'm booted from the system.

I average 1200/1500 a week, usually putting in a little over 60h. Running Lyft alone - 3am-noon here, on a monday, might get me $70 gross. Any other day and I'd be lucky to get $40-50. Demand drops to 0 here, 9am-12pm. For 3 hours the ants drive around in circles. It's funny to watch.  


I'm from an over saturated market with around 150,000 people in the area. A lot of people hate Uber here, which is funny to me. 

If I were you, running both apps, I'd set $120 as your goal for that time frame -- but expect half of that until you start figuring out the area. I did extensive market research in my area before coming to the conclusion that to make $20-$30 an hour I had to drive Friday and Saturday nights from 8pm to 8am. (Sunday days can also be good, but obviously, I can't drive Sunday days if I've been awake and driving the 12 hours prior).   


The only other decent-ish driving times are 4am-noon on weekdays, but I find once you get past 9am things really grind to a halt.   


So I can drive around aimlessly and just lower my per hour average until it becomes minimum wage or less OR... I can drive only during peak times and actually make somewhat decent money.   


This is the Las Vegas, Nevada market so it is unique."
Lyft has been fucking passengers as well,13,51.71678116130608,Lyft,I've noticed the Lyft rate has been randomly doubling on the passenger end.  $20 ride 5 miles away from the airport cost 1 passenger over $40. Of course the driver only got nine of this. I tried setting up a ride to the transit center which is normally $10 and it ranged anywhere from 10 to 22 and it would change every couple of minutes. App claimed that the area was busy although there were more than 8 drivers within 4 miles of pickup location. I've been recommending all my lyft users switch to Uber at least until they start doing the same thing.,"Three rides made me not wanna drive again.

1. Pax paid $14.30 for a ten min ride. I got $4.16 while lyft for $10.14.

2. Pax paid $10.80 for a 5 min ride. I got $3 dollars. Lyft got $7.80.

3. Pax paid $9.40 for a 7 min ride. I got $4.09 while lyft got $5.31. 

The house always wins! Those are consecutive rides last Saturday and the reason im noping the fuck out of ride sharing. LUL, I paid 56$ to go somewhere once and I texted the driver afterwards and asked what he got since we had a nice chat in the car and I said I wanted to know what they paid him. Dude said he got 11$.

Do I have to notify insurance, good 💡, a must ??!!

How much can I make part time?","Your personal insurance provider may drop you.  Alternatively, your insurance provider may offer to charge you additional money for a type of gap insurance that will cover if uber/lyft insurance comes up short. Don’t do it.....you’ll always regret it. I did a lot of driving around Long Beach when I started out. It’s a good area but lots of short rides. If you really want to make money you have to be good at figuring out the best areas and times to drive. Most of my long rides would end up in dead or lame areas of the OC. 

It’s also quite saturated in LB and I found going out to areas around LA are much better, longer rides and higher demand. Downtown is only 25 minutes away if there’s no traffic and from there you can be all over the LA area. Yes you need to notify your insurance.  Not all insurance agencies carrier rideshare endorsements, so if your agency doesn't carry it, you're going to have to switch insurance.  In CA, only All State, State Farm, Mercury and USAA (military/vets only) carry it.  Mine is $10/month more, so totally worth it.  This endorsement covers period 1.  You can then use Uber/Lyft insurance for periods 2/3.  If you don't tell your agency and they find out, there's a good chance they drop your policy, then you have to find another carrier and it'll be more expensive because you'll have a ding on your record.

Old lady made me her bitch. Now I feel victimized.,31,52.41160755024188,Lyft,"  
Had the DF on and was about 20 miles from my house when I got a ping from Walmart. I hoped it was just an employee going home who was going to get me much closer to my house.    


Nope. It was an old lady, probably in her late 70s, in a wheelchair, with a fucking stinky dog, and a shit load of groceries -- which she didn't want in the trunk because the trunk was for the wheelchair only. And of course, it was a Shared ride.   


So the wheelchair took the trunk space, the groceries and the dog took the entire back seat, and I had to help her jump in the front seat, where she proceeded to curse me out for taking too long to get there, not being careful enough with her groceries, and not knowing what the fuck she was talking about when she asked me which promo code to use.   


I am very assertive with my passengers, and that has helped me avoid trouble. But this lady overwhelmed me from the beginning. My first instinct was to cancel and bolt out of there, but I feared any potential accusations because she had a dog and was in a wheelchair. I was in a no win situation.   


It was a 3 mile ride, $4.83 total, and the most stressful 15 minutes I've had in a very long time.  And my only recourse is rating the bitch 1 star and whining about it online, because Lyft doesn't give a shit about drivers.","She can't have a shit ton of groceries, a dog *and* a wheelchair on a shared ride - there needs to be room for 4 PAX period. Next time say ""no, sorry - you need to order a regular ride.""

>Conduct in a Shared ride

Because there's the high probability of sharing a Shared ride with another party or two, we ask that you be considerate toward other riders. This includes leaving any pets at home (excluding service animals) and not taking up too much space with luggage or baggage.

We want the experience to be fun, pleasant, and safe for everyone, so be mindful of your language and conduct. We also suggest that if you're traveling with a small child in a carseat or have a large group that you request a standard Lyft or Lyft XL. Take a photo of the groceries and wheelchair.  Take screenshot showing it was shared.  They then can't touch you for cancelling. Had a number of these. Some folks like her know how to play the system and fit inbetween the cracks. Good news is now you can see it and say nope,sorry. What happens if during her shared ride you are routed to another pax and that pax doesn't want to ride with a ""dog""?  Total fubar situation. Shared rides have restrictions. I will never experience this since I do not accept shared rides. Yeah, take a picture of the groceries, woman, wheelchair, dog (clearly not a helper dog I hope) and wait for 5 minutes to be up and drive off. If she asks, say shared rides are one person and whatever they can carry on their lap, the dog isn't allowed unless an ADA qualified pet. What happens if you have to pick up two more people, and you can't even fit one more in the back? $5 and drive away with your picture for insurance. > I'm sorry, I can't take you on a shared ride if you and your stuff are going to take more than one seat. If Lyft assigns other riders, where will they sit? If you cancel this ride and book a regular Lyft, it should get routed to me as I'm the closest to you, and then we can get going. Lyft should automatically waive the cancellation fee, but if not, you can contact support and they'll do it.

If she refuses to cancel, take photos of the situation and tell her that you have to take photos before it'll let you cancel, then you cancel and 1-star the shit out of her. Then, immediately open up support and give them an account of what happened and request a cancellation fee. I hate pings from markets . And a share ride ? Even more Let me guess. You had to carry this bitch's groceries to her door too.

Fuck that noise. I would have ended the ride the moment she cussed you and reported her verbal abuse to Lyft. this woman had to have had a shit rating before you accepted the ride. **Never pick up from a Walmart**. And I say this as someone who shops at Walmart 2-3× a week. Just have experienced too many bad PAX at different WM stores. Yeah. I have a wheelchair and sometimes bring my pet dog, but I always call asap and ask the driver if I may bring a small, well behaved, dog with me. Also, I would never get a shared ride but I'm sure she did it because it was the cheapest option. Sorry you had to deal with that. I always try to give drivers a good impression of pax in wheelchairs. I feel like you shouldn't have to give a reason for cancelling the ride when you show up to a situation like that. I'd rather lose 5 bucks and cancel myself in order to avoid that kind of incident. F Guess you shouldn’t let old lady make you cry victim."

As you can see with my tip to ride. Wow I barely get tipped. I used to give water, gum, candy. But in the area I work in mostly which is Union and Essex county in NJ (aka Newark mostly) people suck. They are cheap for the most part, and also take advantage . I used to have some take stacks of stuff at times. I said nope, I'll just take people from point A to B and be nice and respectful and have a nice convo if possible. In other words, the over the top service wasn't bringing in enough tips for me.

Do they really expect someone to do these kinds of rides? Seriously 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️,26,52.74884134655198,Lyft,Image,"Once I was curious about who will hold a ride deep inside the mountains. So I drove and drove there. It was like a hidden restaurant. The pax are a family who fly overseas to attend a wedding. It was very strange that nobody arranged or offer them a ride.

Is that to pick them up or drop them off? More content would be nice. I did a super long pickup on uber the other day and the pax got charged a long pickup fee for it, ended up getting $30 for what would normally be a ~$10 ride. I kinda can't believe Lyft doesn't do this as well, only way to make a long pickup worth it. Why did you accept it? The other night I accepted a ride before I realized they were 20 minutes away from me. Ended up being a fucking no-show, called them twice to be sure but got no answer. $5 cancelation fee certainly didn't cover the gas and time I wasted. Fuck that guy. Looks to me like you're doing it... What “kind” of ride are you talking about?"
Am I understanding this correctly?,17,52.96436217989635,Lyft,"The new TOS state:

>**Damage Fee**. If a Driver reports that you have materially damaged the Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a “Damage Fee” of up to $250 depending on the extent of the damage (as determined by Lyft in its sole discretion), towards vehicle repair or cleaning. Lyft reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior to processing the Damage Fee. ([source](https://www.lyft.com/terms/preview))

This sounds like a passenger could be charged $250 without any evidence that they caused the damage, much less that the damage even exists. Am I misunderstanding the TOS? Or is this my punishment for reading them?","If you poke around on this sub, you'll see it's been getting much harder to driver's to claim damage and cleaning fees. If anything, Lyft is trying to keep drivers from collecting damage payments because each one represents a pissed off customer that isn't likely to return to the platform.

Don't worry, they're not coming after you. Lyft doesn't make any money off damage fees, it just gets passed on to the driver. It's not a profit center, Lyft doesn't care. They can go ahead and charge you before documenting the evidence. However, to protect against the chargeback, they’re gonna have to have evidence. All this is saying is that they don’t have to gather the evidence before charging you, nor do they have to “enclose” evidence to you $250 isn't much when it comes to car damage. Rider dents the car and it could easily cost more.  Don't like them capping it at $250. It's purposefully ambiguous, as are many legal statements, so that they can do what is best for the company per scenario Before funds are paid out we have to supply evidence of damage and a estimate. 

After funds are paid out we must provide a receipt. I had to provide very detailed pics of damage for the one claim I've made. I feel that Lyft assessed it somewhat fairly, if anything I feel like they gave the pax a bit of a break on the damage fee. She puked all over my back seat, door, and the back of the seat in front of her, and they charged her an extra $100. Took me 3 hours to clean up"

Developing driverless cars is a total uber move, and these rates now reflect Uber's. We need to make a new company that 1. Won't ever develop or purchase driverless cars. 2. Won't ever change from a starting percentage of 80% driver, 20% company of a fare. 3. Won't ever charge any ""rider"" or ""safe rider fees"" (by not doing so such a company would be able to remain competitive with the others. 4. Company would never go public, never have an IPO. 5. People always come before profits, share holders will always be the companies last priority, never before people, or doing the right thing. 6. Insert other ideas I have if you wanna help me start this, though anyone is welcome to take this and run with it. People>profits. Look at Uber ASAP man And I...oop I saw .24 cents a mile somewhere on reddit today on this new change. Wanna say it was Phoenix? I had a newish driver come up to me yesterday asking why he hadn’t received his new driver sign on bonus of 1950.  I took a look at his phone and explained to him it wasn’t 1950 additional for 220 rides.  But it was guaranteed earnings of 1950 over the course of those 220 rides. I think mine was 600 or so. “CANCELLATION NOTICE!! ....We notice that you are cancelling a lot.” Assh0les. If they still have this frame of mind what good can we expect? Lyft manipulates drivers for profit. Lyft sucks so bad. I am only doing Uber these days."
Why did my Lyft driver do this to me?,25,53.75598255030259,Lyft,"I just sat and waited outside of my house for my Lyft driver. I recognized the dude's name and car too, I've given him big tips and perfect scores. It said he was 2 min away but it took 7 minutes for him to show. Not a big deal but maybe it's an important detail. 
  
Driver arrived, windows down and pulled up in front of my house. We looked at each other and I smiled at him and got up, leaning over to stuff my phone charger cord into my bag. He slowly started to roll away. 
  
I ran up to the door with my bag, ""hey, I'm right here"". He sped up down my street. 
  
I was shocked. I started running with my bags yelling ""Hey wait!  Please wait!  I'm your ride!!""

He turned the corner and sped off, hitting cancel. 

Why would he do this?
Does he think I'm someone else?  Does I think I reviewed him poorly before and didn't think it was me until he pulled up next to me?
  
I'm astonished.","probly just wanted the 5 dollar cancellation fee since it’s more than he was gonna make on that ride lol As far as why it took 7 minutes to get to you when it said 2: Lyft is dumb. It doesn’t keep track of road closures or construction or general traffic. One time in the middle of rush hour the Lyft app was telling me my ETA to a passenger was 9 minutes while my GPS said 26. Some drivers do dick around and hope you’ll cancel so they get free money, but most of the time it’s just Lyft not knowing what it’s doing. Time to arrive is BS. When I was a rider I always noticed the app lying to get ride requests.

As for why the driver pulled off maybe he just had to go to the bathroom. Cant always assume something bad.  That’s common because Lyft shows us where you are going when we arrive, it’s most likely to do with your destination . > I started running with my bags...

Were you going to the airport?  Some drivers either don't have the certificate to go there or they don't want to - another possibility is that he didn't want to go to your destination *which he can't see until he arrives* because he wanted to go home, in the opposite direction. Were you covered in blood and holding a chainsaw by chance? ""Why did my Lyft driver do this to me?"" 

Im sorry the driver did this to you.  Especially sad as you are clearly a good passenger with good rider etiquette. 

To answer your question - Lyft takes 50% of what you are paying to the driver if it's a ""short"" ride (less than 10 mi.).  With Lyft especially, drivers are being paid so little...very few are able to make a living accepting short rides. 

It's not personal.  Ride hailing is dead and with the only drivers left: your mileage may vary. Who cares, just order another 1 and wait 4 mins. Need more information. Distance of trip, was it to the ghetto, are you in the ghetto, etc. You likely just look shady af Complain to Lyft. That's not OK."
"Oh for Love of all that is holy and unholy, Minneapolis pax please don't request Lyft between Lake and 31st in Uptown on Hennepin.",5,53.910635328088645,Lyft,"That is a freaking bike and car only lanes, I can't stop and back up single lane traffic, I just cancelled Ruben via Lyft for this exact Mofo reason.","But my last driver ignored traffic laws. We has the same problem in San Francisco with Market Street. Lyft's HQ is less than a mile from Market and Uber's is on Market. In the last several months there's been a drastic reduction in pick ups on this stretch of road. I'm guessing SF came down on them. If you have the time and inclination, lobby your local government to do the same.

When I pickup people from out of town I give a friendly talk about not putting pick up or drop off locations on Market, walk a block away from busy areas and look for the white curbs that denote passenger loading zones. Just hit arrive as you approach the pickup location, then keep circling around and no-show him."
Saw a post about fair rate being ~ $1/mile. How can I get Lyft to increase this rate because I feel it’s DRASTICALLY low,45,54.19527653180338,Lyft,Image,"Quit.  You Will never make money at 30 cents a mile.  That ought to be illegal.  It's a joke. $13 for a 35 minute 24 mile ride? Cmon Lyft Get more drivers to quit in your market. Now that's some bullshit.   


I did a 30 min, 15 mile trip the other day and made about $15. Checked again to be sure. I'd certainly be losing money at those rates. I've got a 5.7 Hemi. She drinks more than the local bar hoppers. Holy sweet Jesus! They are getting away with robbery indeed, I understand markets and stuff but this is like minimum wage after expenses, how much did Lyft take on their end? This is the first weekend for this new pay structure in Las Vegas. Express Drivers are getting .24 cents a mile there. Yet, per a discussion on a FB group, there are no shortage of drivers. If drivers don't quit en masse in larger cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix, Lyft will get away with this nationwide. This mileage rate would only make sense if your time were like $0.45+ per minute. This is ridiculous. $0.30/mi is robbery. Ditch Lyft. If Uber has better rates, don't do Lyft ever again. Where is this? This is insane!  How is this profitable? That’s a 29$ ride for me where I drive. If they restructure rate card i wouldn’t drive anymore. This is insane.  They just want new drivers who don’t know better. They will be rolling this out nationwide.  RDU was one of the initial markets on 8-14 and there is another group on 8-24 per another post here earlier today.  I have stoped taking Lyft requests all together now.  They adjusted XL and LUX rates as well.

No primetime, no PPZ, and now this bullshit...if they want to eliminate their driver base in our market, then it’s working cause I am done with them. I have my weekly goal set to $1. I rarely hit it. I hope it sends a messahe to Lyft. I'm almost entirely on Uber. You’re never gonna change it. 

It’s a scam and you shouldn’t rely on it for primary income. That's pretty bad.  No longer trading depreciation on car.  Your basically paying them to drive. Damn Lyft. That's cheap. Bending you over and giving it to you nice and hard without the lube. Smdh. 24 miles. That's more than $13 for half of the ride Think they’re about to do that in the Nashville market. Gouge the per minute/mile while adding the few pennies for travel time It's not worth it and it hasn't been for a long time.  You'd get higher income getting an entry level job.  I'd get out now.  The correct path is to increase your income.  Lyft or Uber will do the opposite for you.  They are getting away with paying less than minimum wage. That’s ridiculous. The 13¢ a minute is what gets me. Traffic is horrible and you get paid pennies for it. Those rates are atrocious. Quit. That crap isn't worth it. What market is this Just more reasons as to why lyft will use this to justify automated cars. somehow the drivers are going to be looked at as greedy at the end of all this. Damn they reduced your ass to $7 for a 25 mile ride? Taxis are really laughing now. $27/hr isn’t bad."
Coming soon to the Phoenix area: prepare yourself,46,54.528864494766346,Lyft,Image,"“Value your time”

Lyft - slavery for the 21st century. Jesus Christ. That’s slave wage What in the *actual* ***fuck***? I can't believe this shit. Holy shit that’s worse than Vegas! Lol wtf And also, ain’t no way in HELL youre driving 30 miles in LA in an hour. I assume Phoenix being a big city is not very different. And the per mile is only from pickup to destination, not going to or finding your next ride. So a conservative estimate would probably be 8-10 miles. So at 8 miles (which again is only what you’re driving from pickup to drop off not anything in between and accounting for traffic) you’re making a whole 1.8$ 😂🤣🤣😂. That doesn’t even cover gas. Much less insurance and depreciation. That eats from your “per-minute”. Which you estimated as 9$ in near perfect condition. Which is most likely half that. So 4.5$. Then minus insurance and depreciation. You might be profiting 3-4$/hr when it’s said and done. GOOD LUCK PAYING RENT WITH THAT 😂😂😂😤. But then again maybe your president Trump can revive a “great” industry like coal again for you to go slave away at a garbage salary. 🎤⬇️ Lyft also was dishonest on their quarterly earnings call saying they were “optimistic” and actually withheld total number of bookings from investors and seek profitably “within three years”. 

They managed to manipulate their own stock that day by 6% even though the company is in flames. Potential SEC violation right there. 

Again, this company will be insolvent within 36 months at best. Nope. Just a lyft driver that cares about multi billion dollar companies following labor laws. They have for quite sometime bent and molded their interpretation of how we drivers can be considered “contractors” though we function completely and only within the scope of their business. This has led to a gradual slash of rates because “fuck it we can, they’re not employees”. There used to be a time where driving rideshare was decent money. 20-25$/hr that is. Now it’s become literally less than federal minimum wage like markets in Phoenix. Either these multi billion dollar companies play by the labor laws that govern all business and pay their soon to be known as “employees” a decent fair wage, or... like you said the phase out humans and go all automated. I wouldn’t be pissed off if that happened. I would understand it to be a smart business decision. But until then, if humans are working for you, abide by the fucking labor laws. Oof. That's rough as hell. The problem is that lots of people will still drive. It'll push out veteran drivers who will move onto something else, but new people will sign up still to chase the money. THis is express drive? If I still drove for Lyft, and this came to my market, I'd drive VERY slowly to the passenger once I accepted a ride. Especially if they sent those wild 15-minute-away requests they are known for doing. 10 miles $2.25 8 mins pick up and with 3 min wait time and 17 min ride $4.41= $6.66.   
Old rates 10 miles $6.00 8 min pick no pay. 3 min wait 12.75 cents. 17 min drive time. 20 mins $2.54 =$8.54  so they lowered the driver pay again lmao. I’ll just leave this here too. Either use humans fairly or invest in self driving cars.

I Got Bonus Scammed by Lyft,1,54.530253383655236,Lyft,"So I sat in a pink zone for 15 minutes and finally earned the max bonus of 6.55$. After that I found it odd that I couldn’t find a ride so I started driving around. Took a weirdly long time to find a ride being at downtown LA on a Friday. Finally I got one. Pax got in my car and I hit “pick up”. The ride instantly gets cancelled saying I cancelled it. Guess what? I get no bonus. I contacted lyft and they say I cancelled (which I didn’t, why would I with max bonus?). Anyone had this happen before? I feel scammed.","I had a similar issue with this Friday.
Ultimately this feels too much like a freaking game and has me staring at my screen too much when I should just drive."

"Found a small market in Indiana that pays the rates we are all asking for. The customer didn’t complain about price or anything. He just commented that he was happy I was in the area so that he could get to work. Higher, fairer rates can work for both parties.",29,54.752903846632,Lyft,Image,"FYI, Seattle is $1.11/mi and $0.18/min.  Our city council told the rideshare companies they had to be close to our $15/hr min wage or else face regulations.  So they haven't dropped us any lower.

I made $213 in 6 hours on Uber this week so far.  That's $35/hr.  $137 in 5 hours on Lyft at $27/hr.

Those numbers are wildly inaccurate when you factor in how often I'm online in both apps, but it's an extremely awful day if don't get $20-25/hr including travel time home.  Some days are $35/hr or a bit higher if I get lucky with long rides. Holy shit. I had no idea i could change rate location. Northern Maine is a lot more lucrative for the drivers compared to southern.

So if we drive into that region the rate cards change automatically or do we need to let lyft know we want to drive in a different market? small markets lack demand, lack of demand creates lack of drivers, lack of drivers drive rates up. Look up any podunk town in your state and you'll probably see rates like $1.50/mi. Now check how many drivers are online, maybe 1. May I ask where in Indiana this was at? Lake Havasu City is $1.80 per mile. Just sayin Town here in Indiana is around 72 cents/mile. I'm guessing we'll get hit with a 20% cut soon enough.

Saw my first 25% prime time bonus pop up today. It was gone in about 30 seconds. Long enough for me to take a screen shot. Happy days. You consider that good? Driving 5 miles for 8$? Wow. Mine is 30 cents a mile In Durham NC. Just posted a separate pic. Smh sucks really. City’s not even big And, it's gone. This has to be Bloomington Meh, I'll still take my current rates over yours OP - .728/mile .312/minute 1.76 base"
Uber and Lyft finally admit they’re making traffic congestion worse in cities,2,54.76116773553193,Lyft,Image,"(I) tl;dr. It's not that uber/lyft make traffic worse. It's that:

1) Even in downtown/busy areas lyft/uber still force drivers to wait on passengers. Cancellation fees should occur in 30 seconds max.

2) In busy/downtown areas a lot of roadsides are marked as taxi only. So drivers can't pull over there without getting a ticket. This has nothing to do with lyft/uber.

3) Drivers stupidly turn on hazards and wait for passengers blocking the entire lane. Not cool.

4) **And this is the big one.** Uber/lyft have an overabundance of drivers on the road. Taxi's are limited to 250 or so in the city. Uber alone has over 15,000 active drivers just in the Seattle area. And while you can blame uber/lyft for this the fact of the matter is the city should be regulating how many TNC drivers are on the road and that's the cities failure.

We've already covered neither one of these companies cares for their drivers and just cares about their end profit so they really should be more regulated then they currently are."
Does this seem fair to you?,15,54.90683903182822,Lyft,Image,"Not a bit. Can anyone explain this when Lyft claims to only take 25% of the fare. What do they actually mean by that 25% number and how does it apply in this instance? I had a gem last night. The lady paid $14.30 for a 10 minute ride. Lyft took $10.15 of the fare while i took $4.16. 

I almost stopped but continued to see what the next ride would be

2nd pax paid $10.80 for a 4 min ride. Lyft got $7.80 and i got $3.

Surely this is a joke. So i did one more.

3rd pax paid $9.40 for a 7 min ride. Lyft took $5.31 and i got $4.09.

That is a total of 21 + minutes of driving where i only got $11.25 but lyft got $23.26.

They took away prime time for drivers but they are still giving prime time rates to pax while giving us base fare.

Im officially done. Well, Lyft did say that:

1. They're not operating on a sustainable business model
2. They will be taking more from the drivers

First time they've been transparent. Lyft gives 0 fucks about you - only the 60%+ they can leech off your work for free. Lyft thinks it's fair! This looks like an airport ride; as Lyft has to pay the airport fees. Can the poster clarify the route? But look at your average. It's not like you're earning lesser rates, they are just charging more on some rides.

But, look at [this](https://imgur.com/a/2q2Dsvz), is this more fair? Of course not, but in the end it all averages out."
Lyft just updated their Terms of Service. Bend over boys and girls.,3,54.923621439246666,Lyft,It's about to get uglier.

Queue and app crash issues. Has this ever happened to you?,3,54.92630662443185,Lyft,"Just curious if this has happened to anyone else. Its a real problem I think Lyft should look into. Today I picked up a pax. As im driving to drop pax off I get someone added to my queue. Fine. No problem. Business as usual. Immediately after I drop off my pax the app goes crazy on me on me. Wont even let me hit the drop off passenger prompt. I Wound up having to restart my phone to get the thing to work again. As soon as I re- launch the app I come up as having no passenger and no one in my queue. Then all of a sudden someone is added to my queue. Which shouldnt even happen at this point. Anyway, I assume it must be the same pax that was in my queue when the app crashed. I really have no idea because I never check people in my queue until I drop off my pax or can safely check phone. So I go and pick up the pax and drop them off. Again, no problem. I then log out to take a bathroom break. All of a sudden my phone is blowing up coming from the 415 area code. Im logged out so im not answering it. Figure let it go to voicemail. This person called me five times in a row and never left a message. Im almost positive that it was probably the pax who was in my queue when the app crashed. And for whatever reason the pax wasnt automatically canceled from me, or at the very least moved to another drivers queue! This same scenario has happened to me before. The pax is basically waiting for me (or whoever) to show up but we never will. Because due to the app crash they are no longer in our queue. They are in Lyft oblivion. I had a guy leave me a message pissed as Hell saying ""Where the F are you??"". And I dont blame him for being mad. I tried calling Lyft but it seems that short of being taken hostage by Somali pirates there is no longer a direct number for drivers to phone them! Its all email. Im concerned now that this guy could ruin my ratings even though I never picked him up!","What type of phone? If Android, what build / version? How's your cell reception there?  


I had a good number of problems with the queue system this last week. I'd be sitting there, chilling in a parking lot, unaware that a ride in the queue had fired off. No sound or notifications. One of those ""Oh... I guess I'm supposed to be picking someone up?"" things. I have noticed, however, that cell reception is to blame for some of my problems. My phone at times might display full bars, but speed / latency / data tests sometimes result in 2G or similar coverage. In fact, I've manually switched a good number of times from 4G LTE to 3G as latency and speeds actually increase for me out here.

Did you really think they were going to give you $1000 above what you earned on the rides? Obviously a sign on bonus and a guarantee are two different things.  I guess fine print covers their intentional misleading ass.  Anytime I have worked for a company that had to sell you on taking the job it only got worse. Lyft sucks balls.

Homie is lucky driver wasn't CCW. Weird. YouTube search: 

A rideshare drivers worst nightmare caught on camera. If I ever hear “drive off your on the wrong block” im getting outta there ASAP Dude literally warned him at like 1:25ish. 

""Drive on, you on the wrong block, drive on.""

That doesn't mean ""You're in the wrong spot for the person you're looking for."", it means ""You're the wrong kind of person to be in this neighborhood, for your safety I think you should leave."" Dude. You handled that like a champ.  👍 so scary. A few months ago I had someone I picked up in a bad part of town ask how much cash I had on me about halfway through the ride. I pulled over and asked him to get out of my car. He claimed he had a gun, but never showed me. He eventually got out a took off running.  I was a little shaken up but went right home after. I get a little pissed at Uber and Lyft over their 'acceptance rating' bullshit though....now, I purposefully will not pick up in that area of town anymore. Screw my rating. That's why I think drivers should carry a gun for their defense. Don't get me wrong but it's one of those situations. Personally, I wouldn't stand there any longer, I would start to drive with door open and jiggle my whole car from left to right until he falls out of my car. Fuck my car, it's just a thing, life isn't. Wow, I've been following this story from when it happened as I also drive in Lancaster (at night). Posted about it last week: https://www.reddit.com/r/lyftdrivers/comments/cmf2vs/be_careful_out_there_and_get_a_dashcam_if_you_can/ First of all, thank goodness the driver made it out ok. When adrenaline is pumping and there's a gun pointed at you, it's very hard to know what is best way to react. And most importantly, I am NOT victim blaming and I feel nothing but sympathy for this innocent driver. There but the grace of God go I...

With that said, there are a few lessons I take from this incident. First, I couldn't quite make out what was said during that first interaction the driver had with someone outside the car, but if I hear someone say "" You need to move along"" I should move along. It seems like a warning that, at the very least, unfriendly folks are around. Second, when it became clear that that you want the guy out of your car, and he seems offended that you said ""Get the f*** out of my car"" it is time to descalate, apologize, say what they want to hear so they can leave. 

Most importantly imo, accelerating away when the guy is still in the car is a surefire way to piss them off. Of course, if the person is halfway out of the car, perhaps it's the best thing to do so you can safely GTFO, but you have to make sure speeding away gets you further away from the threat and not trap you in a vulnerable place with a pissed off criminal.

Perhaps he should have emptied his wallet when the rider commanded him, but I'm just not sure one way or the other. I feel like there might be good arguments for either course of action. 

I hope this scumbag gets arrested somehow, someway. He had ample warnings and time to leave . Really risking your life for a few bucks? Moronic. Not saying the gang bangers are in the clear but goddamn how dense can you be... Dude? Fuck this scum should have shot that gang rat in the face this is why I carry Guess it didn't go viral...

You're trying to tell me that if I have an airport ride and take 470 to boulder for example..they are charging the passenger for the toll (which they have always done) and not reimbursing the driver? Lyft probably made a mistake. Happens sometimes. Contact support and you’ll get your money. Haha laughs in Orlando .53 a mile $20 an hour. Not bad. Stay with it! Or learn a skill? K bye Uber is definitely 100x better."
"Hmm... I wonder why no California cities are on this list? But drivers in these other major markets should prepare for pay cuts -- or what Lyft calls ""improvements.""",34,55.76411912447877,Lyft,Image,"So it looks like [Lyft has quietly announced](https://thehub.lyft.com/?offset=1562721049725) that they are bringing the ""Start Earning as Soon as You Tap Accept"" pay structure to more cities this summer! They have already rolled out these ~~pay cuts~~ ""improvements"" to other markets, including Las Vegas and Raleigh.

EDIT: I'm not in support of the effort of some to rid rideshare drivers of their independent contractor status. But I do find it funny that Lyft has ignored California when it comes to rolling out this new pay structure because they know this is a pay cut, no matter how much they try to dress it up.  They don't want to add fuel to the fire by bringing this pile of shit to California just yet. This ever comes to Denver I plan to quit by accepting and then starting my errands, maybe I'll pick someone up eventually. Las Vegas - 45 cents pickup 24 cents per mile. Literally fucking embarrassing. Express drivers make less.  It’s basically robbery Wait, why is this a pay cut? California is one of their biggest markets. It wouldn't make for them to cut fares. Where is this graphic from? If your market is not on this list, I wouldn't claim victory yet. From what I've read this will be Lyft's new pay structure nationwide by the end of the year. Communist Lyft at their best.

I need to contact a driver that I had to cancel the ride with,15,56.03093625410839,Lyft,"My girlfriend got a Lyft to work and when she got in the car the app wasn’t working so she had to cancel the ride and get another Lyft but she left her purse in the cancelled Lyft car and we don’t know how to contact them.

Any advice would be appreciated. She’s pregnant and her medication is in her purse.","Contact Lyft's ""critical safety line"" since it involves medication. It should be in the “trip history” menu of the app."
Just had a weird driver and don’t know if I should tell lyft?,23,56.43828579115923,Lyft,"Sorry if this isn’t allowed.

I work late at night (till 3 am) and lyft home. I never had a problem until tonight.... my driver was really odd.

I go to my house and when I turn around to shut the door, I see my lyft driver out of his car doing what looks like him taking pictures of my house.

I freaked out and quickly closed the door and rewatched my security camera.

He got out of his car. Went and opened the back seat where I was. And then stood there with his phone horizontal pointed at me as I was unlocking my door.

The guy has 5 stars and I don’t want to get him into trouble if what I saw was actually really innocent.

What do y’all think??

Also I’m 21/F and 100 lbs so I am kinda spooked rn ngl.","He was probably stretching and playing a game. Gotta catch em all. maybe he has been burned by PAX stating he took wrong PAX on trip and lost his fare , and he is just protecting himself? I find that more likely. Why not ask the driver WTF are you doing? He took a picture of your house?! Hell, yeah, get him fired!

&#x200B;

For real, though, creepy and insensitive for sure. Evil and malicious? No idea. Dude yes. That’s creepy as all hell. His rating really doesn’t mean anything - it’s the average of the last 100 rides he gave, but if someone doesn’t rate him he gets 5 stars for that ride by default. So he could be creeping out a bunch of people but if they just ignore it and don’t rate him at all, nothing happens. Always report your concerns. If what he was doing was innocent, he won’t be in trouble. Maybe he and his wife are discussing painting their house, and he liked the color of your place and wanted to send photos to her.  Or your landscaping. Or your roof. Who knows?(The polite thing to do would be to ask, but sometimes people aren’t thinking.) Whatever the reason, Lyft won’t know if you don’t tell them, and if it is something creepy, he needs to be stopped. Always err on the side of keeping Lyft in the loop. The checking the back seat thing is pretty normal. We want to make sure you haven’t left anything, and we want to make sure there’s no trash or anything before the next passenger. 3* unpair. He is either dumb or creepy. Deserve to be reported. Let him explain to Lyft. That’s really odd and creepy. I would definitely report him. That is weird. Sounds like a bit of a creeper, but we’re just not 100% sure. Just keep an eye on your security cam. Next time you request a Lyft and he’s the driver, cancel that ride. I don’t know if what he did is enough to contact Lyft outright about it if you’re worries he might get in trouble. Report the driver and let the driver explain situation to Lyft safety team.  Bad drivers need to be terminated.  There may be other reports on driver and Lyft did not have enough info and or driver made up an excuse so Lyft let driver slide the first or second time. Protect yourself. Heckin A report that for sure. You aren't wrong to even consider a police report. Report him. When I drive a female late at night, sometimes I'll ask if she wants me to stick around until they get inside.  


About half will say ''yes thank you' and sound grateful about it, and the other half will say ""it's okay"", so I move along right away.  


Aside from that, there is ZERO reason why  a driver should not leave the premises of your house immediately, day or night.   


So report him to Lyft. Doing so might even save his life, because at some point he's going to encounter someone not as nice as you."
I need some advice,6,56.4688297726407,Lyft,"I drive in the Express drive program and last week I did not meet my ride minimum (20 rides) due to my father in law passing away and all the family responsibilities that comes with that, on top of my day job. I've heard that sometimes they will let you slide with good cause, but every story I've heard was a documented with Lyft reason (pax puked in car, car broke down etc) I -need- this car to be able to get to my day job, plus I live nearly an hour and a half from the rental hub. I've talked to Lyft support (link to the follow up email at the bottom) and they of course told me to return the vehicle ASAP, but couldn't give me an answer one way or the other on if the hub would let me renew as the final say is with them. They did give me a support ticket number so the Lyft rep at the hub can see the on going case, and told me that the issue had been ""escalated"" to a team that could help. How screwed am I? Should I take the car back tomorrow and risk getting stranded an hour and a half away? Or should I hold on to the car until I can setup a ride home/to work the day I take it back?

http://imgur.com/a/tihjW6E","Regular Lyft support can't do anything about Express Drive stuff. They'll always tell you to return the car, but the decision ultimately belongs to the rental company. I'd call the rental location and explain the situation just so they have a heads up, but you'll have to go one way or the other. I missed the requirement one week because a snow storm was much worse than expected and my car actually wound up being frozen in my driveway. I called and asked, they told me it shouldn't be a problem renewing it but I did need to bring the car in just in case the system said it needed to be swapped out or something. 

I don't think you should hang on to it without at least calling. I don't think they can do anything over the phone, but if you explain what happened and that you're an hour and a half away maybe they can work something out. fwiw, I've missed it twice and not had a problem either time. First when I spent 3 days in the hospital and was still sick when discharged, and then the aforementioned snowstorm. Neither the Lyft nor Hertz employee gave a shit and were fine with it; the only issue was the second time they said it wasn't up to them and it depended on whether the system would let them do it. If this is your first time you're probably fine. It's easier for them to let you keep the car then return it/inspect it/rent it out to someone else/etc. 

Sorry for your loss. Hope you're doing okay. Depends on alot of things. Contact the ED Lyft reps."

Lyft’s auto-accepting BS put me in a very uncomfortable situation.,28,56.657417735622985,Lyft,"I do Uber and Lyft at the same time because you just have to to maximize your profits. That being said, Lyft is a nightmare with its constant notifications about how not taking a ride hurts them yadayada so I usually prefer Uber. 

I get a halfway decent Lyft ride right into the heart of downtown where clubs and bars are letting out. I turn on Uber as I’m approaching the drop off and when I switch back to Lyft I get the notification that a ride has been added. No thanks. I hit decline and immediately log off. It does the whole “are you sure thing?” And I hit yes. 

Drop off Lyft and pick up the Uber passenger a few feet down. As I’m leaving with them, this guy walks out in front of my car with his phone in the air. He starts knocking on my window and I carefully drive past him as he’s yelling. Weird, but I checked with my passengers and they’re definitely the right people. 

Then I get a call. Turns out Lyft somehow accepted a ride automatically and I was completely clueless to it. This passenger was aggressive and honestly rightfully so. It looked like I totally snubbed him and took the wrong people. 

Lyft is so pushy to make you do things you don’t want to do. Fuck them.","The only way to avoid that is tapping Last Ride as soon as you accept a ping. Make it a habit.

Sometimes after you officially drop someone off on the app, Lyft will automatically add another ride. And you can't even see that new rider's rating. 

Lyft is definitely shady as fuck. I hate the auto match. It's almost always a ride another driver skipped for a reason. The most annoying thing for me is when Lyft automatically adds a ride and that new rider calls you immediately while you still have another passenger in the car who has no clue what's going on.

Those gets removed from the queue 100% of the time. Lyft’s log off feature is bad, like what’s it there for if it doesn’t do the job right? 

Seems like a built in feature, I remember how sneaky it was at accepting rides on your behalf, often times I found it auto queued and accepted rides the moment I hit drop off passenger giving me no option whatsoever to decline. I remember complaining about it on the lyftdrivers sub but some guys were like be thankful you have that option, my market is slow... I understand your frustration auto adding rides. I usually decline when they pop up.  However, yesterday they auto added and i didn’t decline... turned out to be $112 fare.  If you don’t decline and just log off, i think the added ride is still on, hence the ability of passenger to call you. I'm never one to take up for Lyft, but I can't drill them too badly for that system....

I know Uber got sued (think it's still in the courts actually) by a passenger who was involved in a wreck that occurred after the driver received an add-on request, and accepted it. As you may or may not know, when you are on a ride with Uber and it's busy and they want to throw atripping your queue, it comes across styled as a regular ride request, that you have to accept physically. As Uber found out, that does in fact create liability issues vis a vis distracted driving.

I hate the auto add as well, ESPECIALLY when it plops me a 4.7 rating I would never accept otherwise, but what's the alternative if both methods are unacceptable?   I've thought about this more than once.... if lyft ever adds a rider automagically, i wait until my current ride is completely done, open the next ride, and I magically cancel that shit.  I have maybe done 1 out of 100 auto queues. Silly not to take the ride. You put yourself in that situation. Don't turn on Uber until you hit drop off on Lyft."

I always see Honda Fits, Hyundai Elantras, Civics, Accords, and Cruzes around town with the Lyft sticker on them, but I was shocked to see one on a Tesla.

I agree it is nuts to drive anything fancy because pax will destroy them and think nothing of it let alone tip accordingly. People should expect a clean safe ride and thats it. There is a guy that does airport runs like I do. He’s in a Mercedes G wagon. Porsche Cayenne back when Uber first started in Miami.

Denver Lyft joke.,18,57.279258013425604,Lyft,"That's the joke. 

Every day for the last 2 weeks I am seeing uber surging at most points during the day. Never chase the surge? I drove 6 miles into a $22 surge zone and drove a guy 5 miles and made $30. 

Lyft literally gives me zero reasons to sign on.","I learned this same thing. Yesterday I was on the road in Denver for 2 hours and only got 2 rides when they said it was a high traffic area. In 2 hours I made $10. This shit is offensive now I sign on to both on destination filter sometimes too increase my chances but so far Lyft hasn't beaten Uber for a ping. Uber seems to have some surge most of the time so screw Lyft. In the last 3-4 weeks it seems like the ppz and ride bonuses, aka surge bonus, have been nonexistent in Denver Lyft pays better when it's slow. But ya fuck em when it's busy. If Uber’s not busy I’m going home. I depend on tips to make this gig work. Maintaining my vehicle is not cheap. All rides under $5 are a loss to my business. A few isn’t so bad but when it’s your entire day that’s a big whole in your wallet. I want to be in a position where  I can get even just a few $10+ rides. So I’m not driving around my city like a desperate fool. Shhhhhhhh I have my weekly goal set to $1. There are some weeks I don't hit that, doing Uber only. I turn on both apps and literally only do XL or 45+ minutes on Lyft. I’m also in Denver. www.dryvline.com for Denver drivers that want to know where to go!!!!! The only thing Lyft has over Uber now is destination mode.

Uber's sucks. I lived in Boulder and put destination mode and it gave me a fucking ride 20 miles past downtown Denver. Lyft is accurate with the destination at least Yeah, I learned a while ago to just stick to my normal route and same times/days, and to forget about surges and PPZ, because I value my sanity.

Yeah it sucks when my buddy driving solely on Uber makes 20 to 30% more than me on a day where things are especially jacked up downtown, but my income is now extremely reliable if not mediocre, and it's been a LITTLE bit better for signing people up to my private business....

Lyft can't keep this up, they simply cannot. Unless the leadership is even more retarded than I give them credit for oh, this simply won't last.

I don't go anywhere near large events, and I know the vast majority of Lyft drivers in my market are doing the same. It's pretty easy to tell, because whenever large events are letting out, I can be 10 miles away and get pings to the event, which I promptly refuse. But oh my Lord do they keep coming!

Obviously, the only way this can happen is if there's nobody closer to take these rides. What is hilarious, is that none of these ever pop with a bonus. Lyft is losing money hand-over-fist when it comes to events (and far-out suburbia) and frankly they don't seem to give a shit. 

I say this can't last because at some point, the shareholders are going to force change. I have no clue how that change will present itself, and I'm certainly not saying it will be in our favor, but the status quo simply can't continue.

I would also like to point out that one of the reasons Uber is surging so consistently now is The Exodus of drivers from Lyft, which means more people are calling for Uber rides, and this is especially true at events.  (I can really only speak for my market though....)"

The wording should be ""which includes"".   Friggen morons. Think you’re reading this wrong. Simply means when you’re doing taxes you have to deduct all the income that Lyft deducted. Fucking annoying.

I handed my Lyft tax docs over to my accountant last year and almost overpaid by $1500. Lyft doesn’t actually inform you how much you made after they take their cut. Instead, they just give you total gross that you made for both you and the company. That said, you have to do some math and subtract their cut of the total gross income in order to have an accurate income for your personal taxes. I wonder if they're going to do a 1099-k or something... I get those from iTunes every year and my tax guy always gets confused because it shows the total amount they collected on my behalf (including their cut). It's a bit of a pain, but never had a problem. I hope that's what Lyft means... Otherwise that's going to create a mess. Yes, this is the proper way to do this for Lyft. Just like PayPal, Amazon, Etsy and all the rest. They report the total, you deduct the fees and their cut. This is how the IRS wants it done. You don't pay any more taxes at all. Paying the lyft platform fee.. becaaauuuse you're using their platform ?

Isn't this kinda like ""owning"" a McDonald's franchise but being mad you have to pay McDonald's when you ""own your own restaurant"" ? Hahahaha! Hahahaha! Bahahaha! *[coughs]* Hehehahahaha!

Also demanding the driver give her money back - clearly she doesn't know how this works. I was once with a friend of mine. We were chilling at a party and it turned out we were both going the same direction after the party. Well his baby mama drops his kid off just as he requested a Lyft SHARED and sent me thr request to split it. 

He got so pissed when I told him I was gonna catch my own Lyft. However, I wasn't willing to put myself or the driver in an awkward situation. Plus, I only do shared rides when I have time to kill. Not when I need to be somewhere. So ya this girl is insane. #Trash So many wrong things in this video. (Putting in perspective what ride sharing is)

Pax is an entitled person and the driver in typical ride share fashion blocks a street. 

First time he parked there was clearly enough space for him to pull over and not block the street. He didn’t 

Second time he parked blocking the entire street, he could have pulled forward more and parked in front of the other parked cars. 

The pax is an entitled person that does not care about anything but her. Tell them they need to pay cash so you may return cash change to them.  Then drive off with whatever cash they hand you. I’ve noticed that certain paxs, (read *ghetto*), don’t quite understand how things work. I had a similar thing, a family of 5 requested a regular Lyft with a kid without a car seat. When I said I was cancelling, it turned into the same, 

>Nah-uuhhh. I **PAID** you. You gonna take me or **YOU** gimme my money back!

Night Drivers: Stop being showboats and hide your Amp light,7,58.42708208754659,Lyft,"Last night I was parked at a supermarket parking lot waiting for rides, and a Lyft driver pulled up with loud music, AMP on, headlights on, and blocked the entrance for a few minutes until a security guard came and told him to move.

This is an entertainment complex with numerous restaurants, bars, and stores, which banned Uber and Lyft drivers from coming inside the complex. Now we must drop off and pick up at a cul-de-sac outside of the complex and move along.

They implemented this policy because drivers were going inside and taking the parking spaces while waiting for a ride. And of course many had their shining AMPs and Uber Beacons turned on for the world to see. Some would even double park with their headlights on, drawing attention to themselves. 

The special thing about this complex is that most rides out of there on weekends are longer and profitable, but since there isn't a nearby place to stage now, it's more difficult to catch one. You have to really get lucky while driving by. 

My point is, if you drive at night, try to be more incognito while waiting for rides in private parking lots. Take off your stickers and airport permit. You're not getting an airport ride at midnight. Your AMP is enough, but you don't have to light it up until you're arriving to pickup a passenger. 

Most security guards in these lots are cool until you become a nuisance and make them look bad, and then everybody pays the price for your idiocy.","""Staging grounds."" You cant expect something to be secret forever. Also, drivers can see your location vis the pax app when you're online, so all these ""secret"" locations will be found eventually.

I personally get bored and just follow other drivers around sometimes to see how others do it. 

I never bothered using this amp though. I dont wanna advertise for lyft. I dont want it to be known that im a driver when i riding through a busy area that's surging. It only makes people think of lyft, which is a company i dispise. tl;dr explanation: security guard finally started asking drivers waiting in their parking lot at night to leave.

Waiting in a shopping mall private parking lot at night while its closed is creepy and weird. Cops can and will be called and op can and will be trespassed. OP is lucky the security guard asked questions first. Lmao my amp is permanently on my dresser as some type of nite light"
Reasons not to use Lyft,24,58.60475569866874,Lyft,Image,"TLDR: everything is bad. I never thought about it that way. I guess I should start drinking and driving again. Lyft and Uber have filled in the gaps were mass transit falls short. Busses and light rails are good, but they’re rigid in the times they operate. Taxis are quite expensive in comparison. Stallman would have us use almost nothing. While some of his points have some validity, he’s out of touch. /rolleyes"
Lyft investigating possible community guideline violation.,12,58.73391079126132,Lyft,So I got an email from Lyft the other day saying that my driver account is on hold while they investigate a possible violation of the community guidelines (I dont recall doing anything) and they won't respond to me or give any updates. Has this happened to anyone else here?,"Probably a passenger reported you for something you didn't do so they could get a free ride. I lost 9 days of pay and a $38 scheduled ride all because of a ghetto bitch cussing me out and trying to get me to argue with her for no reason. I reported her to Lyft as soon as the ride ended but 10 minutes later received an email saying she reported that I was under the influence. 9 fucking days of me emailing and calling before I finally heard from someone. Why it took them 9 days to figure out that it was a false report is beyond me. You guys have to realize that 9 times out of 10, it's not something you have done. These people are broke and desperate, maybe on drugs. They don't care if you lose your job as long as they can get a free ride. I should have drenched that bitch in cold soda when I had the chance. Had I known I'd be off Lyft for 9 days because of her, I would have. Good luck, took them nine days to get back to me before it was resolved. Yeah Lyft is famous for this bullshit. They deactivate first, ask questions later. If a passenger wants to be petty, they can just make up some bullshit to get you deactivated while they “investigate”. No way to prove they are lying. Tweet about it. I did the same thing when someone falsely accused me of being under the influence to get a free ride. I still missed out on working during the super bowl but it was solved in like a day. They don’t like when you call them out publicly. The minute you have an issue like this go into a Lyft office in person. It's the only way to resolve their Bs in a timely manner. Just call them and ask to get it resolved. Getting to the right place for a call is difficult though.

Thinking about joining Lyft as a driver,17,58.887151532015864,Lyft,"I'm from the Glendale-Los Angeles area in California, and last week a friend of mine showed me his earnings from being a driver on Lyft. He said he averages around 1500 - 1700 a week. I'm a programmer and graphic designer and make decent money working a full-time job. But I'm not that happy where I work anymore, so I'm looking to Lyft to make some money while I look for something else. I'd like to start driving and have signed up already. Are there any tips, tricks or things I need to know before I start? Should I sign up for their car rental? Thanks for any of the help.","I've been driving in L.A. for 5 years. This is the slowest Lyft has ever been. $1500 a week gross is not impossible if you're doing both Uber and Lyft, but you'd still have to work 60-70 hours.  


L.A. is a grossly over-saturated market, and with such horrible traffic, you really have to get creative to scratch out a living wage, let alone $1500-$1700. A couple of things to consider: how long has your friend been driving? Also, how many hours per week does he have to put in to get those numbers?

It may take some time to learn your market and optimize your rides and earnings. If your friend is taking 70-80 hours to get those numbers it may not be worth it for you. 

I recommend, for starters, watching some YouTube videos to kind of see what people recommend. But nothing is better than getting out there and testing it out. If I see him tomorrow I'll ask to see everything again and verify.  As for the hours, I guess I'm wrong, so I'll find out the correct info.  He didn't give me a referral code or link. It just came up in conversation. It's an oversaturated market. Go serve tables at a restaurant."
At least once a week.,36,58.891873754238084,Lyft,Image,"Had this right today. Guy entered the car mumbling ""shit shit shit I'm so late shit shit"", and I laughed loudly, as in two seconds cling-cling another rider was added. ""Overslept?"" I asked, ""No, a fukin bus failed on me"". Why are you surprised uber/lyft riders are cheap and stingy with money some of them don’t even thank you for the ride, they order whats cheapest I'm always Blown Away by that. They know that they have to be somewhere at a certain time but then they request a shared. Then they get mad when other people get in. I always just give them the look. I never say anything, I just keep on going. what else can you do? They never get the connection that I am at work. MY. THOUGHTS. EXACTLY. The WORST is when you wait so long in the airport queue and they send you a damn shared ride🤬 had this happen to me yesterday. they added THREE people to the ride as i was driving to pick up zone. I get there and they all had multiple bags/luggage. 

Who TF orders a shared ride then has a bunch of bags!? I ended up having to cancel the last guy because the car was full and when i called him he was still inside the damn terminal😩 Decline shared rides. LMFAO, too true. At this point, I like it when shared riders pile in 3 at a time. I like to think that they're punishing themselves lol I had a rider get pissed that I had to pick up a third person so she just... got out of the car lol. Then of course she couldn't get a new ride because I couldn't end her trip so she got super pissed and kept texting and calling me. I told her she had to cancel and how to do that but I guess she couldn't figure it out. Pretty sure she didn't make it to her bar exam or whatevet Had a pax not clearly define where they were in a building the size of a city block with at least 4 entrances I ALWAYS deny Shared/Pools and if they get added automatically I cancel them. Has this shit happen with 2 pissed off drunk ""hood rats"" at midnight on a 21 mile ride. First ping after getting in they flipped out so I just kept canceling rides until I dropped them off. I know. Happens to me all the time in the Bay Area too. I hate to say it but especially among the african american females are the demographic that this happens especially often with. Do you guys accept majority of shared rides or decline"
To those who think Lyft takes more from shared rides... Get bent.,6,58.94529968017505,Lyft,Image,"And wut? I have a screen with raiders paid $113 while I got $44. So? It doesn’t really matter though I guess, because they’re pouring money into self driving technology and rushing to tap into that market. They see the cost savings of automation and their plan is to replace all their drivers with robots anyway - as fast as possible. Lyft could easily be profitable if they weren’t so fucking greedy. It’s really simple honestly -  and it starts with providing a good service. Lyft’s CEO lives in a multi-million dollar mansion but the company isn’t profitable? That’s a joke. 

If Lyft paid their drivers a reasonable wages and actually valued them as employees, they would get much better drivers and in turn their customers would get much better service. 

Right now, if you go to Lyft’s Facebook page, the entire page is filled with complaints and angry rants. Passengers complaining about drivers driving recklessly, stealing personal items, behaving inappropriately,  not speaking or understanding English, charging them fraudulently, the list goes on and on. 

Drivers complaining about low pay and wage cuts, high  gas and repair expenses, high insurance costs, drunk and disrespectful passengers....it’s not a good look for Lyft. 

Lyft had an opportunity to be the “better” Uber. They could have let Uber be the shitty company with the shitty drivers that pays less and produces lower quality. Instead, they focused on short term profits over long term growth and that is why they are hemorrhaging money. Now they slash driver pay to ridiculous lows to try and make up for it. Really really sad,"

why do you hate disabled people?,43,59.06833208759073,Lyft," [https://abc7news.com/society/sf-woman-with-disability-says-lyft-drivers-repeatedly-cancel-her-rides/5460706/](https://abc7news.com/society/sf-woman-with-disability-says-lyft-drivers-repeatedly-cancel-her-rides/5460706/) 

&#x200B;

why do you guys cancel on disabled people? Is their money not green enough?","I don't hate anybody. Except for you, I now hate you because you generalize all drivers like this. One of my worst rides ever was a blind person. Pulled up next to her and opened the door for her, asked if she needed help and get a sassy ""I don't need your help."" I said fine and told her the door was literally 2 steps in front of her, but she still couldn't find my car. I waited. Finally she's in and settled, let's out the nastiest fart, plus she clearly hadn't bathed in some time, possibly weeks. 20 minute ride later, we get to her destination on a shady street with no visible house numbers. I ask if she is meeting someone, and if they could be called to come out and help her. She says in a sassy tone ""I don't need help, I know where it is."" I said ""fine, ok, I'll let you out at the corner of X and X street, it's right at the destination pin on my map. I think your house is right across the street. Ok?"" She says ok and I let her out. Having to pull a U-turn to get back to a main road, I watch her wander aimlessly around the street hitting curbs and sign posts with her stick, obviously lost. She said she didn't need my help, so I didn't help. I just watched to make sure she didn't fall down or something. Someone finally came out of the house to get her, and flipped me off as I drove past. 1 star, sorry not sorry. I personally don't mind dogs of any kind, as long as they're well behaved and groomed.  I'll allow them if I ever get a request like that.

Some people need service animals for their disability and they are covered under the ADA.  But there's a flip-side to this as well... Some people are allergic to animals and that is also a disability covered by the ADA.  If push comes to shove, it's a lose-lose.  Those two disabilities are polar opposites, both technically protected, but of course Lyft sides with the customer because that's where the money is.

Just take a look at Lyft's service animal policy.  Drivers can bring their service animal along with them, but the passenger is free to discriminate against the disabled driver and can refuse the ride and have it cancelled.  Then the driver gets screwed out of that potential trip.

>*It’s Lyft’s policy that drivers are permitted to ride with their service animals.*  
>  
>*....some passengers may be uncomfortable around your service animal and will ask you to cancel their request.  If they’re unable to ride with your service animal, you must cancel the ride so they can request another driver.*

Ethically speaking, you shouldn't refuse service animals.  But legally, neither side is required to show any formal documentation for their disability, whether it be for their animal or an allergy against them. The only time I ever hated taking a dog was picking up two chicks and a great dane that had just been soaked in the rain. Whole car reeked of wet dog after. Other than that, I don't mind pets, my own dogs ride with me off duty sometimes. The handicapped passengers that I fucking hate are the ones who expect you to pull up and get out and fold up their walker or wheelchair and load it up for them and then help lift their fat asses into the car. Before I used to just tell them that we can't lift them or touch their belongings out of liability issues and would get cussed out and reported. Now I just show them my handicap parking sign and tell them that I'm also handicapped and I can't lift them or their stuff and then they don't cuss me out, they're just disappointed and cancel. If Lyft knows better, they'll never try to force me into lifting passengers or their stuff seeing as how I am also disabled. This article makes it seem like this lady is all puppy dogs and roses. I bet there is more to the story here. Im going to guess she is a raging bitch and puts that off right from the offset of pulling up. Service dogs are supposed to be allowed in Lyft rides but it IS up to the driver's prerogative to cancel if they want to or have to. It's shitty of them to do it to this lady though, since it clearly shows ""Service Dog"" and she has a tarp for the dog. I've had people bring dogs in my car but I always ask if they can ""keep the dog off the seats"" and if they dont, or dont have a tarp or something, 1 star for them. I had a woman today who was going to the hospital for a treatment, I won't say for what. She chatted my ear off, but was overall very pleasant and gave me a solid $4 on an $8 fare. No complaints here. I was literally bringing someone to a hospital appointment for treatment of their illness which was causing them chronic disability. I didn't say so explicitly, but it's pretty clearly implied I just automatically hate everyone and everything forcing me to do anything against my free will. ADA included. I always accept people with pets, and see no any problems with that, but if I ever will get a request from someone with service animal - sure I will accept it, but one star for him granted for sure. Just because. And that because is: if for whatever reason I would need to cancel that, like my car broke, or I got some diarrhea, or my daughter calls and says she fell off the stairs and broke her arm - those freaks don't care, they report and get driver deactivated. That's why I hate them, and will always do. My mom is disabled and I would never turn her away. We have a service dog and she is more than welcome in my car. Anyone who is disabled is welcome and I don’t discriminate against anyone. Every driver is different but it is against Lyft policy to refuse a service animal. The drivers doing this (ignoring or cancelling rides) don’t represent everyone who works with Lyft. There are a lot of different people with different views but that doesn’t mean that EVERYONE hates disabled people."
Only 4 rides left until bonus offer ends in 90 minutes. Am I the only one who does this to themselves?,30,59.30882977277592,Lyft,Image,"Atleast you still get bonuses 😒 Jeez, thats a tough one, out there at 3 am on a Sunday night trying to scrounge rides and you need 4 more in 30 minutes. In Portland of all places. ( not, say NYC) Did you make it? I always get long rides in this situation and freakout. Yeah pretty much. Big difference between that and old PDB@ 20% which ended two years ago this month. It ended up being $250-$300 a week for full-timers. 

Drivers would take that random 90 minute ride from the train station at midnight, get home at 2am then get up at 6 to start over. 

Those days are dead as a doornail.

I saw one PPZ this week over $4 in my market and it was during a heinous thunderstorm. Hard no. Uuuuffff that's tough OP. 

How'd it end up going? get a couple friends to request rides while they're right next you. you can give each friend 2 ""rides"" that count towards the bonus. pay them back the $3 for each ride. fingers crossed that the bonus is worth more than you pay out. ?????no profit Damn son. If I were trying, getting 57 rides is super easy in Chicago. Portland must suck, or you must be very very new.

Edit: I once was 4 rides away from the 3rd bonus but it was 4am and I was stir crazy by the time I got home so it wasn't worth no 90 dollars. I really need to know.. did you make it? 57 for $61?!? What the fuck i need to ride 75 rides to get a ""bonus"" $60"

Lost Phone - What To Do...?,18,59.58974412463881,Lyft,"Hiya,

So I am (was...?  slowly drifting toward ""was"") a big Lyft fan.  All of Uber's bro culture and persona, never having a female uber driver (after about 2 years of using Uber, not ONE female driver in all of that time), and I grabbed onto Lyft and didn't let go.  Hell, I would correct friends who'd say ""call an uber"" with ""call a lyft.""  I am (was...?) IN, a fanboy.

One time, about 3 years ago, I forgot something in the trunk of a Lyft on a business trip.  I flew home and didn't even miss it.  Turned on my phone and there's a Lyft message saying the driver was trying to get in touch with me to return it. I was like ""whoa, OK, thanks,"" spoke with the driver and sent him Paypal for his time and trouble + shipping cost of shipping it back, then I tacked on an additional $50 on what we'd agreed to since he'd been cool about the whole thing.

Then another time, about 6 months ago, returning a rental car, I had taken off my jacket because it'd be hotter than normal and left it in the backseat.  Got a call about 3 minutes after I got out of the car; got charged the $15 returned item charge and tipped the driver an extra $20 for turning around and coming back.

Then this weekend, something weird, then something bad happened.

The weird thing: I called a Lyft Line after seeing a movie with friends.  I hopped into it and head home.  There was an extra bottle of wine from the dinner we'd had earlier, so I had that in a plastic bag, but I'd noticed (even with a few glasses of wine earlier that evening) that the guy driving didn't look like his photo.  Like younger, light facial hair, glasses.  He had a weird energy too, like...dunno.  He just screamed ""sketchy"" but it was a Lyft Line, I'm a pretty big guy, and figured, ""meh.""

We get home to my place and within 10 minutes of me walking into the door, I realize I don't have my phone (I left the bottle of wine on the car floor as well, but it was a doggy bag so \*shrugs\*).  At first, I'm shocked as the thing is attached to me, but I pop on the ""Find my phone"" app and sure enough, there it is on GPS driving away, about a couple of miles away.  I immediately contact using the ""lost an item"" button and it goes to Lyft Support.

Here's where things get weird.

Lyft support tells me they'll contact the driver who'll contact me to arrange on how to get it back to me.  I tell them I'm glad to take another lyft to meet him wherever, or he can charge me for the trip from wherever he is to meet me.  I can do it tonight, tomorrow, whenever, utterly at his convenience.  Was also cool with him leaving it at a concierge at a hotel during his travels.  I told them I'd gladly pay him that fee plus an additional tip of $75 for the hassle.  I told them I'd be glad to pay that in advance in case he thought I was going to stiff him.

They quickly reiterated that they were a ""cashless platform"" and could only discuss transactions that happened on the platform.  I apologized and told them I'd be happy to do it all as one giant tip.

Meanwhile, on Find My Phone, the car is getting further and further away, more like 8 miles now.  No call (I have GV so I can get calls on my laptop) or text message.

The phone/car stops around 2 hours later.  I've been (politely) going back/forth with Lyft service the entire time to ask them to pass along my ""I will work around whatever he wants"" messages to him.  I finally tap out and go to bed, my phone at 15% battery about 8 miles away.  I flirt with the idea of catching another Lyft to show up wherever his car is, but that felt creepy so I waited.

When I wake up, the first thing I do is check the app:  phone is down to 3% and it's even FURTHER away now, more like 11 miles away.  After about an hour, I get good news:  they've contacted the driver and he's found my phone (and the wine).  I'm like COOL, he was working, but now he's got me:  gonna get my phone back.  I send them the same open ended: ""what's he need to bring it, and he's got it"" messages.

Once again, hours go by.  My phone's battery drops to 2%, then dies.  Every couple of hours, I ping them and ask if there's been any word, they say ""no, driver has not been responding"" with repeated reminders that ""the reason why many ppl drive for Lyft is the ability to not respond"" and ""Lyft is not responsible for lost or stolen items,"" and ""the drivers are independent contractors,"" etc.

This goes on all day.  Finally I give up and break out my old-old backup phone and swap the # out and log out of the accounts remotely (the missing phone is encrypted, so the average human can't break into it, and it hasn't been reactivated).  I ask a manager on the messaging thread, ""why can't you just suspend his use of the app until he responds...?"" and he said it wasn't policy as it's not the driver's responsibility to deal with lost items.  And I get that, but once he says he HAS them...?

OK, so:

1. What gives?  I don't think he stole the phone (or, rather, I don't think he intentionally wanted to keep it once he found it), as he would have never told them he had the phone in the first place, if so.  And technically he can't ""steal"" it as I lost it (although it's that kind of thinking that leads to kidnapping charges).
2. What offer to I need to throw at this guy to get him to bring the phone back?  $75 for a 45 minute ride seemed like a pretty nice deal, but...more...?  If so, how much?
3. Is it that sketchiness I picked up on earlier: is the driver that drove me driving under someone else's account and now he's scared to see me in the light of day or contact me using his buddy's name?
4. Any other advice?

I have to say: this has been a crappy experience.  My love affair with Lyft is well and truly over...Yes, it's my fault and my responsibility for having it fall out of my pocket, but ""customer service"" should still be a thing...and Lyft just throwing up hands when a driver gets weird (and, I'm sorry, this is WEIRD: I offered him what he'd probably make in 3 hours for one quick trip), they should be able to do...something.  Certainly more than apologies and cut/paste boilerplate.

There needs to be a way for passengers, through the app, to still contact drivers within a certain window of time; the driver can certainly block them if they get stalker-y or dangerous, but I feel like if he and I could have just gotten on the phone, we'd have wrapped this up.

Open to suggestions...

No, there is literally nothing Lyft (or Uber)  will do. Have fun going back to Taxi's (they don't return your shit either) He seemed sketchy, but I’m a pretty big guy. Not real bright, but big!

Hope that phone was backed up to a cloud...cause it’s gone, big guy.

Quit leaving your your shit in rideshares.  ""why can't you just suspend his use of the app until he responds...?"" 

This is just one great example of why you never admit to Lyft/Uber or the passenger that you have their item if you don't feel like dealing with returning it. 

I once had a drunk lady drop her phone in my car, started blowing me up the next day when I left to start working again, was told that I would be in touch with her at some point THAT day to return her phone as I was currently working.  She did not accept that and told me if I did not return it before 5pm she would call the police and report it stolen as I admitted I had her phone in a text. I said that's fine, I wouldn't admit to having it if I were trying to steal it but you want to interrupt my shift and cost me money instead of waiting until later today to get it back and you aren't even offering compensation or anything. Turns out her sister was a cop and she called and told me to return it before 5pm or they'd come get me for theft, so I had no choice but to return it on her terms and lose tons of surge fares.  

After that I stopped returning phones and started throwing them off overpasses and watching them shatter. Today I picked up a lady who had two stops and the first one was at a store. She said she'd be right back out but wasn't so I ended her ride and left. My next pick up was two guys and they get in and say there's a item and a item back here. I was like well crap, someone must have left their stuff. I honestly thought she had taken it with her, had I seen it, I would have left it outside for her. Before I could even drop them off and go into my app to report that I found items, I received a message about a rider reporting that I argued with them blah blah blah. I did not argue with this woman at all. I just ended her ride because she took too long. I was going to be nice and return her stuff, but after that I said nope, screw her. Her crap is now floating out somewhere in the world. Wow you really don’t know how Lyft and Uber works.  They’re both lead agencies.  Any good experience has been just by chance.  

You’re being driven by random strangers, with 0 supervision and 0 customer support.   There’s no difference between Uber or Lyft.  Literally the marketing ploy of “Pink not Black” worked on you.

Did that experience of not having your phone for 24 hours giving you a panic attack and being unable to happily live your life...adjust your priorities? To much to read, have a great night your options are to wait for the driver to decide to return it, or file a police report.  it's great you had a lot of good experiences with lost items in the past -- many of us drivers don't mind getting people their items back.  But it's not part of the job and there are consequences to leaving your stuff behind. if it was a taxi, train, airplane, etc you wouldn't be so butthurt"

How is it my fault you aren’t making enough money. If you want more money find a different profession.

Although your in the wrong to assume he needs to find another profession. You as a customer are getting an awesome deal at a fraction of a nasty taxi. Maybe you should consider that and tip your driver. Always tip your drivers if you want good service. This should go well.... Do you not tip your server at a restaurant? If you live in California then your server makes minimum wage plus tips. So if you tip your server then why not your driver? Well your driver sounds like an idiot. That being said, your attitude towards people who don't come from money needs some serious work. Most of us don't have it as easy as you, A $5 tip goes a long way. Poor angry man. Silly to ever expect a tip. Everyone knows rich people don't tip I’m a driver and I’m just here for the drivers who expect everything lmfao I was determined to side with you until the “find a different profession” crap

You entitled douchebag.  I can only imagine what he observed within you to make him demand a tip You know what, I wish more drivers had the gumption to say what that driver said and put twerps like you in their place. Tip your driver. I mean, if he's absolutely horrible, that's one thing, but otherwise, you're an asshole if you don't. And yes, what the driver said was unprofessional, but someone had to say it and good for him for teaching you a valuable lesson. I hope you've learned it. Your parents make $600k a year. You make 185k a year. You didn’t tip on a $30 Lyft ride. You’re the asshole. Lol How do they evne know? Sometimes I tip hours later He's wrong with the lecture but I totally support him. Just a heads up to riders... if you want a guaranteed 5\* rating tip. ( in cash). If you don't give a shit carry on.

&#x200B;

BTW, who you gonna call when most of the drivers take your advice and quit? What an entitled douche. Get a job in the service industry that relies on tips and see how your attitude changes. I swear rich people tip the least and are the most annoying. Just tip your driver for Christ's sake. There are always going to be people in the service industry, looking down on them and telling them to get better jobs won't help anyone. If everyone could do that, there would be no workers left to cater to your entitled a$$. Tel them they have a nice house. They’ll tip. People are mad they aren't getting rich cruising around in their own cars.

And pretending they aren't with things like no.. no.. we just want a liveable wage.

If it isn't working for them.. they should move on same reason people aren't working @ McDonald's expecting 6 figures."
Is the cancellation fee that much of a wallet breaker?,67,59.68583208761557,Lyft,Image,"Wow. What a crazy thing. On behalf of all passengers; I apologize profusely for that passenger.  

That kind of behaviour is beyond unacceptable. I really hope she didn't get her cancel fee refunded. All that BS over $5. That drive handled this very well. I don’t miss this shit at all. Glad I stopped driving lol. I thought a cancellation fee was like $15. I’ve only ever had to charge it one time. 1. Why didnt he just cancel the trip?

2. Why did he just sit there after? Lol Am I the only one that noticed “it probably won’t even go through” that means she never had any intention of ACTUALLY paying for the ride to begin with. Her card didn’t have enough money and she was banking on it being declined She became internet-famous for only $5. What a deal! LOL As a Bay Area driver I think it's hilarious that someone would consider $5 a ""wallet breaker"" XD Is that a Vantrue dashcam?  Just got mine.  
Props for keeping cool.  I have this same interaction several times a week. 20$ cash up front and hop in bytches Trim that beard and don't stick around for the debate. He just wasted 5 minutes or more. Keep your effing doors locked. i've found that some riders assume the cancel fee is the entire amount of the ride, so they might be out $30, $60, $100, they are not thinking about $5 most of the time."
Does anyone know if emails are still being sent to riders after they have been dropped off? Feels like my tips are way down and I have not changed anything. Just curious,15,60.00989458761557,Lyft,,"I noticed this too 😭😭 I used to get major tips, and now there are days where i will go without a single tip in 20+ rides but my rating always stays super high. It feels like there not sending a follow up email to rate the riders experience and an option to tip. I could be off but feels like that’s what’s happening Prices went up...i still tip though 🤷‍♀️ I stopped driving for lyft for now. Uber has been enough I always get one.. denver. And I also get a text message. I have had sign in my car for the longest time its helps with the tips but you have to be creative with the sign not just straight ask for tips I get 4 out of 15 riders tipping OMG! ME TOO!! I, too, independently noticed that my tips have declined recently. My tips have also gone down recently. I put a sign on the back of my front seats that says TIPS GREATLY APPRECIATED! It seems to be helping a little bit. School is back, people aren’t tipping is much"
"I'm going to lose my mind if I hear another drunk female Pax begin a sentence with ""I literally...""",16,60.38021866170069,Lyft,My brains are literally leaking out of my ears right now...,"I literally know exactly what you mean Better be prepared to literally lose your mind, then. Brad Chads saying “lowkey” or “facts” Like also using ‘like’, like every other word. Like

I'm sorry that must be really hard Major dictionaries are literally carrying a definition for that word now that just means added emphasis. Annoys me even more when pronounced ""lit-ra-ly"". How about the retards saying low-key before every sentence? Bruh and legit are annoying af too and using gucci gets you two stars. Literally. Used to annoy me until I looked it up and found out they were using that word correctly. I like female pax. They are more conversational, and as long they haven’t had 20 drinks, I’m cool. However, they are not the best tippers (no offense). You’re in the wrong line of work."
Amp question!,9,60.53972097652654,Lyft,Lyft tells me my city doesn't offer the Amp yet but I see plenty of people driving around with them! How is this possible? I would love to have one and think they're pretty nifty. Thanks!,"Maybe they purchased them online. Or maybe Lyft simply sent one to them. When they first launched in L.A. they sent me three, so I don't think they keep good track of them. Bought mine on craigslist for 40$ AFTER I hit 250 rides and realized Lyft wasn't sending me one. The only thing I can figure is that maybe they live in an adjoining or nearby city, but most of the business is in a city that doesn’t have one (where you live). I see that also; my app says that my city area doesn’t have them, but I see many drivers with them. I do live in an area where there are quite a few cities in a relatively small area (for scale the area around me has 19 cities including mine and is slightly bigger than San Antonio), so what I said would definitely explain this. It could be what other commenters are saying (buying them) but I really don’t think as many people as I see with them would be willing to buy them. Also, I had a passenger a few weeks ago who was also a Lyft driver, and he told me that he’d had a high number of rides in the time he’s been doing Lyft, and had already earned the amp and had received it, and he lived in a city that bordered mine. Don't buy one. So people could have relocated and already had one You can buy them on eBay If you want one, buy one. It's your money, spend it on whatever you want 🙂"
"Yea boys, I am showing Lyft who is Boss by driving 1 or 2 people only per day at night where there is minimal risk to get rear ended and spirit our $2,500 deductible. Doing this pays car payment lol",13,60.60857514319321,Lyft,Image,"Umm... If you get rear ended, it was probably not your fault, so you wouldn't be paying a deductible as the other person's insurance would cover your vehicle.

So as long as you aren't at fault, the $2500 doesn't matter. Just out of curiosity, is your phone set to a language that’s not English? I’m wondering why it say “US$” Congrats on doing Lyft the way it should be used! Whenever you feel like it for some extra cash. I go online at home, when I am indifferent about watching some TV or taking a ride request. The moment you rely on rideshare for $ you start stressing out. Just do 1 or 2 rides a day, and live a minimalist ride-sharing lifestyle and still get your monthly car payment paid Sorry, that just shows them you’re still their bitch. If you *really* wanted to show them who’s boss, you’d accept rides and not pick them up. Make them cancel on you. Make them wait. That way, they will go to Uber or a taxi instead. Meh, no car payment and I don't have to worry about any of it. I do minimal on lyft too. Then highest ride count i got this week in a day, has been 9. 25 total rides this week.

I use to be at 50 to 60, when i cared about Lyft.

Not in rental program. I just go at my leisure. It's less stressful this way You read the contract, know the deductible is high as fuck. Then you actually have to use the deductible - and now your sticking it to Lyft by only doing two runs?

This thread has AIDS.

You should feel bad because this plan is dumb as hell. Sorry."
A friendly request.,9,60.73681588393394,Lyft,"When in a busy urban city like Minneapolis, please don’t have us be summoned on a city street crowded with cars and busses.

Does anyone run another side business while they drive - such as day trading or an online business of some kind?,48,61.10847097654034,Lyft,If so - how do you manage to run your business on the go?  What is your routine like?,"I trap squirrels.  Mostly just to add a little protein to the stewpot.   Rideshare only provides the basics. Im a freelance photographer mostly for sports. So when its slow I drive. I frequently am editing or culling on the iPad while waiting at the airport. There was a guy here who dumpster dives between rides. He said his best week was flipping refurbished medical equipment just sitting there waiting to be picked up. Something like $7000. 

Though typically he says he makes under a few hundred a week on broken printers 🖨 and such. I sell stuff on eBay. I go to thrifts and flip stuff. Sometimes I even take pictures of the stuff in the trunk of the car and do listings in between rides. I also sell shit on Facebook market place. Do a lot of meet ups for sales on the road. Waiting on xrp to moon! I rent out my photography studio to photographers on an hourly rate. I saw a guy selling food/drinks from his trunk at the airport waiting lot. Well, I saw a Doterra Uber last night. YouTube channel Forex trading... but i dont do it at the same time. You need to concentrate on your back testing and analysis. Drive is a distraction especially if you are doing the turbos Day trade, only drive to make up losses. +400 or -100 a day My bf does that whole e coin trade stuff... Plus we both work part time for a local courier service.. mostly transporting medical such as blood / tissue samples from different hospitals.. or if a factory needs something shipped from different Warehouses in state.

My bf also teaches driving and gives long distance airport rides to the international college students. Lol he sorta does a lot, that or I'm more lazier than he is which is probably true ..

EDIT: Forgot to mention the routine..
Our routine is pretty laid back.. it's sorta on an on call basis for most of the work but we make decent money and have enough time to relax when we need it.. it's really flexible and we like it that way.  I'll share this post with him so he can talk about his e trading stuff. I manage google ads and facebook ads for clients. I code websites between rides and memorize scripts for acting jobs while I work. I have 3 films to prep for this fall and plenty of clients to build sites for. Sometimes I can completely code an entire website in a weekend while driving. Pink sheets right here I go to school and run a small social media company (I basically just take videos and photographs and manage ig’s of small companies), so I just end up doing homework or editing posts or something while I wait in between rides I sell Avon and do mystery shopping. Occasionally do freelance web dev.  Sometimes do school studies or work when it's slow.

It's all online, so almost everything is done on phone or ipad when parked. Mystery shop scheduling, web dev, and customer lead generation is done when I'm home while I knit.

I plan on starting to sell my knits and some crafts online in the coming months. Knitting is super portable, so that's always in the car- sometimes on the passenger seat if I want people to sit in the back seat :)

It's not really difficult to manage, as long as school work is prioritized...I actually find it easier to spin out discussion posts on the road without all the distractions at home, like pets, TVs, cat videos. I drive, but once I had my rig in the shop. I took a ride to the shop and the guy tried to sell me a mix cd. I've always used my limo and my ride share car to deliver my products at the same time I do driving.."
How often do you charge your phone while driving?,14,61.12143393951433,Lyft,Just wondering how often you guys charge your phone while driving for lyft. I try not keep my phone charging all day because I feel like that could be bad for the battery. I usually wait till it's down to about 60% then I'll charge it. I don't want to wait till it's 20% or lower because I feel like charging it for that long could overheat while also running lyft. Any suggestions?,"I use Carplay so mine is plugged in 100% of the time...unless a pax asks nicely for a charge and I'm feeling benevolent. Its true that you can extend the life of lithium-ion/lithium-poly batteries by maintaining and storing them at 60% charge. But if you're charging all the way to 100% the going back to 60% and then recharging again... you're not getting that benefit. For convenience, you're better off keeping it plugged into your car constantly. And make a habit of recharging when you have the opportunity, not just when your batt reaches a certain level.

Also, charging a battery from 0% (which is really about 30%, your phone just shows ""0%"") shouldn't overheat it in a cool car. Your phone has built-in protection from overheating anyways, so I would worry about it when you can look right at it.

One more thing: Fast charging (15-20w charger) is convenient and we all love it, BUT it can take years off the life of a battery. While it takes more time, slow charging (7.5-10w charger) is far better for battery longevity. Also unlike old NiCad batteries, lithium batteries benefit from shorter, more frequent charges, rather than longer charges after a ""full"" discharge. My Note8 battery drains with Uber/Lyft. I have to keep mine charging just to retain whatever percentage I have lol You really need to keep things simple. Keep it plugged in and charged/charging. You don’t need to be fiddling with your phone while doing Lyft/Uber. 

I use two devices. 1 for Uber/Lyft, 2nd for music / secondary nav when necessary. They stay charged up. 
I have another plug for pax, and only hand over when requested. Wireless charger for the win! 
Seriously, since I got that wireless charger in the car, live behind the wheel came much more easier. by the time you see any negative impacts on battery you'll probably want a new phone anyway. Modern phones are fine to leave on the charger. I keep mine plugged in."
"Some of you may already know this, but converting you bulbs to LEDs can save you some time and money. There are LEDs now that fit into traditional sockets and may never need replacement. I’ve not changed a bulb in over 2 years, the best part is that they don’t fade.",14,61.28749875432916,Lyft,Image,"A,if you do this, make sure it will not cause your car to think the bulb is out.

B, my car I got in 13. Not a single led on it. I’ve yet to need to replace a single bulb. Oh god please DONT do this. Don’t be that idiot with super bright LED bulbs in halogen bulb housings, blinding everyone. 

Also, these will make your turn signals go all wonky because the car will think the bulb is out since these use little energy. 

These will hardly save you anything, how much is a bulb nowadays like less than $10? 

LED bulbs do fade over time."
I NEED A PHONE # ASAP,23,62.16268393952537,Lyft,Someone PLEASE help me. I am a driver with express drive and lyft keeps sending me an email to take my car in for preventative maintenance (by Aug. 8th) . The problem is I took the car on August 5th already. Now I received an email saying the rental cannot be auto-renewed because I didn’t take it in (when I did). I contacted lyft with multiple emails and did not get a response. :(,"I’ll help you - return the car lol. Starting next week, Lyft is slashing driver pay to as low as 24 cents a mile. You will be paying Lyft to drive for them. 

That being said - if you want to talk to someone from Lyft just click the report an accident button. Lyft will call you back immediately and then you can just tell them you want to speak to someone from billing. Go into Hertz and have them fix it on their end. They probably didn't upload the invoice to Lyft. Bring a lunch, you'll probably be there for 2-4 hours They don’t have a phone number. Email employees directly Express drive?  You're either getting screwed or using the car as a home so you don't mind a free home in exchange for getting screwed lol Thank you all for taking the time, this is really giving me a headache. Hope your day goes better than mine. I havent taken a day off since July 4th you would think they would show a little more respect to us. I max out my time EVERY day. What a joke Contact the Lyft Express Drive reps. You should have their number. Tweet at the co-CEOS include the twitter handle for SEC enforcement and mention stock fraud and material info being hidden from investors.

And once your issue is resolved, remind the co-CEOs it shouldn’t require you publicly reporting them for stock fraud for them to be more responsive to drivers. If I had an @ name I would def consider this as an option"
Found a lost item,12,62.490716346932786,Lyft,Found a lost item but the passenger was really nice so I don’t want to charge them. If I report it to lyft will it automatically charge the passenger or does lyft pay out of pocket? I obviously am trying to return the item regardless but it would be nice if the pax didn’t have to pay. Any advice is appreciated,"You have to claim the lost item in the app and so does the PAX, Lyft will contact you about it and will either give you the PAX phone # or ask if it's ok to give yours. They will follow up afterwards and if you don't want to charge the PAX you can ask them to wave the fee - but if you're going out of your way to return it, $15 is not that much in terms of your time and gas. I’ve gotten notified the pax left an item and when I told Lyft I returned it I told them not to charge the $15 since they gave me $20 cash. To the best of my knowledge they were not charged. So just ask like the post above says and it should be fine. I would advise that if you’re going out of your way at all to go ahead and collect the $15 if they don’t tip you at least that much. :) Just message the pax and set up s meeting You must be new. You take the $15 return fee to make up for all the no tippers. Why you would want to pass it up just because someone was nice is beyond me."
Just got my first time out for cancelling too many rides.,22,62.552753383980864,Lyft,Gotta wait for 30 minutes before I can log back on. How many of these will I get before deactivation? Cause that's how I'm gonna flame out of this gig.,Fuck them you're an independent contractor but yet they're trying to control you like an employee I threatened arbitration They won't deactivate you. Don't accept the ride if you don't want it. You're just being a dick. Declining a ride is fine. Cancelling is a douche move. Lyft will be out of business in >365 days.
Is it still worth working for Lyft?,15,62.70951264324011,Lyft,"I know it is kinda stupid question. I worked for 2 years with food delivery apps and since I'm turning 21 I wonder if it's still worth the hassle. I don't care about wear and tear on the car, it's already have a lot of miles, still in good condition though, besides cracked windshield which I read won't go through and hand sized dent on quarter. Will windshield disqualify car from platform? Also, is it still worth doing in term of money? Or should I move on with something different. I appreciate all answers! Thanks!","Nope, I stopped driving  for Lyft a few weeks ago, no challenges, no bonuses, no streaks nothing! I do postmates and DoorDash now, making more driving less miles. And that worthless joke PPZ that replaced prime time just pushed me over the edge. Plus the fact that no one tips anymore. Done! It’s not worth it and you’re definitely not getting approved with a cracked windshield. No It really depends on your situation. For example, if you’re having to cover a car payment, insurance, gas, maintenance, registration, and the work required to upkeep your car to acceptable standards, and you’re having to make all that money off Lyft alone, no it’s not worth it. No. The rates they’re paying now, you are basically paying them to drive. Don’t do it. I do Lyft and Uber at the same time. I feel like I have to. Within a week of doing Lyft, ride rate was unpredictable. First day I’d get 12 rides, second day I’d get 3.

Gotta do both. I run deliveries for Uber as well.

It’s also a side job, not a main job. Driving doesn’t give you sustainable income to live off of. Depend on your area, would recommend fix the windshield then go for it. doesn’t hurt if you have rideshare plus food delivery if it’s slow or the opposite. If you’re in an area like LA or Seattle then it’s worth it, anywhere else then you gotta try it first Honestly just depends on your area. I drove full time for 5 months up until this week and was making $700-900 a week and I enjoyed doing it. I just do it part time now. I would ignore most of this sub, way too negative. Just try it out and see what you think."
Lyft is lowering their pay for drivers again - and insulting your intelligence by saying it’s better for you!,38,62.820878383980855,Lyft,Image,"$0.24 A MILE???? Fed write off is $0.58 a mile...so you technically LOSE $0.34 a mile?

Lmao wtf never thought it would get this bad- drivers are now literally PAYING (at least in the government’s eyes) for the privilege to drive their own car for Lyft. u/Lyft literally paying Vegas drivers NEGATIVE THIRTY-FOUR CENTS A MILE.

This is extremely illegal. Lyft is going to get shut down before they can even bring the robot cars to fruition... Lyft is lowering the pay of their express drivers from an already abysmal 39 cents per mile to a downright laughable 24 cents per mile.

But don’t worry, now they’re paying you 18 cents per minute instead of the 15 cents they used to pay. Remember, Lyft values your time as much as you do! Lmfao. If you drove 40 miles for an hour, you would make a whopping $21.30 on that ride. 24 cents a mile is a joke lol. Am I missing something here? I’m glad I got a full time job. Fuck Lyft and uber Whoa! This is fucked Jesus where do you drive?  $0.24/mile is just stupid.  That's so low it's like getting paid for time twice instead of actually getting a decent price/mile. If it costs me $15 for 150 miles of driving, I’d better be making $45-60 for that, if not more. Breaking even is just wasting gas and having unnecessary vehicle maintenance. oh my god, didnt know it could get worse.....wow. fuck... this is depressing to see.. i hope all the express drivers in Las Vegas will just return thier car and make a stance.. i did it when they lowered it to .39 cent not too long ago Is this net or gross, the math is so micro I cant even wrap my mind around the equation. So, you make $5 for every gallon of gas which costs $3.00. Leaving you with less than $2 for every 20 miles or so of driving. Im quitting Lyft if these numbers hit my market. Wow that's bullshit. I hate to be a Debbie Downer. Ahem so I was doing Lyft and I was working 36 hours a week at my full time. Now I'm a CNA so I'm used to deducting specific items that I bought for work and I kept the receipts for tax time. So I figured I'm going to do this for Lyft. Well apparently you can't do that anymore after the Trump's new tax law's. Such douche. There are some rules which state that you're not going to be able to deduct specific things for work, medical expenses and school expenses, etc. I was going to deduct expenses for driving for Lyft which I can no longer do. What kind shit is that!!!! Now I was pissed so now I'm just doing my full time. I was actually earning less at Lyft than my full time job. Mind you CNAS aren't paid alot of money but it have it pay more than Lyft then I'm glad that I stopped working for Lyft. And with this crap with them lowering your wage I'm glad I jumped ship. This is BS. I don't know what to say. Have you looked into driving for an airporter who has their own vehicles? Damn.  At that rate your paying Lyft to drive people around.  That's mathematical genius on Lyft's part! I'd just like to say, WTF. What area is this, because I get more per mile than this. Starting the 14th my market is starting power zones, yay... Not :/ Is that just for Vegas? For will it affect all driver? This is their M.O. Keep you unsure by making it as hard as possible to truly understand your bottom line. With every pay cut, completely restructure pay, that way you have no basis for comparison.

They keep doing this, and they can continue until their workforce is tapped out.

Rideshare was already a sham at q1 2019 rates. Good luck now. What a sham. 24c/mi is about the long run expense for operating a midsized sedan with a $2500 insurance deductible. You're taking home just pickup fees plus per minute. Which means you aren't self insuring that deductible.

Get out while you can. They're counting on you to drive at a loss and just fail to notice until you wash out. the only way this works is if they are moving to a model where drivers have to hit certain pickup and mileage driven on app numbers and their car is completely free.

&#x200B;

You would drive 1000 miles for 240 dollars and that does not even cover your car rental - these usually run 250 a week and up. I'm not going into the expres drive bonus because it's really not a bonus - it's a rebate on the 10 cents a mile they underpay you to begin with vs drivers who own their cars.

&#x200B;

If they are doing this to all their rental car drivers, it's the end of express drive. everyone will hand in their car - I can't help but wonder if that is the intent. They also recently raised the new driver car quality requirement in many cities. I think you have to now have a 2014/2015 or newer car in many cities.

&#x200B;

This will bring new driver signups to zero and enable them to increase net income (they are not reducing rates to pax obviously so they are now keeping 75-80% of the fare.

&#x200B;

I saw elsewhere on reddit Uber lost 5 BILLION this quarter so guess who is cutting their rates on august 15th if this happens and the drivers don't revolt? Wait is this only for express drivers or all drivers in your area ? My thoughts are if Lyft does this everywhere they can go fuck themselves. I'd rather deliver pizza again than deal with that bullshit."
"Thought I’d share- these are the same throw-up bags we use in the ER, if you didn’t already know about them. Thanks for all you do, drivers!!",29,63.05296171732799,Lyft,Image,"I +1 these!

You probably get them from medline tho :) I just always call these horse condoms thanks to my mother. Pax should bring the bags with them.

Self employment tax is 15.3%, which is a whole $5.81 of that $38.  And if you do your taxes smartly, you would've had expenses like the mileage deduction.  If you drove 22 miles or more (which I'm betting you did to earn that $38), then you can write off the mileage and effectively pay $0 in taxes.  But you still need to file the return so you don't get in trouble. Wow it was that bad that you quit after only making $38?! I guess I don't blame you although Uber is much worse. No, my buddy did 5 rides, quit, and never filed taxes. You have to make a certain amount of money in a 1099 job and I think it's $500 or around there.

Edit: looks like $600 according to the other posts. Nobody should pay taxes ever... Usually it is after$8 u need file taxes for You don't have to claim money from a 1099 type job unless you earn over 600 dollars in a tax season. Lyft isn't even required to make a 1099 and issues it to you or the IRS.  
So if that's literally all you made, then you don't need to claim it. Make less than 600 = do not need to file"

Did lyft just send out a bunch of complete your driver profile reminders to people or is someone trying to steal my info?,1,63.68643393956125,Lyft,"I registered but never finished in like 2017, I got an email and a text.

PAX who lie about tipping,28,63.823725606236195,Lyft,"This fat guy, super drunk, told me his wife put the wrong address and wants me to take him 10 mins down the road from what his wife put the address to. He was supposed to be arriving home. Told me he’d tip me $5 so in my head “$5 for 3 miles sure” get to the end of the trip, man did not tip me, just exited the car at the casino and walked away. 

So 5 mins later I park near the parking lot to maybe get a ride from the casino, try to look at the backseat to make sure everything was alright till I noticed the floor, $100 bill on the floor, new one too, I pick it up and drive home laughing that some Shithead pax got what he deserved for lying to me.","Man I wish I could find a fucking 10 dollar bill with the day I’ve had Hardly anyone ever tells me that they’re going to tip me and then actually tips me. I get tips, but the pax usually just says “Thanks for the ride,” or something equivalent. When someone says to me “Hey, I’ll tip you in the app,” they are usually lying, and I don’t get it. Are you trying to make me think you’re a nice guy? (It’s always guys.) Because in a few minutes, I’m not only going to think you’re a cheapskate, but I’m also going to think you’re a liar. A bald-faced, smiling liar. Honestly, when someone gets out of the car and doesn’t tip me, I don’t immediately think they’re cheap. Maybe they have other things on their mind. Maybe they don’t realize they should tip. But if you say, “Hey, man, I’ll tip you good,” then I know that you know. How weak is your self-esteem that you need to lie to a stranger to get them to think you’re cool for all of 30 seconds? I've had some pretty decent cash tips in the past, like a $5 tip on a $5 ride. Got a $10 tip for stopping at a driver thru and a couple of other $10 and $12 cash tips on short rides.   


BUT...   


If anyone ever says ""If you do X, I'll tip you"" then I always say ""OK, and stick my hand out for the tip. Guess what? They NEVER put anything in my hand, ever, so I never do ""X"" for them. i had a lady i dropped off at the airport. didn’t want her trip AT ALL. but didn’t have the heart to tell her i need to stick around downtown in case of a ppz. so i took her. dropped her off. “i’ll tip you on the app!” as she pointed at her phone. after a few hours, i said fuck this lady and rated her 3 stars. it was a $38 ride and i made $27. hours later, a $25 tip comes in. never judge! Fucking proper well done good job there mate, former lyft rep Wow. I love karma. Yeah I finally figured out how to sidestep those assholes. 

Lyft allows Pax to tip DURING the ride now (I don't think it's always been like that?), so when someone makes that kind of offer, tell them ""yeah sure, let's go ahead and open the app and take care of that, then we're off!""

So far I'm 70/30 people who do the tip/people who get pissy and get out (and then I send an immediate ""don't count this 1 star review cause it's bullshit"" email to support)

Granted, I think most of them forget cause they're drunk as shit, but plenty are lacking scruples. I had three drunk guys and a girl try to get me to drive an extra 20 miles to take their friend home for free and a promise of a “fat” tip. I laughed and said absolutely not. Anyone who says that they'll tip or who are super waisted don't typically tip, but for me I have a high tip to ride ratio. I told this girl yesterday that we see if you tip or not and she tipped me 10 so that was nice of her I've stopped tipping drivers because of my experience as a driver and this sub. Tipping culture needs to die anyway. So you guys rate people low for not tipping? That's petty as fuck, ya we make Jack shit off lyft but there is no law that says a passenger HAS to tip.  You rating someone low because they didn't tip makes you sound entitled as fuck"
Security said he was reporting me at airport I was unfamiliar with in a Lyft driver capacity.,8,63.918598291421375,Lyft,"I got a ride request about 5 minutes from my house to go to the major airport about an hour and a half away, which is an airport I frequently drive friends and family to, but not one that I've ever driven a passenger to. The last time I drove a family member was a couple months ago and I had forgotten to take my Lyft sticker off my car but had no problems. 

This time however, a security guard quickly flagged me down and said that I had to go to a different level. The passenger was running late, so I just pulled down a little bit, but the security guard came back and took pictures of my vehicle saying he was reporting me to ""Uber"" and that they would probably take my ""license"" away. 

Next time I'll definitely look at them Lyft map instead of going on autopilot, but I was wondering how valid his threats were.",Very valid if it's TRUE. You have to follow pick up locations at the airport...he can get a cop involved to give you a ticket as well. What airport were you at? Why are airport security/crossing guards such ass*oles??  People that are on a power trip make me want to bring them now a notch!
Streak question,3,63.96356356919915,Lyft,"So I have an afternoon streak of 10 dollars for 5 rides coming up in about an hour, does anyone know if accepting a ride via the airport queue counts as part of that streak?","Any 5 consecutive rides... do not cancel, do not shut off app... do 5 in a row, you get $10 Streaks that much arnt worth it. The first 2 will go well and then lyft will try to get you to go 10+ minutes for a third ride which will end up being a ride around the corner. Then when's that's done, they will ask you to go 15+ mins for another pax who wants to go around the corner from his house.

Streaks are a huge scam. I refuse to do any more than 3 in a rowe."
Getting a ride cancelled ping when rider is in my car?,30,63.988551995138884,Lyft,"Anyone else getting this? For the past two days when I am approaching my pick up and shortly after my ride starts, the app makes a sound as if the ride was cancelled even though it wasn’t. The navigation map goes to the idle map too, but after a couple seconds everything is back to normal as if nothing happened.  

I’ve restored my phone and reinstalled the app, still happens. I have an iPhone 6 so maybe the phone is just starting to die? Maybe that’ll give me more rides too as it seems I’m not getting much right now. Any ideas?","I kept getting this all night last night. Glad to know it wasn’t just me. It's been happening to me also.  Lyft support doesn't understand the problem and instead tells me that I shouldn't be worried about cancellation fees.  WTF? No Lyft, I'm worried about getting rear-ended at a PU location because the pax and I are both sitting, looking at our phones trying to figure out why the trip disappeared.  In the meantime, PLAYER 3 HAS ENTERED, and another driver shows up who also accepted the trip.  I seriously doubt it's the phone itself.  I do use an iPhone 6 and I also run the rider app in the background.  The rider app confirms that I have mysteriously disappeared with a rider in my car.  Here's the fun part: The rider app automatically PINGS another driver in this glitch but now the rider's location is in my car so even if I've driven a couple blocks then pulled into a parking lot, to sort out the trip, the new driver comes to me in the parking lot instead of the original PU address.  Happened multiple times in the last 2 weeks so I ditched the app once I got paid.  I've been an UBER driver for 3 years.  I've been a Lyft driver for 2 weeks. It’s not your phone or where you drive.  My Lyft app has been doing the same thing.... It’s been doing this to a lot of us, and it’s nationwide.

(I have an iPhone XR and I’m in Ohio) Had that yesterday afternoon and today as soon as I got close enough to click arrived. I have also had it a couple times where the ride disappeared and got “rider canceled” notification while passenger was still in the car. Clicked back on the Lyft Driver app,  the ride was still there as if nothing had happened. It happened to me, too, where the rider seemingly cancelled as I got close to the destination, and then just jumps back into it like it was never cancelled. Very weird. [deleted] Android user in San Francisco. 

The app has been buggy for me Monday and this morning. It didn't cancel but it took several tries to click the arrive and pickup buttons. Almost like I was in an area with bad cellphones service but I know I had service. its probably not the phone but you may want to upgrade quickly. My I6 started to die and my signal wasnt strong enough to process the app, nav, etc which led to a lot of cacelled rides because pax didnt see me coming to get them or i wasnt getting credit for some rides. I did however have a couple of savy pax that tried cancelling just as we started to pull away to get a free ride and let them know i couldnt take them. Definitely have to beware of scammers. Yup, same I'm on the beta app and have a fun similar bug where it constantly tells me someone has cancelled the ride, but I don't even have a ping yet.  So basically ""Linda cancelled the ride"" and I'm like...who the hell is Linda? That happened to me . Pax pissed off . She had to request other ride but this time with Uber. I do Uber too. Later on, I sent a message to lyft asking them don't do any charge to her. It has happened to me on every Lyft trip I have taken the past two days. I am running the latest iOS software on an iPhone X so I don’t believe it is because you have a 6. I have a Google Pixel 3a and it's happens at least 1-3 times a day. Always when the pick is extremely close. I don't understand why Definitely a bug Still happening Every time my app acts buggy I check the connection and sure enough - under Bluetooth it says (1 device is using this location) - it shouldn't say that, it should look like [this.](https://imgur.com/a/llJelXZ)

Please check your connection when this happens and see if it says that on yours?

My app doesn't cancel, but the wheel keeps spinning around and doesn't pick up or drop off sometimes - to fix it, I toggle Airplane mode on/off and reset Bluetooth off/on and it works again. Yes it happened to me also.Software bug. Yep, same story. Annoying

Airport que,4,64.82298486552028,Lyft,So there allways is around 20sh Lyft drivers at the Sacramento airport is it worth it to enter the que and wait to get a ride. Personally I'm not sure if waiting is worth it or not?,"Not worth it. 90% of SMF fares are going to downtown Sacramento, about a $7-9 fare once Lyft takes the lion's share and you've been waiting 60-120 minutes at least. I only ever wait if I drop someone off 🤷🏻‍♂️. It can pay off, but I never count on it. It really depends on how far your airport is from where most riders are going. If it's close to a downtown area then probably not. I've never entered the 'queue' before at my nearby airport.

Interestingly enough, about 50% of the time when I drive by it or drop someone off at the airport, I'll get a pick up from there regardless of the queue. Last night was my first time entering queue in the 8 months I’ve been driving. I think it really is only worth it if it’s a few minute wait, or a special time circumstance with bonuses involved. Tonight in Boston was incredible."

This has happened to me several times. You just gotta wait it out. Regardless of the obvious bug that is causing that prompt, what it *should* be prompting you with is something along the lines of asking you to confirm (or cancel) going offline once the current/previous ride is marked as completed. The app does some odd things sometimes, for sure. When you uninstall it, are you deleting the app's cache and user data, as well? Ive had it happen a few times. Usually I just gotta wait a minute and try again and it works. Switch to the riders app, start ordering a ride, cancel it - and you're done. That happened to me last night.

Never let a pax leave stuff in your vehicle as an anchor either! Just click ready to go, then drop off, your done. You can then rate the pax  3 or lower, this will prevent you from ever getting this pax again. Leave a comment in the rating if needed. Payout was 33.46 for an hour and 45. Said he would leave me “fat tip” which I didn’t see.... does a tip take awhile to show or did he screw me like I assume he did? Also, make sure they don't anchor you aka leave something in the car while they go shopping or whatever they are doing wasting your time.  Set expectations before they get out that you don't get paid for wait time and that you can only wait 5 mins.  After that, you're leaving and they can request another ride when they are ready. Just end it Uber’s wait time for stops is 3 minutes and the app tells the passenger this. I reiterate that it’s policy. Sounds like Lyft’s is 5 minutes. Reiterate to the pax that 5 minutes is the policy. Your per minute rate is peanuts.

Look at it this way: if your wheels aren’t turning with meat in the seat, you’re not making any money. Be selfish as soon as a pax steps outside of policy. drive around while you wait.. Tell pax that that is how
you make money.. Had the same issue the other day, couple went to Walmart most either wait 5 mins or just leave at the first stop. I left after 10 minutes but if it was a long ride there on a slow day then yeah I'd wait for them. Update - the guy actually tipped $20! I’m amazed!

## Running errands

We love seeing community members help each other out, so we see running errands as a great part of the Lyft experience.

When making multiple stops, keep in mind that drivers are just like you and may have other plans later in the day. If you’re making a stop or going to leave the car for more than 10 minutes, ask the driver to end the ride. Then, request a new ride when you’re ready to go to your next destination. Thanks everyone for the advice. Gonna meet my wife after, so I’m just gonna hang out I guess, would rather wait a little longer for a chance of a tip. Cancel and 1 star that peace of shit So I guess with the multiple stops thing, “the meter is running”. So I should be getting paid to wait yeah? Fat tip means his dick, and the best help you will get is if you stop driving Lyft and start with Uber."

"Using Lyft in the US with a ""Foreign"" Mobile?",18,66.1584594025932,Lyft,"Hi.  I'm coming to the US from Norway, with a Norwegian mobile - and last time in the US, tried to use Lyft, but no success.  I downloaded the app, but with my non-US number, couldn't complete the set-up.  And when I tried to use it via the web version ([m.lyft.com](https://m.lyft.com)) - also no luck.

I've been googling, trying to see if anyone has any information about whether there's some sort of workaround for this, but haven't had much luck.  Most people said it's just not possible - although a couple of sites (a bit shady, it seemed) suggested there are ways to get a ""virtual"" US phone number.  However, some of these appear to be only for SMS (text+, for example), and one person on one thread said she'd tried to use Lyft with Google Voice, and it didn't work.

Any way to get around this?  Or will I be stuck paying (literally) 3x as much for taxis?

Thanks!","Use the other rideshare app, or else get a prepaid mobile phone or Sim card when you get here. I'd recommend the first option Hi there, if you have a gmail account you can get a Google Voice number for free and use that to sign up for Lyft, hope that helps!
Edit: there is an app for google voice Just because Google voice didn't work out for someone else, doesn't mean it won't work for you. Alternatively, you can try ""visible"" mobile service app."
Lyft Vomit Fraud,11,66.173112180382,Lyft,"Went out for sister's bday to a club. Took a Lyft around 2:15 am and most everyone had been drinking. No one was crazy drunk, nor sick. Everyone was nice and well behaved. Got home and discovered in the morning I had $100 vomit charge. No one vomited in his van. He was probably angry it was a lower ride fare for a far distance at a prime time hour. I was sitting in the seat of question and was sober the whole night looking after my sister, so pretty sure I would remember vomiting on their floor.

I disputed it and got a return email 1 min later saying the charge is valid and they aren't taking the charge down. I filed a complaint with BBB and dispute with Amex already. I really don't care about the $100 at this point, it is the fact that without any due process they will just upload blatant fraud on the driver's part. I will be taking photos from here on out of every lyft/uber and will not be using lyft again.

Attached is the vomit in question, as you can see it looks fake, minimal and is on weather proof mats on the floor. No splatter from puking, it's all contained in one area which a drunk person would not care to do. I also asked for the original photos to see the location, phone, time metadata and never received a response. The photos they sent were stripped of all that data. I also left a lowly review of the driver and saved his information.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lvw75a1uxme31.jpg","I think I'm going to start taking pictures of the seat and floor every time I get out of a Lyft so that I'll have my own evidence.

Also: When I was a driver for Lyft, somebody puked on my backseat floor.  It was a small spot and I didn't notice it until the next day, because I didn't get out and check the backseat after every ride.  Therefore I couldn't be sure that it was the last pax of the night that did it; it could have been some earlier pax who did it and later pax didn't notice it.  SO, anyway, my point is that maybe the puke is real but the driver didn't know who did it and just picked y'all because you were the last ride or you seemed the drunkest or something like that. I mean, that looks like vomit to me. It might not be from your group, and maybe the driver attributed it to the wrong ride (and if he did, that's rough and im sorry) but someone definitely vomited in that car and I'd be pissed I only got $100 as the driver (standard before was $150). The fact that you were ""looking out"" for your sister tells me you knew she is capable of something like this. Not every person who vomits goes full blown exorcist, especially girls who often just cough up a little. Perhaps during your rowdy birthday group she was embarrassed and puked up a little on the floorboard and you didnt even notice it happen. Part of me thinks that maybe Lyft is messing up who gets charged what. I’ve been flagged for “violations” as a driver, when I hadn’t been driving for several days. I think it’s entirely possible for Lyft to accidentally assign a puke charge to the wrong rider. The BBB won’t do anything for you. I don't even know if that's puke.  Those car mats/bottom of the floor just look really dirty and gross TBH.  Either he's trying to fraud you, or possibly he didn't notice until the next month and had no idea which ride it was from, so he guessed and picked you, which was the wrong ride.  I'm surprised Lyft just straight shut you down.  But if you're going to dispute with Amex, that's cool, but you might not be able to ride with Lyft anymore unless you pay, but that doesn't sound like a problem for you, so go for it. Lyft uses the metadata on a photo to determine when and where the picture was taken, and they no longer accept screenshots.

And when there's a dispute, more often than not they side with the passenger."

It's funny how we say the good old days. We keep making less and less money.  I don't remember seeing this thing called inflation that was taught to us having a chart showing us wages going down.  30 years ago out of highschool I was telemarketing magazine subscriptions for $8/hr plus bonus.  Gas was 99 cents a gallon.  Had another telemarketing jobs for credit cards and was making $20 an hour for 30 hours a week.  Grossing $600 a week part time.  Anyone have a time machine I can use to get the hell out of here...  This is rediculous when you look back and they say we have a great economy.  We were complaining back then. They let you stay in the app for 24 hours? How long did you actually drive? wow, that's impressive. F How many hours were you on the “clock” vs giving actual rides."
GPS taking drivers to wrong side of my building g,20,66.86494088409675,Lyft,"So apparently the Lyft GPS is taking drivers to the side of my apartment building instead of the front. I have checked each time and confirmed the pin is set correctly, but it will still apparently tell them to turn into the side of my building (where the parking lot is) rather than the front (where people normally wait to be picked up). Is there any way to report this to Lyft, or alternatively to let drivers know in advance to pick me up in front of building in a way that won’t annoy them and that they’ll be able to see?

This does not happen all the time but it has happened several times recently.","You can add a pickup note to ease the process, or call the driver in advance. You can try manually moving the pin instead of entering the address. There's not much Lyft could do. GPS like Waze likes to direct to parking lots. You could add a note to the ride. Since I'm also a driver, when I do destination mode, I know the maps send drivers to my garage (which is an alleyway behind my house). Even if I'm dropping the pin to the front or just using my address, it does it every time. I had to use Uber last night as a passenger and just sent one quick text to the driver once my ride was confirmed telling the driver to not make the turn at xx street as indicated and go straight to the front of my house. Worked just fine. 

As a driver, one quick text giving me a head's up as to anything specific (i.e. gate code, house with the blue car in the driveway, I'm wearing a red Hawaiian shirt with blue ball cap (actual text I got at a baseball stadium pickup)) goes a long way. Have you tried moving to a new house? You could maybe, I dont know....meet them in the parking lot? Put the address across from your building and be ready to go when the driver gets there.   Like outside, waving as they pull up.  
Also, put a clear picture of your face in your profile. Text the driver before they arrive. Otherwise, it's hard for drivers to know where you'll be, especially at apartment complexes, so they just drive to the pin. If you know where they will be just walk to where you know they will be. Are those legs of yours painted on? Another moron who doesnot understand how gps works.

Rotten apples,21,66.96075106929574,Lyft,More and more people I know (including myself) got scammed using Lyft (cleaning fee scam). It’s a shame that a few crooked drivers give the rest a bad reputation. These crooks are the rotten apples that spoil the whole bunch and it doesn’t seem like Lyft is doing anything about it.,"As a driver I had a girl vomit inside my door, and another woman pee on my seat.  

The cleaning fee is there for a reason, and unfortunately there will ALWAYS be scum who abuse ANYTHING.  If it's not the cleaning fee, it's going to be something else.  

I'm surprised that you know multiple people who've experienced the same thing.   Lyft has  really cracked down on the habitual cleaning fee claims.  They require receipts, and are being stingy with the payouts. You know what else sucks? Having someone puke in your car on a Saturday night, Lyft sends you $92.xx and tells you to send them a receipt for the cleanup, having to call a 24hr mobile detailing service to clean it up for $200 and they take payments with Square. Lyft won't accept Square receipt because there's no address for a mobile business on it. Get business to print me a paper receipt with their number and address on it, send to Lyft. Lyft gives vague response about why they still don't accept it and won't be adjusting the cleaning fee you received which was $92.xx and not only are you out another $108 but also out of the money you would have made for the rest of Saturday night, you basically worked for free. Will I take that L? Nope, you will pay me. So now I'm going to wait for the perfect opportunity to fake a puke or two myself so I can get compensated whether they know it or not. You can't fuck with people's money and livelihood like that, big corporations can take the loss, but we cannot. It’s a 2 way street. Use Uber and you’ll see the same thing or call a taxi and pay 2 or 3 times as much. Care to explain details how this scam works or what we can do to avoid it?"

There are just too many ""I don't know"" answers, and everything's a short answer without any details. Basically we're not getting any smarter by asking anything here. Sometimes I wonder if people in the call center actually know what they're talking about? Recently I had an issue where I couldn't get into the Hollywood Bowl to pick up a passenger because the security guard wouldn't let me (or any Lyft drivers in.) I was told by support that because there is heavy traffic I should kindly call my passenger and ask them to change the pick-up address to a better spot. That isn't possible - passengers can't edit their pick-up address and someone working in the call center should know that basic information, shouldn't they? What was the most common call you’d receive? Are all the answers you give from a script? Or are you allowed to get real and give honest answers? How the hell do you call Lyft? Where was the call center located? The only ask me anything topic that every answer is “I don’t know” worst thread ever. 

I doubt you worked for Lyft When I get deactivated because I am reported for driving while under the influence of something which is false. They claim to investigate the incident and I'm reactivated 48 hours later. Is there really an investigation? What are the details of how this investigation is carried out? How much power did you have to let’s say a driver called in and his account was put on hold due to some complaint like maybe passengers complaining saying driver was drunk or car was unsafe?

What would a passenger have to do for you not to rate them 5 stars?,18,67.66333208783634,Lyft,,"No tip Passengers basically have to go out of their way to be an asshole for me to rate them poorly.

Out of 5000 rides I've only rated about 20 people less than 5 stars, sometimes it's just a 3 star so I don't match with them again, other times it's a 1 star and I actually file a report with Lyft/Uber. Not tip is the biggest one. I don't rate any passenger because they don't rate me :( lol If they tell me they're going to tip and then they don't tip, 1 star. If they pull me from miles away only go less than a mile while not being disabled or dealing with bad weather, it's 3 stars unless they tip. It takes a lot to piss me off as far as attitude and I've only given a handful of people in the five years I've been doing this a negative rating for attitude puking, being way too drunk, slamming my door If they stink it’s a 3 star rating at best. Or a shared ride for 3 blocks. Also 3 star at best. I don't give any rider 5 stars without tipping.

Good passenger... no tip? 4 stars. 2 stoppers always get 1 star from me, unless they cash tip. 

I don't ever want to get you again and I want other drivers to know that you're a money loser. I’ve only done it twice. First smelled awful, spent half the ride on the phone begging his mom to send him money, then asked me for cash. The second talked down to me the the entire trip and was very condescending. I don’t rate any passengers but I almost rated someone 1 star last night for the most obnoxious backseat driving. I had to hear about the “rideshare area” about 17 times (in broken English) before they got out. It’s not my fault the GPS brought me to the front door and not the “rideshare area”.

Baby as a Rider?,10,67.69550801377054,Lyft,"So, I'm new to Lyft as a driver and was on my 10th ride.  Pulled up, out came a woman, her mother and an infant in a baby carrier.

I don't have a car seat in my car.  They sat on either side of the carrier in the back for the 4 mile trip.

I should have rejected this ride, right?","A modern baby carrier should be able to be seat belted into the car. It should have two small slots where the lap belt can fit in. The carrier will be facing the back. Yes. some baby carriers double as car seats specially when the babies are under 40lbs.


So the answer is maybe. A good way to know for sure is if they put the seat belt around the carrier. They have specific loops and places where the seat belt goes and you can tell immediately it's made for it.

Hope this gives you some piece of mind.

If you see them on a ""kangaroo pouch"" then that's a big no no. As long as they bring the base of the carrier that gets belted onto the seat, it’s fine. A carrier alone has a curved bottom to enable it to be rocked and is very dangerous sitting on a seat unsecured and if that was the case you should have cancelled. You should be deactivated, for stupidity alone."
Lyft losing the trust of #DeleteUber women who thought it was 'woke',76,67.80268393969646,Lyft,Image,"It’s honestly disgusting how many stories I’ve heard from women as a driver. Most were too scared to report and thought the driver would know who reported them and remember where they lived/worked.

My own fiancée was assaulted by a Lyft driver, she was with a friend and even mentioned me being a driver. Didn’t stop him from grabbing her head and trying to kiss her at the end of the ride. 

Same reaction from her, she blamed herself and was worried he’d remember her and where he dropped her off and didn’t report immediately. She waited until the next day to tell me, and I made her report it, she got a call from a woman in San Francisco within 30 minutes informing her that she’d been refunded and the driver terminated. They wouldn’t go the extra step of reporting him to Uber though, so the scumbag is still out there able to find victims. I think all the time about a woman who passes out in his backseat... what happens to her?

This is a vetting issue. There’s far too low of a bar for rideshare drivers. Background checks are a good start, but face to face interviews, while not air-tight, would at least weed out some of the creeps and scumbags. Lmao! No company is woke. That was they're first mistake. I can’t believe that a single person fell for Lyft’s marketing. It’s mind boggling.

Ask a driver.

There’s zero difference between Lyft and Uber except that as a driver Lyft’s app is shittier.

Otherwise, the same, exact scummy business model. Let’s pretend to be a cutting edge tech company while we convince desperate drivers to rack up wear and tear on their own cars while making less than minimum wage. And if anything bad happens on those rides we’ll let poorly paid, customer service reps with zero psychological training on trauma try to talk sensitively with women who have just been sexually assaulted by a driver. 

And the execs will bathe in their riches and pat each other on the back for running a cutting-edge company. The delete uber was a joke. Did anyone really delete Uber? It still is worse to be a driver than it is to be a passenger, 10 to 1 margin, I guarantee it I recently fucked up an interview for an installation job because I really wanted to land it due to the benefits they offered .. needless to say I interviewed awkward af and I'm pretty sure I wont get called back lol ..  scary reading this post because the majority of rides I give are mostly women .. hope it doesn't affect my area.

Upcoming Lyft ToS restores binding arbitration for sexual assault?,4,68.07028810637692,Lyft,"Yesterday I got an email about the new [terms of service](https://www.lyft.com/terms/preview) going live near the end of this month. The headline mentioned changes to dispute resolution (read: arbitration) so red flags went off and I read through.

There are various changes throughout that I haven't fully processed. Claimants are no longer required to pay all the arbitration fees which is good, and Lyft no longer guarantees you may arbitrate solely through documentation/telephone for claims less than $10,000 which is bad.

The main thing that stood out to me is actually absent in both the old and new terms. **There is no exception to binding arbitration even in cases of sexual assault or sexual harassment.** As it says in the terms the new agreement supersedes any older one (should the 2018 public announcement even count as an ""agreement""), so this gives them the legal tool to continue using mandatory arbitration to silence these claims.

Recall it was May of last year when [Lyft announced scrapping mandatory arbitration in such cases](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-sexual-harassment/uber-lyft-scrap-mandatory-arbitration-for-sexual-assault-claims-idUSKCN1IG1I2). It appears that their PR team did this just to save face by matching Uber the day of that announcement. Apparently they were bluffing with knowledge that their lawyers would never actually approve it, but able to bank on the idea that still barely anyone reads these terms.

Addendum: Those who believe civil courts and arbitration have no relevance in combating sexual assault, take it up with the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/technology/uber-sex-misconduct.html), [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-ends-mandatory-arbitration-clauses-for-sexual-harassment-claims-1526378400), or [Uber](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/turning-the-lights-on/). IANAL.","[deleted] If the TOS never addressed Sexual Assault or Harassment the new terms don’t restore anything.

Lyft efficiency,5,68.11742931009167,Lyft,"This happens quite a bit so I thought I'd ask about it. I use ride share a lot and have always preferred lyft just because I drove for them when they first established in LV. Everyone I know, and more and more people I talk to prefer Uber. I think the reason why that is, it's definitely the reason I'm making the switch, is efficiency.
Tell me why they can't get the shared ride situation together? Uber has mastered it. Why, if my driver is on the freeway and we have passed the exit he needs for the next driver, it won't automatically cancel and ping a closer driver. Even if my driver is technically closer, he has to take a further exit, and drive all the way around, and anyone in Vegas traffic knows that's not always an quick, easy thing to do. It adds 20min to my ride, it makes the requested rider wait 20min instead of just getting them a new driver. If the rider cancels they are charged. I'm sorry but getting a ride is expensive enough, paying for one you don't get is unacceptable. 
Anyways, there is also always problems with the GPS and I'm sure drivers get the brunt of it with low ratings and less tips. They are losing customers and drivers to uber, they need to get it together.","Lyft doesnt have a Long Distance Pick up reimbursement. Lyft still thinks a call is necessary for a no show fee and has went out of its way to make that shit annoying difficult to get. That includes preventing us from hitting arrive until a few feet from the customers. Lyft still doesn’t have Dark Mode for its app. Lyft still doesn’t have in app texting or data call for many of us that use a Hotspot or use CarPlay. The rating system still sides with passengers, leaving us with a ridiculous amount of average time spent per passenger. In an 8 hour shift you can easily lose about half hour to an hour just waiting on Lyfts passengers. Lyft rarely gets corporate business because as you’ve made clear, drivers spent way too much time doing things other than drive. Then there’s the constant and annoying undercutting of rates/surges/ to compete with Uber leading riders to believe there’s always a cheaper ride somewhere. Now all rides are so fucking cheap that no ones making money. So, yeah - LYFT sucks man. It’s all I do everyday is 1 Star my way through to filter out the bullshit. Exactly. Shared rides should be for people traveling distances longer than say 5 miles. No one is profiting from a passenger taking a shared ride 1 mile.   


Shared rides should be from the hours of 5am to 7pm. Again, no one profits from a shared ride in the middle of the night.   


Shared rides should not be allowed to/from the airport or major events. If you can afford a plane ticket you can afford to pay full price for a Lyft.   


Shared rides should require no more than X deviation from the initial route (say 1/4 mile or 2 minutes in total)."

Even if your settings were XL only you probably would’ve just been sitting there not making money. Are you approved to drive for Uber? I know Uber allows you to toggle which ride requests you'll see. You can disable the UberX/Pool and just enable XL. Your vehicle does not have to be a luxury vehicle to be XL, all you need is a vehicle that is designed to seat 6-8 people including driver. I have seen Dodge Caravans on XL. I drive XL only and get anywhere from 4-6 hits a night. I usually turn my app on around 6:00 pm if there is a Braves home game to get the stadium rides. I don’t leave my house until I get a ride. If I don’t get one I’ll drive down to the stadium around the 6th inning. I will not accept a ride after the 7th inning. I will not turn on my Lyft app if Uber is surging. That box shit is garbage. Once I’ve gotten a pax from the stadium, I start heading to the bars and clubs. Usually by 1 am I’m up $150-200. I go grab some food at the taco place then head back to the bars and clubs around 2am. Last ride usually at 3:30am and I’m home by 4:30-5am with about $275-350.

You have an app on your phone that lets you get a ride in exchange for money.

Lyft/Uber own a server that matches clients and subcontractors. Each ride is a subcontract threw Lyft/Uber. passengers are Lyft/Uber clients and i am a subcontractor.

Lyft/Uber takes far too much money for their role in what they do (matching subcontractors and clients) between the two parties involved. They should be legally capped at 20% or less. IMO they should get no more than 10%. They offer little more than an app that matches two people together and processes payment.

Uber/Lyft drivers are background checked and we are all independent of uber and lyft. We arent criminals, proven, and we arent the tech giants who you feel are screwing you over...

I hate this driver vs passenger type thing im seeing in the media. I am absolutely positive both companies believe that if they create a divide between drivers and passengers then they would be able to shift frustrations off of them onto the other parties and would be in a better position to take larger amounts of money from both the passenger and the driver.

To them, its all about what a passenger is willing to pay, and how much a driver is willing to give up. You cannot forget that. 

They are trying to make us enemies when we are on the same team. Ebay, offerup, craigslist, match, okcupid, usedbikes, ect ect.... Every single one of these websites or apps offer a service that matches people with common interests and goals. NONE of them get away with taking as large of a total cost % as Lyft and Uber do. These companies are operating in a criminal manner, in my opinion. They cannot justify the need for such large profit margins when at the end of the year they keep losing money anyways and we all know its from over zealus marketing and poorly strategized bonus incentives (i loved those easy bonuses as a driver but do u guys remember the 500$ for 70 rides a week thing?

Anyone go through anything similar?,42,68.66840153233872,Lyft,"Incredibly drunk pax began screaming at his female companion after I picked them up in DTLA last night.  I told him not to be disrespectful in my car.  He told me he wanted to get out, so I pulled over.  As he was getting out, he spat in my face.  The female he was with did nothing.   They got another lyft (on her account) and sped off.  
I called the police and reported him (misdemeanor battery charge), and Lyft support told me they would cooperate with police and that they had removed him from the platform.  
I am just curious if anyone has gone through anything similar and if they got any resolution with getting a violent pax charged.  
My new dashcam arrives tomorrow.","Good for calling the police and following through. It’s surprising the physical violence and abuse some drivers will endure and never call the cops. 

I know all the police stations in my area. If a passenger gets out of line, I just deliver them to the police station. Saves them a ride in a patrol car. You did the right thing, not only in standing up for his companion, but for yourself and other Lyft drivers. Thanks! I only come to this sub now to laugh at some of the most retarded comments on reddit. I swear this place is worse than what r/incels used to be.

OP, good on you. Fuck that dude. what evidence did they collect? These comments are just...wew Nope because i never pick up incredible people drunk i never called police but ive had pax who became extremely vervally abusive and others who wanted to fight. So glad i dont have to deal with that anymore. Tried to involve  Lyft and police when a potential pax was offerinv me sexual favors via text. Lyft did nothing Had a similar situation, pick up drunk couple, couple get in a shouting match.  Guy starts hitting girl with a broom handle (they were in Mardi gras costumes, I guess guy had a broom handle for whatever reason) I grab handle and throw it out.  Guy tells me to stop the car, gets out staggers off.  Girl tells me that 'Pax is fine, and will wonder home eventually'.  I drop girl home, then she (swear to god) ask me inside. I politely decline.  Ahh, Mardi Gras. [removed] Next time mind ur business If people are able to run away but instead they stick together and fight, it’s because they want to fight. If you get involved, they’ll be more than happy to team up and fight you instead. Take me in the front butt."
"To you, what would FAIR pay from Lyft looks like as a driver?",18,68.98225569901643,Lyft,"Just an Open question, I am legitimately curious, at what point/%/$ would you feel Lyft is paying you a fair rate that would make you say ""Working with/for Lyft is great""","Id say a minimum ride $5 to start. No one should be able to get in my car for a ride without me getting a fiver at least. Of course, I'd want more than this, but the *bare minimum* for what I would consider ""fair"" would be-- 

$5 minimum fare  
$.80 mile for all miles driven from ping acceptance until passenger dropoff  
+ $.25 per minute during that time  
+ fuel surcharge adjusted weekly (average price of fuel/gallon in market divided by 30 mpg) paid per mile-- so $3/gallon would be $.10/mile   
$2/extra stop  
$.50/minute at stops  
$5 cancellation fee + time and miles driven to attempt pickup Keep the rates the same, but bring back Power Driver Bonus that paid us back a percentage of the cut Lyft gets for busting our chops. I use to average $200-$500 in Bonus back in the day, that made up for all the minimum rides, the go go grandparent stop, the Taco Bell multi stops. It all didn’t matter then cuz you knew at the end of the week you had that to look forward to. $7 minimum ride, $0.70/mile, $0.50/minute, $0.20/mile traveled, and I want my oil changes covered Have you seen taxi rate cards? Taxi rates. What I make currently lol I just got an estimate of $6 to $8 for going one mile in my small city.  What kind of rides are you getting that you think you need a minimum $5 fare?"
Lyft is copycatting Uber with new rewards program thinking we give a fuck about points and crap. We only want primetime and increased earnings Lyft.,35,69.01359829160903,Lyft,Image,"Yeah, I saw that.

No I didn’t. I asked for more pay. Nothing new.  I love how they take shit away with absolutely zero accountability nor intention of replacing it with something better or equal. 

And I still don’t understand why.  Sure they don’t give a shit, whatever, but that doesn’t account for the straight onslaught of attacks.  It’s like they are trying to purposely hurt drivers. Nobody asked for more/improved rewards, Lyft. Are you so dense and careless with your contractors? You are nothing without us. Get rid of that shared shit. What a confusing disaster. Fuck Lyft. I now make more on Uber in 1 hour than riding Lyft all around town for 3 hours. Keep your rewards Lyft, shove it back where it came form. Pay us what we deserve like what Uber is doing these days. 2% cash back on gas... who gives a fuck about 2% back on gas? How about they pay us and treat us like employees instead of independent contractors WE WANT MONEY TO SURVIVE. Fuck it, I'll just work at a gas station.

And now something tells me, that there won't be ANYTHING. Can someone please tell me where a Shell gas station is located??? Because that's the main one I can't find. I think the nearest Shell gas Station near is at least 10 miles. That's a long way to go get gas. I also thought that Lyft or maybe it was Uber who had this Debit Card thing. The shell discount is a joke! They’re way overpriced that any other gas station and to only save 5 cents is laughable. These are just corporate business expenses disguised as perks if the job."

An unexpected fee for literally no reason,29,69.65358671755979,Lyft,"So about two days ago I decided to Lyft to work from my house and you know I got there and nothing out of the ordinary. I'm respectful towards when it comes to peoples personal vehicle. But then later that night I went on my back account and noticed that I was charged twice. Once for the Fair itself which was $7.46. and another fee a damaged fee. A solid $100. When I contacted support they sent me images of what had happened to the vehicle and the ""damage"" that I had done. Which made me curios as to what it was because it's not like I dragged in feces or mud or any kind of that into this person's car. So I see the images they sent me and they literally look like they were either leafs of something that was easily put there for convince. I'm not saying my shoes are 100% clean most of the time but it's literally almost impossible to drag something with them because I could've noticed it. Granted this happened in the morning. But still like I'm pretty sure I've would've noticed it. You know I could probably understand probably like a small fee or something like that for that but it seems like it's literally something so small that could easily be out it's not like it was smudged or anything but it literally looks like a leaf. I'm not sure if the support team even looks at the photos at this point because that doesn't look like it's anything dirt, mud or such. And I've been trying to contact them for almost two full days now. But they literally seem like the have a bot responding to their mail. And I can't get anywhere with this.","The more Lyft and Uber are put to the squeeze from the investors wanting their money back, the more Uber and Lyft fuck the drivers (instead of say, not spending money like complete retards or maybe not paying outrageous salaries for board members).

Shittier drivers, less satisfied customers, less business, less pay for drivers > shittier drivers, less satisfied customers.......

Expect your experience as a passenger to get worse, and as a driver expect to be paid less. It's the only way these companies can keep going for now. They don't care long term, the upper echelons have gotten paid and have their $70 million dollar mansions, the investors get what they can, and the rest of us can just get fucked. such a scam. As a driver, in a million years would i never consider doing something this shitty. Fight fight fight.... Dispute the charge with your credit card company. You know how you take a photo of a scooter after you park it to show it's parked where it's supposed to be and is in 1 piece? Good idea to do the same after you ride. Snap a photo, protect yourself and your up to $250! This just happened to my wife and her 74-year old mom. After my wife disputed the $100 charge, the driver reported another $150 dollars in damage. The damage pictures appeared to be in the trunk of the car; the driver put the bags in and out of the car. Her detailed emails back to a Lyft only resulted in them saying the charges will still be applied. There is literally no recourse from them for this flat-out theft of $250. So pissed right now. Can you share the pictures? Id charge a fee too if it was feces, that's hazard pay for cleaning it. Quit bitching or quit using Uber. We aren't taxis or busses, respect the damn vehicle.

What is the process to open arbitration as a driver?,6,69.99592468054483,Lyft,"I was deactivated several months ago after they claimed I failed a routine background check.

I messaged support notify them I’m planning on opening a case and they responded with a ludicrous statement telling me I can be reactivated if I provide court documents saying my record has been expunged... even though there’s nothing to expunge. 

Do I need to contact the American Arbitration Association directly to do this since Lyft doesn’t seem to be of any help?

Thanks!","Talking to a lawyer will be your best bet if you’re serious about it. What you should do at first is request your background check report copy.

Section 3 added age requirements for bike-share and scooter-share.

Section 4, under ""Facilitation of Charges"" added "" Lyft may group multiple charges into a single aggregate transaction on your payment method based on the date(s) they were incurred. If you don't recognize a transaction, then check your ride receipts and payment history.""

Section 8 changed quite a bit, too much to add here.

Section 9 added a restricted activity ""violate any of the Referral Program rules if you participate in the Referral Program"".

Section 10 added more info about the service animal policy as well as a wheelchair policy.

Section 11 added info about the Lyft amp and rules regarding what you can do with it. ""You agree you will not rent, lease, lend, sell, or otherwise redistribute the Lyft driver amp, or manufacture, produce, print, sell, distribute, purchase, or display counterfeit/inauthentic Lyft driver amps or other Lyft Marks"".

Section 18 added info about HIPPA since Lyft is now doing medical rides.

Am I the only one who has to stay in constant motion to get requests?,21,70.16821634723357,Lyft,"I’m trying to see if it’s an issue possibly with my mobile carrier. I recently switched and it doesn’t matter where I am, I don’t get requests while parked. I have to move around which as you know can be expensive on fuel.","I've scientifically verified, even using control scenarios, with different phone models, logging everything with an advanced spreadsheet of formulas for a a period of 1 year with 3500 trips and came to one conclusion.  In order to be sure you get the most trip requests, you Must be inside of a drive thru line waiting for food. You'd need a complete understanding of Lyft dispatch algorithms before you could answer this question. Anyone out there that's worked on the mechanics under the hood and not bound by an NDA? I have noticed something similar. I will get an occasional request while stopped, but it seems to me that I receive requests with more frequency when I'm moving. Could it be because while I'm moving, Lyft takes my rate of speed into consideration when determining how long it will take you to arrive at a passenger? I turn it on while I am home and never have a problem. I started thinking the same thing; but I attempted an experiment: I turned on the app from home, (I am just outside of the town border limits).  I often get pings to go drive.  
So, it killed my theory that I  have to be driving.  

I have also found that when I am on the phone I  get pings more often than when I am not.

My guess, is when driving and or on the phone I am more distracted than when I am just sitting and waiting on just that one thing a ping. u/uwutranslator I notice that more so when I'm driving in the city. Building mess with my gps so if I dont move, the GPS will start going all over the place, giving me calls that are out of the way, or none at all. Nope. Too busy here for that to matter. For me, it's different almost every day. Some days it seems like the moment I get to a place I want to hang at, I get a ping, and some days it seems like the more I drive, the busier I am. And then there are days where neither strategy works and I hang it up and wait for the next busy hour. There are areas with more requests demands withing some schedules. Train and buses terminals, theatres and so on. I think when you are in motion either in ride or not you are closer to the person requesting. In my area. We've found places where you will get more rides then in other spots F lyft they are worst than uber What's worse is moving because you have to use the bathroom and both Lyft and Uber ping your at the same damn time and after you pee you go back to nothing.  WTF?!? I’m usually driving around because I can never seem to get rides staying parked. Have literally stayed parked in a hot spot for almost an hour with nothing, hot something within 5 minutes of moving around after that. Sucks that it takes away gas but I guess $$ is $$"
Pax sent me ping from a bus stop in an intersection where there is no place to pull over and transit police will give ticket if I pull into Bus pick-up. Do pax ever use common sense and walk to a side street for easy safe pickup?,49,70.6413413472446,Lyft,Image,"My all-time favorite was a guy who was waiting for me next to a bus stop... Directly under a sign that said ""No Rideshare pickups.""

  


Bruh. 😕 I've canceled on people who I could see and they could see me if they refused to move to a safe pick up point. I swear pax pick the worst possible spots to be picked up at. I love when you get to pick up spot and they are across the street and they make you pull some sketchy U turn when they could've easily just crossed the street when you were on the way. I pull into a safe driveway/parking lot/side street and wait for them to come over. If they don't, that's an easy cancel. I had to go around corner and call them to let them know I can't pickup from where they are and I guided them to walk to where I was. The first passenger I kicked out was this guy named Assad, this happened one weekend afternoon, he puts his pickup to a closed office building on this road that was atop a small hill, I get to the ping see nothing, then stupidly search for him went back down the hill and saw him and his gf standing on a 4 lane road next to the sidewalk way opposite of me waving his hand, I drive about 500 feet make a u-turn, since there was no traffic, I get to them and they could easily get in since no cars where anywhere but the guy pointed me to go drive to a business that was along a little shopping area that was about 40 feet away. 

I pull into the shopping area say hello, and the first thing Assad says is that I should always pull over to a safe area when picking people up, I saw his gf kind of nudge him and I asked him to repeat himself cause I really wasn’t sure he really said that, He repeated himself, and I told them to kindly get out because I didn’t feel comfortable giving them a ride, I also told him to be at the right pickup next time and choose his pickup area better, they got out thankfully and I canceled the trip, not my fault you’re an idiot an can’t properly put in an address that you can reliably get to and be picked up and get mad when the spot you’re at is not up to your safety standards.

I learn a few lessons that day, stay at the pin if they aren’t visible and aren’t communicating, always choose a safe spot regardless of where they want to be picked up, and to not take any passengers bs. Nope. Pax aren't taught good pick-up locations. It seems as though it's on drivers to educate them. Whenever someone does that I park nearby and call them and explain. I had a pax at a pick up spot where they had the road closed for construction. I couldn’t get them at the spot so they had to walk up and they rated me 1 star because I didn’t pick them up at their spot. I drive in Las Vegas. Had a guy call me and tell me ""I'm standing in front of the Bellagio fountains wearing a blue shirt""   


For those unfamiliar, the Bellagio fountains are on the Las Vegas Strip, you can not legally stop and pick anyone up at any time. The fountains are approximately 2 city blocks long (almost half a mile) and there are typically several hundred to several thousand people on the side walk. Go to pin, wait 5 min, call pax and say hi, collect $5 no show fee, move on...... > do pax ever use common sense...

No. End of story.

Youre their rent-a-bitch, if you cant read their mind, it your fault. One star. In Madison we pull into bus stops all the time, we really shouldn't but we do. I don't stay there long though, if they aren't at the curb I leave. No they don't. They just get that pissy faced look and want you to come to them. Prius drivers will stop in the fast lane the uturn lane or just double park. I guess they are exempt from the regs No they don’t 👿 I have never had a passenger give me grief for making them walk. Just park where you want and if you cant spot them making progress send a text with your location. Nope. You're not being fully transparent here. You could have pulled into the apartment complex right next to the Pheonix Theater. There is almost zero chance transit police or a bus would roll up on you if you pulled into the bus spot, and if you just kept your eye on year rearview you could have moved if you saw the bus coming down Hennepin. Something similar last night.  Pax uses pin to give address, I drive to pin, she calls and says:  that's the back of the building.  I answer by:  it's where the pin is at, this is a building address of 4100.  I drive around to the front and she says:  can you read, it says 4100.  I say:  yes, the building address is 4100, you are on suite 100.  How about you send a note with Suite 100 or your suite restaurant name.  I am running out of magical dust to figure out where pax's are.  And let alone she sits inside her restaurant because it's too hot outside.  I was looking for them seconds to count down to cancel on her so bad.  And then for the typical, no tip either.  Hate dealing with the local crowd; that's why I rather go to the airport, theme parks or convention area.  At least they DO walk up to you as they are afraid you'll leave without them."

You guys got any tips?","Heroin and Grey Goose, cleverly disguised in my “water” bottle. No constantly driving.  You should find a spot to post up at in between rides.  Every mile you go without a ride, eats into your profit margin.  

Besides that, I have an rc car I run while in between rides.   I'll bring a book,  or crochet.   Idle hands make for a slow passage of time.  Keep them and your mind busy and you won't feel so disconnected.  

Books on tape are great. Maybe take a few college courses and use your down time to study.  

Just don't drive around aimlessly. Podcasts! , I became a fan of the daily, pod saves america and a few others. It helps you learn topics and keeps you engaged. Also, dont drive all the time, park in a spot and get out of the car, turn on the volume on your phone and do some squats or leg stretches. all of this i know is not a permament solution but it helps Hourly wank breaks.

Think of the alternative, sitting in an office cubicle and listening to the droning until youre permitted to leave at 5pm only to sit in traffic, go home, and do it again for 8hours tomorrow. I amuse myself by taking breaks to test-drive new cars, checking out sights that I normally wouldn't think twice about, finding hot-spots for date night with the wife...Oh, and if you're going to save your back, I recommend investing in one of those ~$7 lower back cushions from an auto parts store.

"Excuse me Lyft, what the heck?! :D The bad thing about this ride was that there were couple of drunks going to downtown Denver and they never showed up after I called them.

Why would you wait longer than 5 mins for a pickup? You got paid $5 for almost 40 mins of your time. That's a crappy consolation prize, not a win. If my passenger is not at the pickup in 5 mins, I'm gone. With or without my cancellation fee. The only exceptions are when they communicate clearly that there is a holdup and they will be out asap. This does not apply if they are noticeably drunk. If you wait then, at least there is a chance of them tipping since you didn't leave. Looks like this was a pool ride too. You should cancel as soon as the timer is up. You are wasting your time otherwise. Pro tip, if the ride is far away, I usually call the customer and say ""hey just wanted to verify this is your pickup, it's far away so I just wanted to make sure it's correct"" to make sure you can get in touch with them, see if they're heavily intoxicated, and that they're willing to communicate. If they dont pick up I just cancel, if they sound drunk or can't communicate I cancel. What in the--

"New to this. I have a FL Driver License, under parents' insurance/ 2014 car registered in NY - have some questions. Lyft support has been unresponsive.",11,71.14210523614453,Lyft,"Hi all,

Background: 24, Florida DL, drive & insured in NY (with parents' car). Can't register in Florida because car has to be newer than 2017. My situation is it seems like I cannot sign up in Florida, New York, or California. I cannot change my driver license from Florida to elsewhere for instate tuition purposes. I read about the ability in Lyft to work in a different region over the region you signed up in - so I am wondering if that is a legitimate loophole.

**\*\*tl;dr What is the best way for me to be able to drive for Lyft in California as an out of stater?\*\*** Should I sign up for Lyft in a state that allows out of state license plates (like New Jersey) and then drive all the way to California? Would Lyft even allow this for extended periods of time if at all?

Thanks in advance.

Can you use Lat Long coordinates as Rider?,8,71.22420014356574,Lyft,"I am a job coach supporting an individual with a developmental disability. He has used lyft to get to and from work reliably in the past. He started a new job and the new location is in a very large business park where the single address directs to a location far from his employee access entrance to the building. I know that he can move the location to match his blue gps spot with the pickup location, but this has been a difficult concept to learn. While I work on other interventions, I am trying to see if the app has functionality to accept a specific Latitude Longitude as a set pick up location so he can have less potential for error in future pickups. Any guidance is appreciated.","You can set a pin on the map instead of entering an address. OK, put your phone in your pocket. Do you see any pin? What pin?

Now go to the entrance of the building. See any names? Signposts? Street? Building name or number? Distinctive color scheme? You can send a canned message to the driver with any of these.

It doesn't matter if you give the driver the exact earth coordinates. GPS can be off. Pinpoint accuracy is an illusion. As the last resort, people try and error dropping pins. And pick the one that leads the driver closest to the destination. No. Just send an in app message saying employee entrance please. If the driver can't figure that out you don't want that driver anyways I know that Google Maps can accept coordinates, so I don’t see why Lyft wouldn’t be able to use it since Google is integrated into the GPS navigation."

Bipolar Driver,9,71.87069319914336,Lyft,My son is a Lyft driver. He is bipolar and doesn't take his meds. I don't think he should be driving. What do you think?,"Perfect match for some riders. I know 2 people closely that are diagnosed bipolar. That diagnosis ALWAYS requires treatment, and USUALLY includes medication. He may be fine now but the odds are if he isn’t treating his illness it may not be safe for him to drive, for his own sake and for his passengers. I would notify the company. There may not be anything they can do unless he’s committed a crime, but it’d be prudent to tell them. 

The point is not to stigmatize persons with mental illness—most of us are fine when we are treated. But to think it’s no biggie for someone with BPD to go off their meds is a mistake!

I’m not a doctor but I’m knowledgeable on this topic, you can PM me if you like. I think your right.  You should keep him in the basement with a PS4.

Here are some of the reasons why I think Lyft is worse than Uber. Do you agree?,61,72.04805431025449,Lyft,Image,"Two more reasons:  
1. Lyft (market-dependent) tends to have longer pickup distances and does not pay long pickup fees.  
2. Lyft will auto-magically switch rides on the driver if the algorithm determines another driver is closer, preventing you from being able to screen the new ride and often forcing the driver to go in the opposite direction of the first ride. And don't say ""Oh, that's just the algorithm."" Bullshit. Algorithms are designed by people. Lyft does this on purpose whereas I have never had Uber switch rides on me on the way to pickup. I've brought it up multiple times here: The PPZ is such a blatant slap to the face. 
Great post. 


OP forgot about the HUGE bait-and-switch back in 2016 where they said they were going to withhold old PDB % from you unless you upgraded your car to 2011 or newer. Then for some drivers, it was gone 9 months later, and for all drivers gone 18 months later. Not to mention many drivers had to work seven days for PDB, which is a Department of Labor federal violation. 

Whoops! Scumbag company. Taking Lyft to small claims court for refusing to pay for a ride after weeks of emailing and someone mentioned that Uber has a 24/7 support number reachable made me really regret choosing to drive for Lyft over Uber Lyft hides passenger ratings except for the 15 seconds where you accept the ride. An obvious attempt alleviate cancellations due to low ratings. Exactly the reason why I cancel. This sucks badly.

Lyft attempts to copy Uber by allowing us to see how far & in which direction are passenger is going but you need to keep a 90% acceptance rate ......but you would never do that if you saw exactly where you were going cuz it wouldn't be worth it. It's a load of bull shit. You’re totally right! Both of them are shitty companies nowadays, but Lyft is considerably worst than Uber. Regarding $2,500 deductible. The national average miles driven per accident is one in 15,000 miles.


So if you are fronting that $2,500 deductible, you better treat it the way a self-insuring business would: to be truly prepared, sock away double your expected liability per mile until you have the deductible on hand.

Looking at financial impact per event figures from Arizona DPS, and assuming that somewhere around 40% are at fault (due to some accidents involving more than 2 vehicles) that would mean putting away around $0.05 per mile driven (about 7 cents per mile on-trip) until you have $2,500 in a bank account that you will never touch for any other purpose.

But let's be honest. You won't be finding $2,500 spare from your meager Lyft income, even if you do drive 15000 mi under insurance periods 1 and 2.

Now let's talk about traffic tickets....

The summary is, at current rates rideshare is a sham in *most* markets. Why are you mentioning lyft's deductible? Your rideshare insurance will cover accidents.

You're playing with fire if you don't have rideshare insurance because even though lyft claims up to $1M/passenger that doesn't mean they will cover you in the event of a wreck. You don't have an insurance policy with lyft. They have a third party insurance agency that covers drivers but you're not the person signing that insurance policy and if they deny you then you can't do much about it other then sue lyft and good luck with that if you haven't opted out of arbitration.

If they for any reason deny a passenger claim (injury, whatever) then that pax isn't going after lyft they're going to go after you and your personal insurance. Personal insurance won't cover it and will drop you like a stone and then the passenger will go after you directly.

tl;dr new drivers and existing drivers think they don't need rideshare or commercial insurance and they really do. And they still paint themselves as the ""friendly"" company Sheesh. Just another reason to NOT work for either company. It's not worth it. This is how companies become reach by exploiting their work force. Personally I believe that either company is about the same with how horrible it is to work with them So I am in a weird area of things, I'm in the Eastern side of the US where there isn't PPZ, there is still prime time. Not everyday, pretty much always on the weekends or when there's nobody at the airport. But I do have to keep my acceptance rate high for the expected trip times, my way around this is to either close out the app immediately or to accept and ignore til the pax cancel. This keeps the acceptance rating untouched for the most part. I usually keep Uber on while I wait for the cancellation. I know that with an accident “Lyft’s insurance comes first” but with that premium I honestly wouldn’t report it to Lyft. I’d prefer my insurance to pay with $1000 premium than than the stupid $2500 Very well designed PSA, and absolutely spot on with the details. I specifically state these things (when it's an uber ride) when pax quiz me about which app is ""better"". Good job. I almost want to print this and hang it in my back seat. Fuck u/Lyft- worst company ever. Burn burn burn How does Lyft manipulate passengers’ ratings to ensure they’re all five stars? Seems to me if even one driver rates the passenger one star, it’s virtually impossible for them to get a 5.0 whether that one star rating is justified or not. The highest average they could possibly have on their last 100 trips is 4.96, which would round to 5.0, but that assumes all 99 other drivers gave them five stars. And yes, I know five is the default under lyft, but if they were that bad a passenger (and the one 1-star wasn’t an isolated incident) then surely that wouldn’t happen. Not to mention many lyft passengers haven’t taken 100 trips yet. If you use it twice a weekend, once each way, you’d need to be on the app a whole year to get 100 trips. And many don’t even use it that much. If anything the rating system favors drivers since it’s a lot easier for a driver to tank a passenger’s rating (for any reason or none at all) then it is for a passenger to tank a driver’s, since the driver probably has more trips and takes them more frequently so the 1-star would go away entirely a lot faster. 

I have a perfect 5.0 rating and 22 trips. If a driver were to give me a 1-star for the evulz, that would take my rating down to 4.82, rounds to 4.8. It would take about 75 perfect trips to get it back to 5.0. At the rate I take trips, that would take about two years, during which time drivers would think I’m a terrible passenger because of that one evil driver. Hardly seems fair. 

Meanwhile my driver probably already has 100 trips and will accumulate 100 more quicker than I would, so it would tank his rating less and for less time. Unfortunately, Lyft is the only rideshare that services out where I am. Even Uber stops part way through town. :/ How about the weekly driver bonuses that I’ve received for years suddenly disappearing two weeks ago and the support team telling me that they were random from the beginning. So that is why I no longer see low rated pax. I got 17.7 offered the other day, didn't accept and got almost identical bonus offer a few seconds later. Ride was worth 3 bucks+change w/o bonus People always find a reason to complain about something. Just don’t drive for them or start your own rideshare company. Fight for your market share and keep all the money to yourself. 
Complaining on Reddit isn’t gonna do shut but make you look like a miserable unhappy person. Not really. Point by point: 

In my market anyway, Lyft is more profitable than Uber.

I think you're really making a meal of the ""intimidation"" thing. That message has never struck me as intimidating, and acceptance rate only affects bonuses and ride info anyway. 

You can always turn the app to ""last ride"" if you don't want rides to queue. Personally, I like that they automatically queue rather than making me accept the new request-- that always seems to freak passengers out in Uber. 

Fair point on the deductible-- that sucks. 

Finally, on a separate point, Lyft wins outright for its response to passenger misbehavior. In two similar circumstances where a pax threatened my safety, Lyft deactivated the pax. Uber deactivated me for several days before reactivating, and the pax is still active on their platform as far as I know. 

I guess I'd say that neither is objectively worse than the other. It all comes down to market and opinion. Showing the pax name and photo on the ping seems nice, but its enabling racist drivers to deny service. You forgot more ghetto people use lyft

Any very tall drivers unable to let people sit behind them?,18,72.57636449545069,Lyft,"So I’m going to be driving starting next week. My question is to other very tall drivers. I’m 6’5 and have to have my seat back as far as it goes, and can not drive without it all the way back. How do you handle that, with not knowing how many passengers you’ll have at each pickup?","""Can you put your seat up?""

""No."" I am 6' 4"" and adjust seat somewhat for multi pax pick up. Not to the point where it will be unsafe. Seems that every time I do the pax will tell me it is not necessary. They are usually accommodating. I have a rental that you have to spread your legs wide open in the middle back seat, otherwise spacious. I had a big sized family laughing all the way for giving them the chance to be so close as a ""big"" family. Think sardine can close. Just ask any big riders politely if they want to order another ride. That only means your driving style came from those moronic ""Fast and Furious"" and similar movies.
Racing position (I suppose everyone agrees that's the most proper one) - steering wheel high enough, hands if on 9 and 3 keep about 90-110 angle, this provides the best driving sensitivity.

So not accepting rides Is perfecly acceptable though Lyft will send you passive aggressive emails, just laugh at those and delete them. [deleted] This is how I do it, DRIVE ONLY Uber until there are little to no other cars on the road, at night I only do Lyft because it reduces chances of me getting rear ended.  A lot of my pax have told me that their Lyft driver was rear ended in the past.  Why risk $2,500 deductible on something like $3.  Imagine if you didn't have dashcam and other guy somehow brings proof he was doing things right or lies and somehow puts fault on you, that means you will be out on $2,500 for $2.60 or less ride.  Not worth it, Lyft puts too much risk on drivers   Homeless pan handlers make more than you and they get all cash, all of them pretty much make $10+ an hour begging   Even the Romanian refugee beggars here in my city make a lot.  All of them have zero risk in a car or with insurance issues because they are standing outside begging and since it is cash, they don't have to report to IRS."
Driver charged cancellation but never moved or showed up,5,72.85282282879783,Lyft,"On Saturday July 27th I ordered a Lyft to the designated pickup in Downtown Las Vegas. Once the driver accepted the ride it showed that he was located on a street a block away and would need to make a few turns to get to us. We stood on the street where the Lyfts are supposed to drive by to pick us up. After about 5 minutes the driver never moved or called and I got a notification that the ride was cancelled. I quickly ordered another Lyft and the driver was near the same location and picked up up quickly. 

The next day I received a notification that I would be charged 5 dollars for a cancellation. I emailed Lyft and told them I was never called and could provide a call log to prove that. I also told them that the driver never moved from where he was. The support agent gave me what sounded like a pre-typed message about drivers needing gas. I emailed again and he said the driver told him he tried to call twice and drove around the neighborhood looking for us. 

Basically I got told to kick rocks about the subject but my next questions are. Should I call my credit card company and have them remove the cancellation charge since this is a false charge? Is there a way to talk to someone higher up than a standard support agent? I feel like he didn’t listen to what I had to say or even recognize my evidence. 

TL;DR - Driver charged a cancellation fee but never moved his car or called me to see where I was. Support staff seems unhelpful and I’m not sure if I should dispute the charge with my credit card company.","It’s a common driver tactic to wait out the 5 minute pickup timer. Then Lyft charges you a no show/cancellation fee. Getting technical... the driver doesn’t decide the fee. 

They have to be within 0.1 miles (or ~500ft) from the pin that is placed on the map. If they are not, and you truly are a no show, the driver wasted their time and gets no cancellation fee.

500 feet seems like a reasonable walking distance. If you are not standing directly on the pin, don’t expect a driver to cone to you. Lyft’s policies do not reward good customer service here, so... you kinda have to be vigilant with knowing how the app works.

That being said, the point on the map CAN be different then where YOU physically are. You should be able to check the map to verify this in the future.

You’re caught between Lyft’s policies in short changing its drivers and passengers not looking at, comprehending, or attempting to correct the map route.

For me, I go to the pin on the map. Exactly where it is. You should confirm and double check that’s where you expect to be picked up.

Side note: if your pin is in a location that’s unsafe to stop, I may move a little past it, again, check the map.

After all is said — there are asshole drivers and passengers alike. Some will try to scam you out of your fee, some passengers will falsify a report just to get a free ride.

But as far as Lyft is concerned, they verified the Driver was within 500ft of the pin that you confirmed on the map. You not being exactly there is exactly why the driver got the fee. Regardless of how you split the hairs. Lyft might be penny-pinching, soulless jerks... but they are consistent when it comes to polities that are meant to make them money. So I do this all the time because the passenger puts the pickup pin in a dumb as fuck location. It is mind blowing how many people just think I would stop in the middle of a busy road or intersection. Not happening. When you’re requesting a ride, think, is it legal for be them to stop here? If the answer is no, chances are they’re not going to. I’ll get as close as possible but If the passenger can’t walk a block or to meet me so I don’t have to risk getting ticketed, I have no issue taking the 5 bucks and moving on."
"Why would you roll joints in my backseat, Ma****?",2,72.86041542140146,Lyft,"[Chicago]
I had a pax last night rolling some very fresh and premium weed into joints in my backseat. I made sure to contact Lyft support so that they could get in touch with Ma**** and let her know so that just in case she dropped any of that sticky bud she would know it was in my car I just bought last month. She couldn't hear me when I asked her what strain it was, she had some really trashy music that made me think my car's suspension was having a seizure playing in her headphones. I could hear her rolling that paper rather well though, and the smell was pretty darn strong but it vanished as soon as she was done; that's how I know it was of profound quality. Good weed doesn't lose it's fine smell as much as the less sticky blends.


For any autismos out there; I don't smoke and I reported Ma**** to Lyft support over the phone because as per their words; ""that's insane and illegal."" My words exactly. I do advocate for those who would otherwise partake; but keep it the hell out of my vehicle.",That’s so fucked up lol. One time as a passenger I opened my bag and had about an ounce on me (Canada) and he just laughed lol. Obviously didn’t smoke if and the smell went away once I closed my bag. were you on the south or west side?
Why are people driving new cars for Lyft?,17,73.03239458806813,Lyft,"I just saw a 2019 Civic driving Lyft. I don't get it, its cost prohibitive unless you're routinely earning tips and surge etc...


Are people really this dumb?","I wouldnt classify someone as dumb because they drive a new car. I bought a new 2017 Black Tahoe a couple months before I retired. In 2018 I made $75K doing this 45 hours a week (Lyft XL, Black, Lux, Uber Black, Select and XL). My pension pays my Bill's and I used the money I made in 2018 and paid off my Tahoe (keep in mind I traded a 2015 Silverado Crew Cab that was paid off and I got $26K for) and took a 2 month vacation to Europe. Now...I have 45K miles on my vehicle, its paid off and I do this extremely part time if I need to get out of the house. 

The DUMBest thing someone can do is make an assertion when they have no data a out a person's situation If you do it as a business, you can deduct the cost of the lease from your taxable income. Or the depreciation of the purchase price over 5 years 

He needs to make over 32k a year for it to start making sense. It could be just a side gig to earn some extra income. I drive part-time with my new car since I typically only put on about 5K miles a year. Or he is locked into one of the rental programs and he’s making $0. If you’re not educated, there’s a lot of money to be lost. I wouldn’t want to ride in an old car. Taxis are bad enough with 15 year old Crown Vics. Ridesharing isn't the primary source of income for many drivers.  He/she could be working elsewhere making plenty to pay their bills and just wants to drive for a side hustle.  

My car isn't ""new"", but its only four years old and has a great warranty and amazing gas mileage, so it's a good gig to get paid simply for driving around (which I find fun) with low commitment. In Florida they just changed the rules, so you have to have a 2017 or newer to drive. Pretty soon that’s all that’s going to be driving (or they won’t have enough drivers left, which is what I’m hoping). Dumb person here.  Bought a 2019 Dodge Charger because wife and I wanted one.  I love to drive it.  I drive Uber in it because it gives an excuse to drive it and it puts a few coins in my pocket.  Yes I understand it will receive more wear and tear but I truly enjoy driving it so it's worth it to me. People use their personal cars to haul drunk idiots around in the middle of the night, then go online to chastise other drivers about ""depreciation"". #Ironic"
Help contacting Lyft about a driver who demanded I cancel,26,73.1368274584385,Lyft,"Never had this happen before. 

Had a driver show up today that told me I had to cancel because it was a short ride and she wanted to go into Boston, then drove away. The app said it would charge me $5 to cancel, so I ordered an Uber so I could still get to work on time. On my way, she repeatedly called (I ignored it) probably to get me to cancel. After the third time, I checked the app and it let me cancel for free. 

The app won’t let me report her as an issue because I didn’t ride with her. Also, how should I handle something like this if it happens again?","Take screen shots of driver profile and messages telling you to cancel. You can still submit it to support even without the ""report this ride"" option.

  


[Skip the suggested topics and go right to contacting them](https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=724707) You handled it appropriately. The driver will always lose this game of chicken. If they try to scam you and ""drive"" you, then Lyft can tell that and they will be removed from the platform. If they refuse to cancel, eventually they'll make $0/hr and will cancel. If they're abusive to you repeatedly because you won't cancel, Lyft can tell that and they will remove them from the platform. i’m a driver and would never demand a passenger to cancel. screenshots and report her. they will know who it is. I've been a rider and a driver for Lyft and Uber, $5 rides mean the driver might get $3, but for her to tell you to cancel after you've waited, that's so wrong, I would report her so fast. 

Both Lyft and Uber send receipts for the rides via email, check the email for a link to contact them. The same thing happened to me before I was a driver, my driver was late, played heavy metal music which I hate, and to then when we were 1 block away, she turned the wrong way and said she had a new ride to pick up. I told her I was on my way to a DMV appt, but she ignored me, and I got to DMV an hour late. I left complaints with Uber, and demanded my money back. Uber issued me a $5 credit. So sorry this happened Lyft and uber record all phone calls so if u want it on record, answer the phone or call the driver yourself and explain the scenario so it can be heard in reviews The pay for short trips is insulting.  In some areas it is as low as $2.50.  Likewise the pay for being in traffic is very bad.  It sucks that you had to be inconvenienced but this is the type of thing which will happen when the pay to the driver is that low.  If you really want to stop the problem then go on Facebook and Twitter and tell Lyft to start paying drivers better for short trips and for being in traffic. LMAO u get what u pay for - drivers get paid shit now, welcome to the new class of drivers. u/Lyft has really outdone themselves 😁 Shit happens. Carry on. Don't take it personal."
My GF and I were heading to a friends house this weekend for some drinks and were told we needed to select 'ride share' if we both wanted to get in the car.,9,73.14357514363472,Lyft,"Hi there,

As the title says we got in the car and the driver says something to the extent of ""Hello, are you (My GF)?""  She replies ""Yep"".  I get in on the other side of the car and he says that I cannot get in the car and we need to get out immediately and then change the request to 'rideshare' as he put it.

At this point we assumed we did something wrong and looked at the app and couldn't find anything like that, so we cancelled the ride at the request of the driver.  We choose the same exact settings, economy 4 person Lyft.  Another driver got our request.

The driver in our parking lot was not very happy and told us to cancel the request with the new car and try again so that he could get the ride.

My question is, did we do something wrong that we can avoid in the future?

We both have been using Lyft for many years and never had this problem.

Thanks!","Your first driver was a moron, or he was fishing for cancel fees. I'm betting on the former.

Edit: Now that I think of it, he may have wanted you to pick 'Shared' so that he could potentially pick up other passengers. That falls into the moron category, too, though, since Shared sucks. Could have been a new driver. When I started driving a couple of years ago I remember Lyft making you watch videos on how to pick up passengers. They made a huge deal about Lyft line and how it should say how many people would be  entering the vehicle at each pick up. (max 2) The video said that if they had only one rider rider requesting the Lyft line but 2 were entering the car, then to have the passenger add a second passenger. They didnt really have much information on doing a regular Lyft ride which says you can fill the remaining seats with your friends. So I made that same mistake on one of my first rides. luckily the pax was a veteran rider and helped me understand how it worked since i had never taken a Lyft or uber ride before. The most likely scenario is your GF requested a Shared ride and only checked 1 passenger by default. Maybe the driver didn't communicate it clearly, but I doubt he was trying to scam you. If you picked a shares you have to put in the number of people. So there’s enough seats if the next share has a couple people. Don’t charge more to pick up 2. You get what you pay for, including the type of drivers. You should be grateful if the drivers even accepted the ride. I'm going to assume the worst and say that he was hoping it was just your girl riding for god knows what creepy reasons, and when you got in he just quickly said some dumb bullshit hoping you'd go ugh okay and get your own Lyft or something lol. The only thing I can think is that your initial selection was a Lyft Line. I haven't been a driver for a couple years but that used to happen all the time and it pissed me off since the app used to default to Line rides before."
What's going on with these long pickups? I'm done accepting them.,16,73.3954154214125,Lyft,"In Madison WI you get all your rides almost down by the capital. You can be busy all day. I live in McFarland and turned it on as I was leaving and got a long pickup 20 minutes away from me. It's in a town where I imagine there's not a lot of drivers around. I never got a long one before so I figured since I had read a while ago you'd get money for it. Nope. 20 minutes the opposite direction, for a 2 mile ride, and 20 minutes to get back to the starting point of me going to the capital.

&#x200B;

Anyone else just deny the requests?","If it takes more than 5-6 minutes to get to them (with traffic), deny. UNLESS it says it is a 45+ minute long trip. Or if it says it will give you a long pickup fee, which is almost never.

20 minutes away just to pick up is insane. Lyft doesn't pay long pickup fees, so drivers usually reject those, so it goes around and around until the sucker who accepts it is an hour away and still won't get a long pickup fee.

This is one of the reasons I don't drive for Lyft anymore. Lyft is unable to understand the basic concept of ""if you are far from a driver, you're going to have to pay more"" I only take the long ones when it’s going into an area that I’m relatively certain from experience it will be a good tip. if it's over 1.5 miles away, DENIED! I get those long drive short rides about 2x a day. I accept and then cancel saying it's too far away,then go back towards downtown. Call Lyft support and request a long pick up fee. I have seen other drivers saying they did just that and were able to collect a few dollars. I have been riding with a lyft for almost three years and I recently have been experiencing ODD things with them. I am a skeptic for the most part and have always thought hearsay wasn’t the best way to find out things or reliable when it came to anything. So for the past five or six months I was riding lyft a lot more then normal. I live in Phoenix, AZ which is usually a pretty busy area and a big city. I noticed that the last two months have been more odd and my rides were stalling and taking way more time then usual. Then I started to get charged MORE then I did and at the same distance or less. Then unnoticed that their were more Huyandi Sonotas and the drivers started asking really weird or personal questions. But then I started to notice the past month the vibes from most drivers. Drivers going WAY out their way Bc the GPS was purposefully taking them some far out long way. It got worst and worst and then last week was the worst! I had a doctors appt at 225 that was twenty minutes from my home and about 15 miles out. I took lyft rides many times to same doctor Bc I go every month. All day before that EVERY lyft I was ordering was different! Everytime I ordered one, I had to cancel Bc the first driver I ordered STOPPED and I could see on app them just sitting and it would say 3 mins away for like ten mins. I cancelled ride and was charged more then twice that day. I went a few places in lyft that day and I ordered one for my appointment early Bc if i am late I have to pay fee. Of course the same weird three minute sit still! I cancelled after watching on app of the driver sitting and not even in traffic! Here’s the messed up part of this whole thing. So the lyft I finally got came late also. He was not friendly at all and I felt a very strange vibe from the beginning! His name was Kijad and he didn’t even ask my name. He pulled out of my drive way and held up his phone facing me asking me aggressively “WHERE AM I GOING HUH WOMAN?” When the GPS tells you where to go, he was purposely taking me the wrong way it seemed and very fast. I started to say just let me out but he kept saying “Where to or which way?!” Loud too! So I thought to myself either somethings wrong or he just is having a bad day and can’t understand GPS or English. So next thing I know we are on the main highway but not on the route I am used to Bc I had taken lyfts to doctor so many times. I was starting to notice that he was acting nervous and ticking a lot. I said nothing. He not only drove off course but I eventually had to scream to get him to understand that I wanted to get out. Bc he would NOT stop long enough or go slow to let me out. I was terrified. I finally got out by pretty much having to jump at a stop sign by doctor. I called police and told them and they acted like at first there was nothing wrong and stated that he probaly was lost or couldn’t understand English. I’m still on this today. I believe strongly there’s something else going on. Like it was intentional or someone is paying lyft drivers personally Bc I had more then good reason and factual things around the lyft drivers. Please be careful and make sure your driver says your name and if it feels strange at all, get out when you can! Any driver making stops or jerking the wheel is a sign! Thanks for letting me share."
"Lately Lyft has been giving me crap about things out of my control, but I would really like to continue driving.",6,73.77410755105316,Lyft,"I've been driving for Lyft for about 2 years now in the SF Bay Area, and in 870 rides, the worst experience I had with Lyft was a lady spilling part of her soda on my back seat. It has truly been an adventure every day I log in to the driver app and am ready to start driving, I'm sure you guys know the feeling. (I don't get that feeling quite like that anymore, but I still appreciate travelling from San Jose to SF and getting paid for it and just generally going all over the Bay Area.)

The community has been excellent, and the platform has been much better than Uber in the sense that Lyft actually seems to care more about their drivers than Uber does. I started driving with an 05 Camry and actually financed a 2017 Corolla after a year + just so I could use it for ridesharing, I was having such success. 

Anyways I just wanted to say how sad I would be if I ever got deactivated from Lyft because I have met so many cool, positive people while driving from literally all over the Bay Area, and received so much appreciation in the form of tips and even Thank Yous! One thing that really impressed me about ridesharing starting out coming from customer service, is that after every ride, everyone; from older people to teenage kids, would genuinely say thank you when the ride was over. I worked as a cashier and obviously the attitude is different towards retail/food service, but to see that more personal side of people really impressed me starting out. (The occasional $20 tips really impressed me too when I was making $13 an hour as a server) 

But yeah, apparently my account has been flagged for two reasons lately, 
1) Cancelling too often
and
2)Getting contacted by passengers after you've tapped to pick them up, which is completely out of my control. I'm not sure about other markets but here in the Bay Area, it's not uncommon for people to call Lyfts for their parents, girlfriend, boyfriend, co-worker, etc. 

The funny thing about that is that their number spoofing system is broken right now and I don't even receive a call and then when they get in my car they say they've been calling and I have received nothing. Which is unrelated to the issue above but just a quirky thing, I don't even get calls but somehow Lyft detects them calling.","I get those ""too many cancels"" popups almost every day. I have also received an email about it after particularly bad days, like if I cancel more than 4-5 trips. I don't worry about them, these are automated contacts designed to scare us into being slaves. 

As for too many calls from passengers, I've never heard of that one. Seems like if they need to call they need to call. I'm assuming you are at the correct pickup spot every time. 2 years and only 800ish rides? Why bother?"
"New driver, didn't use a promo code...",4,73.80704736586797,Lyft,"I recently applied to drive (stuck on the background check right now but I'm 100% it'll go through eventually), but I didn't use a promo code in my application.  I figured there would be a way to put one in at a later time, like sometime before my first ride...but browsing through the driver app there doesn't seem to be anywhere to do that.

Can I still put in a new driver promo code/guarantee, or is it too late?  If it's too late, is there a way to delete it and start all over again (this time with a promo code). 

Is it really even worth it?  The offer in my area is $700 guarantee for 100 rides.  It's not really a bonus per se, just an insurance in case I can't make $700+ within 100 rides.  Is averaging $7/ride feasible?  In Norfolk Virginia / Virginia Beach",Contact support. I did the same thing. They 'll apply the promo. no they will not be able to put the promo code in Uber is known to accept a promo code after the fact. With Lyft it's a hard NO.
Is Lyft like this often? Just waited for 4 hours in a mall parking lot with no other drivers around and didn’t get any trip requests,10,73.81547329180495,Lyft,Image,"Looks like a normal Lyft day. Should have walked into the mall and filled out a job application or two. Maybe that's why there were no drivers around ... people in that mall don't request rides. If you're a new driver you may need to determine if Uber may be the more-popular rideshare application that people use. I’m in Minnesota and I usually stay near populated cities like Minneapolis-St. Paul and Bloomington. I get a ping on average once every 15 minutes. If it’s a weekend, it’s frequent. The thing about rideshare is you dont decide where the rides come from"
Have you guys ever pulled up to a destination and drove away when you saw it was a group of rowdy drunks?,70,73.89994088439754,Lyft,,"Pro tip. Pull up a little before the pin and make them walk towards your car and you can see if they are way too fucked up. If they are, lock it and drive off The worst is the bait and switch:  sober friend comes over and opens door and gets in then we wait for the stumbling drunk to arrive.  This is why I don’t drive late night anymore. In a way. Twice now I have pulled up, and one of the group thought it would be funny to jump out in front of my car before I came to a complete stop. I canceled the ride immediately both times and reported the passenger to Lyft Safety. The sober one walks up and says “Hey, you’re taking my friend home. He’s just a lil sick, ok?” Yeah, no. Dude can’t walk by himself and he’s barfing all over the place. If he’s “sick” call an ambulance. All the time. I also drive away from people who are smoking as I pull up. Every time. Yeah avoid drunks and rowdy assholes like the plague. Dont hesitate to go into beast mode and kick someone the fuck out on the spot the second they come at you crooked. Oh yes, I have had bars try and dump drunks on me.  I had a pos bartender try and dump a guy who could barely stand.  Yeah she was cursing up a storm when I took off yep I always want to but if I put up with it, they always give me a stupidly good tip. Never, those are my favorite passengers, it is always a good time and why I like driving. What I do not tolerate is rude people in business suits. I will pull the car over and let you out so quick it's not even funny. 5300 rides, 5 star rating, averaging 30 an hour at the end of the week, I have zero incentive to put up with your rudeness. Absolutely Always. Every time. I don't drive groups of drunks. Doing so just quadruples the odds of bad things happening.

If you do drive drunks, double check the back seat when they leave. I stopped driving drunks after one group left their mostly empty bottle of Vodka on the floor in the back seat, and my next passenger found it. What would have happened if I had been stopped by police? Not drunks. But if you have a slice of pizza in your hand, fuck right off. Hey neighbor! P-town here, too. I was out last night and noticed two separate very rowdy crowds, down near Grand Ave. I don't remember the bars. I think it was about 1 am. Each group shouted me down, trying to ""hail"" me, like I'm a cab, cursing me as they noticed the passengers already with me. I figure one of those was probably already cancelled by another driver, hah hah. Maybe their ratings are so low that they can't even get a timely ride any more, anyway. Indeed I have. Yes ABSOLUTELY Yes. A few times. Why would someone do that ? If you're afraid that they will throw up in your car, you should prepare your car by buying them dog covers and a wet/dry vacuum, gloves, and barf bags, it takes me less than an hour to clean up any damage after I get the $150 cleaning fee. Have you ever taken a Drunk couple home and WHEN THEY ARRIVE the female adds a trip to her house to sleep alone instead 😂 bruh it be so awkward. I had a guy fucked up on shit one night think he was high on coke or some shit he was tweaking put his feet on my dash and started playing with my radio asked his politely remove feet and leave radio alone he refused I pulled over on the side of the road middle of nowhere  country about 15 miles from his destination  elbowed him in the face  took his phone and threw him out his phone still sits in a river 6 miles  down the road were I ditched him moral of the story respect me and my car lol got a generous tip before I ditched phone lol $100"
Hollywood Bowl,20,73.92651495848264,Lyft,"Went to the Hollywood Bowl Saturday Night for a sold out event.  We took Uber from a local restaurant (Desert Sun) to the venue and it worked out well.  We tried to take Uber or Lyft from the venue after the event and it was a disaster.  We finally got an Uber 1 hour later back to the restaurant.  This was my first and second time using ride-share and the second time did not go well, so I have questions.

I chose the Reddit Lyft forum because the Hollywood Bowl seemed to want me to use it.  At the exit they have Lyft direction signs, a Lyft waiting area and 2 Lyft vested people helping out.  So I logged into my Lyft app (which I had installed, but never tried) and waited for a nearby driver.  Three separate times I had a driver on the way (5 minutes), but all 3 drivers eventually cancelled the ride.  I noticed very few cars were coming in to pick up people until about 11:45 when all of them arrived at once.  As I said, we eventually got an Uber and I noticed EVERY nearby parking lot was empty!  To me, it looks like the Hollywood Bowl staff gave precedence to all of the nearby parking areas and treated the ride-share cars as lowest priority.  Is this normal?  What should we have done differently?  Should we have gone to a different pick up area or called ahead or taken a cab?  
Thanks in advance.","The Hollywood Bowl is a total disaster for drivers.  You have to fight gridlock traffic, 10 minute traffic lights and drive all the way up the hill for passengers.  It can take 45 minutes for a driver to get to a passenger for a $4 ride.  I ignore all requests to go up there.  
Next time walk down the hill a ways and then request. This is happening at big events more often because of the change in how drivers make money.

A ton of drivers dont want to pick up from these at base prices with no incentives.

Personally I dont even go near big events not worth it Driving around the Hollywood Bowl is not worth it for a lot of drivers, we just don’t get paid enough to make sitting in traffic for 20 minutes to go one block worth it. I'd have walked down to Hollywood and Highland area, or perhaps the neighborhood behind it off of Franklin.  No way any driver is going to sit in that traffic after a Hollywood bowl event.  Some will head towards you and realize how bad the traffic it is and then cancel, most will refuse outright.

Your ride to a local restaurant is EXACTLY why this isn't worth it, the driver would only make $5 for 30 minutes to an hour of work.  That's less than minimum wage.   You might try calling a driver and offer a large cash tip over the phone ($10 or $20) if you absolutely don't want to walk, otherwise they're not going to wait in traffic for you.  Only choices are to move away from the event or wait until the traffic dies down.

We can't see where you are going so most drivers will assume you're going minimum fare distance ($5 or less) when decided if sitting in traffic is worth it.  Calling them may help, but since you literally are the worst case scenario and a very low paying ride, you'd have to promise a cash tip to get me to even consider it.  

Lyft is awful for drivers and we actively have to outsmart the platform to make any money.  They've changed how surge prices work during events, so Lyft almost always keeps any additional money they make raising the prices due to high demand, and in general they only pay us HALF of what you pay them. As a driver, I never ever accept rides from the Hollywood Bowl. Not worth my time and money. [deleted] My advice is don't rideshare from events. So nobody sucks drivers into this mess. Drivers don't want to cancel and affect their ratings unless they have to.

Venues aren't built with rideshare in mind. They built and paid for a huge parking lot and they will prioritize this. And organizers don't respect rideshare. They move pickup points and close roads without telling anybody. And they direct pax to some pickup points away from drivers. Somebody should start calling them out, storm their barriers and shut them up. They don't know what they are doing. We are effectively boycotting the local airport leaving pax who cannot afford a taxi crying on the last flights.

The best is to bring your own car. If you have to, prepare to walk the nearest civilization such as a MacDonald with a good road network around it. Enter MacDonald on the app; never enter an address if you don't have to. Whenever I get a ride going to or from the Hollywood Bowl, I immediately cancel, turn off the app and drive a cool 20 to 30 minutes away from the venue.

Same with similar venues like Dodger Stadium, the forum in Inglewood, etc 

It's simply not worth it I was in a situation fairly similar to that, every driver would cancel after 5 minutes, as they were hitting the time mark to cancel and they would get their cancellation fee.  I decided to write in a message to the next one:  I have $10 cash tip at the beginning of the trip, one showed up within 10mins.  I guess he was willing to wait out the line for the trip and the $10 tip starting the trip.  Gave him 5-stars and wrote a comment thanking him for sticking it out. I’ll drop off at large events. But I won’t do the pick ups. Not worth the hassle. Traffic. Masses of people.  I don’t even go hear them so I don’t have to deal. I don't drive Lyft in Hollywood, only Uber.   Lyft pays 10 cents a minute only when the customer is in the car, so an extra hour in traffic only pays about 6 bucks extra.  Lyft stopped ""prime time"" multipliers and pays stupid random bonuses but is probably still charging you the same about as Uber but they're keeping most of the money. 

Also Lyft probably rematched your drivers with someone closer to them but you see it as a cancelation on your end. I was at the Hollywood Bowl earlier - on Odin heading towards LOT B and the security guard waved me down Cahuenga instead, I ended up cancelling the ride because I couldn't get in and that's the way the app tells us to go. Hollywood Bowl pickups = waiting an hour for a potential $3. Fuck that. That’s why. Until driver pay is raised, you’re never going to be able to rely on finding a Lyft from a busy event. u/Lyft Last year, I got a ping at the Hollywood Bowl. That was when PrimeTime was still around. It took over 30 minutes to get to the pickup point and then my cell signal cut out at the top of the hill and I couldn't find my passenger. That was the first and last time I've accepted a ping for that location."

Progressive too. I use progressive. You moved out of Boston??? I see you all the time over on r/BostonRideShare I have USAA but they dont have rideshare insurance yet for PA but i heard they will starting mid September. I just signed up with Erie in Pennsylvania. Best policy best rates.  Qualify best rates- I have clean driving record. Drive black on black Premium SUX and pay well under $200 Geico not adding premium SUVS for rideshare.  I WAS A 20 year geico customer.  After shopping around I found Erie and I have great rep.  Private me for his name and number. I am not sure.  I can ask.  I will get back to you. Erie only writes in PA
3 hours online with no trips. New driver,39,74.574720977026,Lyft,Image,"I had similar fails early in my short moonlighting gig.  The number 1 thing, don’t drive around waiting for rides.  Once I had learned enough lessons the hard way, I would start off with prepping my car then turn the app on and sit on my couch.  Start a good movie, that brings the ping.  Or realize you forgot to hit the restroom before going online.  Nothing brings on the rides like a full bladder. Yep.  Run Uber as well, twice the chance of a ride. Christ Alive 😱.

Where do you live? I didnt start making money with it until I drove evenings and nights. Days are pointless where I live. Also make sure you stay around a major city. Do you live in a forest?  Another good strategy is to not cluster where other drivers are located, go drive elsewhere that is population dense (a location with many apartments) or another part of town with open businesses such as restaurants and bars or even an event venue (comedy club or community center).  Also check your city’s events page on social media or from an online source to see what shows or popular attractions may attract a crowd such as a carnival or band playing where parking can be a challenge or alcohol may be served. That's crazy, my 1st day with Lyft was 4 hours and no rides. I do uber and lyft and it's about 50/50 now. But that 1at day, nothing.  St Louis area At least sit next to railroad station or mall Reach out to Lyft and ask them if your vehicle is properly set up or missing any coding. I know that on Uber, vehicles sometimes need their own coding to function properly. Past 2 days, only had 2 Lyft rides and over 16 Uber rides. Both apps running at the same time. I figure if I ever get deactivated from Uber, I might as well quit ride-sharing altogether. The loss can be just as valuable What area are you in? My first day was 7 and a half hours with 1 ride. I feel you buddy Lyft is dying in a lot of markets.  Drive with Uber and Lyft. Depends where you're at. If you're sitting in a not so busy area of your town where most of the people who would need it, it's going to go to those who are in the areas who ARE needing a ride.

Like Madison WI. Ya I can sit a ways away to get away from teh crazyness but if I'm sitting somewhere down by the capital square, I'm going to get a lot of hits. Install Uber and Lyfts passenger apps. See if theres any other drivers around you. You may be in a low demand area. It was rock and roll here, 28 rides in 8 hrs $235.

Minute/miles pay should go up.,13,74.58400338443342,Lyft,"I personally wish they would consider more to give us for 10-15 minute 2 mile trips. In LA I refuse to drive during 430-630pm just because traffic is so horrible and Lyft does nothing to provide a better rate. Litereally drove almost an hour(from point a to point b, not even including the drive to pick her up) for a 25 mile trip. And I earned the same doing the exact same distance for 27 minutes(I got like 1-2 more dollars for spending 50 extra minutes.) It's terrible. They need to up their pay for minutes.

Or when I get a short .5 mile trip that has 2 stops (going back and fourth), about 10-12 minutes in total. Get only 2.89. While I had to drive like 5 minutes to get there. Not even worth it. 

I also wish they would give you more for driving 15 minutes to pick people up. Several times I had to drive almost 10 miles to pick someone up or even more.  And just to get an 3 mile trip? And get barely 3 dollars? Kidding me. 

Just small rants. I could say more but I enjoy it sadly because it gives me such free time to do what I like to do on the side which is streaming/cosplaying. So :/","Yep, if I wind up in Hollywood I just turn off Lyft, Uber is the traffic app.  If it's lyft  I'll straight up tell people I'm getting paid 3 bucks for every 30 minutes of traffic. If you are willing to drive for the current rate, why would they increase the rate? If enough drivers quit, maybe they will increase the rates."
Has Anyone actually been deactivated due to a low acceptance rate? My account has apparently been flagged for low acceptance.,8,74.59783440296296,Lyft,"According to Lyft, cancelling a ride at the airport I couldn’t reach due to their faulty maps system saying I could go somewhere I wasn’t able to, and not wanting to drive an additional 6 miles to make a detour, led to a “poor passenger experience” and that my account was flagged. Anyone have any insight on this?","I think you can't cancel more than 15 rides during the last 100 rides or some crap. I think the issue was the pax complained they got cancelled on. Its whatever. acceptance rate and cancellation rate are 2 very different things. Both uber and lyft are hyper-sensitive about airport cancellations. Not sure why since there is literally a parking lot full of thirsty drivers who wait for hours to get one single ride. Regardless if you cancel on too many airport pickups, or any pickups really, you can get a temporary suspension or even your access to the queue revoked. 

Acceptance rate just means declining rides before you even accept them. You can do that all damn day. I know but he also stated he cancelled in his explanation and thus affected his acceptance rate.  When I have cancelled in the past after accepting, my acceptance rate drops. It seems to weigh more heavily too. At least in my experience."
This is why I only do Lyft at nights in Minneapolis when there are way less cars or near zero. Dude got into Lyft accident when he couldn't hit drop off and Lyft wouldn't cover it.,17,74.75325106962963,Lyft,"Hello all,

I was driving Lyft last Friday night in Minneapolis, MN. I had dropped-off a passenger but the app did not recognize the drop. Because of this I continued to drive to try and get the ""dropped-off"" button to come-up on my phone. While doing so and looking at my phone, I took a right down a one-way going the WRONG WAY and was involved in a T-Bone collision. My car was totaled and I was almost killed.

My primary insurance is now telling me that they will not cover me because I did not have the ""RideShare insurance"". Something that I opted out of almost a year ago (when I was not driving nor did I plan to).

Lyft is also refusing to cover my collision damage because they are saying I was in Phase I (without a passenger). I now have no car and an outstanding loan of $17,000.

WHY ISN'T LYFT REVIEWING YOUR INSURANCE AND RECOMMENDING THAT YOU ADD THE RIDE-SHARE ADD-ON THROUGH YOUR PRIMARY CARRIER?! Or at a minimum, trying to make sure people understand their insurance more clearly prior to signing up.

I'm wondering anyone has any advice?! I have been racking my brain over the last few days trying to figure this out and have been getting the stiff-arm from Lyft. Any contacts of help you reached out to would be VERY HELPFUL..... PLEASE HELP!!!","The fuck are you talking about, that idiot was looking at his phone while driving and blames the Lyft app because he chose not to pull over and figure out what was wrong when the app malfunctioned, during which he turned onto a wrong way street and got t-boned (which doesnt make sense for his course of events but whatever)... Holy shit, that driver is an idiot.

In no particular order:

Does not have proper insurance coverage.

Doesn't know how to use the app

Drives while looking at their phone

Makes a right turn without looking, somehow.


-and the post is a year old. How bored are you rn? What does time of day have to do with not being retarded? Did you read the story? Dude said the “Drop off” button didn’t come up, so instead of doing the safe thing and pulling TF over, he continued to drive and fix the issue. His distracted driving led to the accident, *not* time of day. 

There’s been many times where the app won’t let me drop off. So you know what I do? I find a close spot to pull over so I can take care of it. You can’t get into an accident if you’re parked. 

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I had that same thing happen to me where the app froze after I tried to hit the drop off button. It was rush hour in downtown Seattle and I told myself I wouldn’t let that stupid app distract me, so I pulled over. This entire industry is a risk and they are predatory with insurance.. for example there's no medical coverage either It is very painful and expensive to be stupid.  Not giving Lyft and out here but he should have pulled over and tried ending the ride.  This happened to me once and I pulled into a parking lot, found out I just had a bad signal and went inside a McDonald’s to use their WiFi.  He’s right though, Lyft should notify drivers that they should have rideshare insurance.  I’ve always had it. It makes sense well lyft/uber dont mention the rideshare insurance because for many drivers it can double your premiums which would be an instant deal breaker and they'd never sign up. They're preying upon driver ignorance. Shows you just how classy these companies are. 

As for the driver, well he has options which I'm sure he's exercised by now. He can either default on the loan and let whatever happens happen (collections, possible wage garnishment, or possibly nothing at all) or he can go ahead and try to get it repaired anyway. Just because insurance wrote it off as totaled doesnt mean he cant spend $4000 and get the frame welded back together and everything else repaired, depending upon how bad the damage really is. 

It's certainly easier to drive at night though. As a night driver myself and living in the shadows of society I sometimes forget how much traffic is out in the day time. Fuck paying $2,500 deductible"
(Lost item) should I be worried,6,75.36675801407408,Lyft,"Person comes in, supposedly with an item, then leaves the item in the car. Then calls me asking me about the item. Though when I search the car, it’s not there. Did several rides after the person had left the car, so my guess was someone had taken it. 

Over the night the rider gets angry saying she has all my personal information. Texting me through Lyft’s number. And I shouldn’t mess with her. Should I be worried? I’ve already spoken to critical response Lyft has, and contacted the authorities over her threat.

I don’t understand why pax threaten the driver when they, themselves are responsible for taking with them what they bring.","We are not responsible for lost items - end of story. She doesn't have any of your information what are you talkin about? Don't just contact lyft critical response, call the non-emergency police number / go to your local police branch and file a police report. Get her personal info. Level ground in the battlefield. Does your voicemail contain your full name or phone number? If so I would be worried as they can get your personal information that way.

They probably didn't leave any items in your car if they're resorting to threats. Most likely it's an attempt for blackmail or something more sinister. Best to just avoid as much as humanly possible.

And ask Lyft to disconnect your number from the rider if they haven't already."

"Lyft drivers. If three passengers take Lyft to the airport, each having a luggage not excessive. One bag each, small 21 inch or smaller roller boards. Would it be best to tip cash or on the app?",16,75.71627190297401,Lyft,"So if we each tip a few dollars then add the regular tip, fine with us.
What if we get one of the drivers that just opens the trunk and let’s you place and retrieve your own bag?  Should the tip be the same?","Cash is always better but its totally up to you.  Just don't say ""I'll tip in the app"".  Most who say that never actually tip. Cash is always better regardless. Obviously cash is king but if you're gonna leave a large tip and don't have cash tipping in the app is fine too.

 As for drivers that don't help here is a few questions. Are you really that old and can't put your luggage in?
Is the driver old and maybe cant lift it? Good to know. I always tip hotel drivers a few dollars for helping with my bag. Cash I’m pretty old. But I can lift my own luggage.  Was asking with regard to the tip. Should it be the same for those that help and those that do not. When you’re catching a Lyft at the airport, if they have “helpers” from Lyft there, do **NOT** let them touch your bags. Those merry mental midgets will throw your bags in. I swear, I think it’s a competition to see which bags bounce. Never seen Lyft helpers at the airport. If you appreciate the service, tip.

If you feel like they went above and beyond, tip more.

If you appreciate the service but don't feel like they met your expectations, tip, leave a 4 star review and put in a comment. The driver will be able to read the comment but won't know who left it, and some drivers will be curmudgeonly about it, but most will see ""oh I guess people generally expect me to do X or Y"".

Tip cash or in the app, it really doesn't matter. Cash means we get to tax dodge, but the app is just as immediate for the drivers who have their payout linked to a debit card. Cash is king. I wonder what ever happened to being decent people and just helping someone with luggage out of you know, decency. 

Every damn driver is so obsessed with tips nothing else matters anymore. Seriously, these shouldn’t be talked about this much. It sets such a disgusting precedent and adds to the already toxic tipping culture. If you determine the amount of tip by whether the driver handled your bags for you, you’re an entitled asshole. No. Tipping is for good service. I always tip. Added that to the post immediately.  A driver getting out of the car to help with three bags deserves an extra 9-10 dollars. Driver does not even have to get them all just help. An airport sky cap would be thrilled with a 9-10 dollar tip for handling luggage that is often much larger and heavier. 
Call me what you want. I’m not tipping extra if the driver just opens the trunk. 

Good day to you. Hoping you meet wonderful people. Knowing the people I’m going to be with the extra portion could easily end up being 30 dollars. Had been thinking of my personal portion of the tip.   It’s early here. Starting first coffee. I’ll always offer to help with luggage. In my other job, I can be lifting 50+lb TVs and computers, so, that stuff is easy for me.

Going the extra mile for people will most likely be noticed. Got more tips just from helping.

Heck, even doing things like opening the door for passengers makes them happy. It’s the little things, you know?"
"Lyft is threatening to deactivate me for not accepting rides,",32,75.79643394002484,Lyft,"They say because my accept rate is super low and something called lapse they will deactivate if this continues. 

What are my rights as a Lyft driver
What are my rights as a 1099, 

Any help with sources would be appreciated","You can't be deactivated for not accepting rides. 

If you're cancelling too many rides though, that will definitely get you canned. I think you may have misunderstood the message. They won’t kick you off for low acceptance rate but they will for a high cancelation rate. Those are 2 different things. > Your acceptance rate is the percentage of incoming calls that you accept.  Every driver should strive to have a 100% acceptance rate.

> Uber and Lyft no longer penalize drivers with deactivation even if their acceptance rate is really low.  That’s because they’re afraid courts might rule that drivers are employees if they exercise that much control over how drivers perform their work.  Traditionally, companies could not force independent contractors to accept any particular jobs.  But Uber and Lyft have essentially done just that in the past.

> So now, instead of deactivating drivers for low acceptance rates, they simply push those drivers off to the side and send jobs to drivers with higher acceptance rates.  And why shouldn’t they?  Why should they keep sending jobs to drivers with low acceptance rates?  That just hurts the service as passengers have to wait longer and longer to be assigned a driver.  So while making good legal sense, it also makes good business sense as well. Are you not accepting rides ? >What are my rights as a Lyft driver What are my rights as a 1099,

You have no rights. This is the problem with treating workers like independent contractors. do you feel like a contractor or an employee now? you have no rights because they can terminate at any time for any reason as can you. If you are declining rides why you don't log off instead ? You don't have rights as a 1099, you are an independent contractor, which means you are by definition an at will employee."
Seriously!,14,75.79942005113595,Lyft,Image,"I picked up a woman with 2 6 year olds. 

They were literally going from the mall. To the fast food place 100 yards away. They would.l not even cross streets. Just walk across parking lot. 

Everyone looked able bodied. 

Took me 10 minutes to arrive at their location. Maybe the passenger has something heavy to carry, or an injury, or is wearing heels, or is vision impaired, or had a ride lined up that bailed and will be late if they walk.  Lots of reasons someone would use a ride service for a short distance. Lmaaooooo I don’t do rides like this often but have noticed sometimes when I do they tack on an extra buck or two and prompt me with a message saying “more for this ride” How are you getting notifications about trip distance and direction? That looks like a 15 minute walk. Depending on the weather, that seems reasonable. Obviously they don't wanna walk Dude I had a obese woman yesterday go two blocks. No joke it was infuriating"

Stupid Cancellation,8,75.92029968077662,Lyft,"I was online, got a ping from a pub maybe 6 miles away, and headed over there. It was late at night (around 3 am), so not much traffic, but many of the traffic lights are stupid where I am, and take forever, and will change when traffic is coming. Because of this, the time estimate changed by a few minutes; for instance it was initially 18 minutes to the destination, and when I was stopped at a light, 3 minutes away *(but distance wise it would’ve only taken 1 minute to get there)* it updated to 5 minutes away. The light changed just after that, and then I receive a notification that the passenger cancelled, and it didn’t give me a cancellation fee because it said that the time estimate was different than the initial one (and as it happens, I arrived at the location faster than the initial estimate). 

The only good thing is that there don’t seem to be that many drivers in my area, particularly late at night (on a weekend I’ve received fares that are 15 miles away) , so I had the satisfaction of seeing the stupid paxs standing outside the closed pub, and heard one say, “Wait, was that the driver?” as I drove away, knowing it would probably be a long time before they got another ride.","Why would you accept fares that are so far away? My general rule is that I don't accept anything more than 10 minutes away. Shouldn't have ever accepted that ride in the first place. Seems like you got scammed out of a long pickup fee also. Did you send a help message to Lyft?

They will usually send you the 5 bucks if you have a high rating and it doesn't show that you took a stop at a gas station or some bullshit. I've had this happen several times when I get stuck behind an accident or worse than normal rush hour traffic."
False passenger claims,0,76.01292699559143,Lyft,"My thoughts are this. If passengers continue to rate good drivers poorly or claim they are under the influence with the intention of getting a free ride, all the good ones will either quit or be deactivated. This will result in every single trip being a bad one. If you actually enjoy having on demand taxi service use that report feature only when necessary. It also bogs down support so they end up having to investigate the matter at hand instead of working to make things better for passengers and drivers alike.

Passenger rejected twice for airport travel.,50,76.18727884745432,Lyft,"So I picked up a rather nice gentleman yesterday who said that two Lyft drivers refused to take him to the airport, because according to him those Lyft drivers said “We’re not allowed to.”

Now, I’m confused here because you don’t need a TNC sticker just to drop people off at the airport. I’ve taken care of 5 airport passengers in the last two days and I’m just scratching my head as to why he’d say that.

I’ve worked retail for 25 years prior working for Lyft, so an exceptional customer experience for me is paramount. I happily obliged my passenger, and I took him to the airport as requested. Ended up getting a rather generous tip from him.

Does anyone here have any idea why some Lyft drivers would say that they can’t go to MSP Airport because they’re “not allowed?” Very confused, here.

Please take care of our customers!","Probably more likely they didnt wanna go to the airport.. 

Customer service is cool and all but drivers wanna make a decent living too As far as I know, you only need the TNC sticker to pick people up. However, this would require your colleagues to read the notices and not communicate misinformation among themselves. some people are scared of the airport because they ""simply haven't done it"" or don't know the rules therefore, an airport ride is ""intimidating"".  There is nothing in the rulebook that a driver can't tell  a rider a lie while cancelling a ride, just like a police officer isn't held liable for any lies he/she tells you. Per MSP airport ordinance 124, sections 3.2 and 3.3, you only need a permit and decal to pick up passengers,  not to drop them off.


Lyft and Uber are required to, in real time, alert the airport authority any time one of their cars enters or exits airport property, whether or not they are permitted drivers.   That's probably why you can't turn the app off.

Legally, you're prohibited from denying a ride based on destination in the MSP metro, so if a passenger reported a driver for doing that the driver could face a fine and be banned from operating as a TNC driver in the twin cities metro. Does not always have to be a reason why that is logical, it could be as simple as people not wanting to go in that direction. 

I picked up a guy at San Francisco airport who wanted to go to San Jose, he was cancelled on by “several drivers” for reasons he nor I understood as San Jose was a fairly lucrative ride back in 2015. Those drivers probably got it stuck in their head they will get a ticket without the tnc sticker.  

Even I been under the impression that if you are driving for Lyft or Uber and don't have a tnc sticker you'll get a ticket if cought dropping off and picking up. Cause I also been told you can't be on airport property without the sticker. 

I'm also from the twin metro. It's probably bc it's just not worth it and that is just what they tell the passengers.   
In Philly you get maybe get 10 or 11 bucks to drive there from downtown.  Then you need to just turn around and drive right back.    You can wait 30 to 50 min in the airport queue, but that is a money loser.   
I cancel every single airport ride until I start getting the cancel warning in a single day.     I have been doing on average 135 rides a week and haven't been to the airport in at least a month. I've done the airport a handful of times. It's a pain in the ass to navigate and you really will only make good money if they tip. I've only had one person tip me at the airport. I always help with their bags too. The big thing for me is if I pick up at the airport it's usually a long trip and I end up getting stuck in a different area far from home. I once had a lady that went 50 miles from the airport and I didn't get a single trip on the way back. The $20 I made off of that lady took over two hours counting the return trip. I wouldn't know about that particular airport but if you're from New jersey and someone wants you to take them to JFK or LaGuardia airports to drop them off.. you can, but then if you have no TLC plates you can't pick anyone up and it's never worth it unless clients gives you cash.. because I've done it 3 times where I've dropped off then the app won't let me pick anyone up once I drop them off making the trip all the way back to jersey for free.. sometimes hours if there is traffic. Never worth it!! I always decline trips to New York as a Jersey Lyft driver, unless it's by the tunnel or bridge. At LAX you're supposed to have a TNC placard to drop anyone off. The guy with Lyft told me and several others in this group getting an inspection in Brooklyn Park that you need a permit to drop off and pick up at the airport. I knew the law and corrected him and told everyone the correct law that you can drop off without the permit but you needed one to pickup. Not sure how long he was telling people that. I think they wanted people to get the permit and were trying to force people to do it. Airports are confusing clusterfucks of shittery and I wouldn’t blame someone for avoiding them. After three airport trips when I was just starting I automatically reject them now. But he should have been honest, of course we’re allowed in airports. You are correct you don't need a TNC sticker to drop of at MSP.  But you do for pickups, but i'm not sure why anyone would wait in that queue so i'm sure it's just not worth it for them. How far were you from the airport? Was it during rush hour? Maybe it wasn’t worth taking the trip. It depends on your airport. What airport was this? Yeah but he's probably one of a few that paid you well what's really screwed up about Rideshare is the companies are almost charging cab fares but they're taking 30 to 60% of what they charge the customer and most customers have no idea that drivers are getting underpaid The only time I'd refuse is if it's out of state. Dropping someone off and then not being allowed to pick up until I get back into my own zone is the biggest pain in the ass. No you can't go to the airport without the card. And are you for real with your 25 ""retail experience so being a good servant is paramount"""
Road Raged Lyft Driver - Atlanta,43,76.21932745857647,Lyft,"I had an unfortunate encounter with a motorist with an escalated level of road rage. Warning, video has strong language of the driver trying to intimidate me

It all started when I was riding on the bike lane on Edgewood. This motorist (with Lyft decal at rear) stopped in front of me to drop someone off when I had to whip around the vehicle. In doing so, I yelled out ""don't stop in the bike lane."" When I stopped at the next light (Boulevard), she drove onto incoming traffic to catch up to me and yelled out loud to get my attention. When I looked over, she chunked a cup full of water at me and ran the red light to flee. While I admire her care for cooling me down, I wanted to catch up to her to get her tag. She attempts to brake check me as I approached the rear of the vehicle and that's when the video starts (when I realized my GoPro was not running). At the beginning of the video, she was trailing right behind trying to run me over. I pulled into a parking lot and dialed 911. Throughout my phone call with police, she threatened me and even went to her trunk to grab a weapon. 

Why would Lyft ruin their reputation with an aggressive driver like this?

I do agree this lady shouldn't be on the road with that kind of rage and definitely shouldn't be driving for lyft. You just don't have the proof to show it. i guess people downvoting you didn't watch your video. that seems psychotic. i am a lyft driver and the replies excusing her behavior seem to not recognize the dangers and illegalities of what appears to stalking at best, but maybe aggravated assault, reckless driving and who knows what else Not excusing the psycho driver's behavior, but you'd make a stronger case if you provided footage prior to you fleeing into the eatery of what actually transpired.  Did you hit or kick her car?    
There is likely more to the video than the narrative you are sharing.  I've seen it before with motorcycle videos of a rider being chased by a roadrager only to discover the rider was antagonizing the driver moments before.  You should absolutely report to Lyft, but the police will want to see the full video and determine if it's worth pursuing and citing the driver. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6102  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/41295) We're gonna need to see the rest of the video before you're gonna get any of us to pick up our pitchforks. Not showing the video in it's entirety just makes it look like there is something you don't want us to see. Do you have footage of her throwing the water on you? As much as it was escalated, in the future just drive around and be done. If you gotta yell about someone pulling over then do it to yourself. 

She clearly is off the handle and needs a break but just like any car pulling over for a drop off in the city, just move along. Yeah it's an inconvenience and yes they could have continually circled looking for the best drop off point but it happens. Everyone is just trying to get through their day, and I'm absolutely guilty of losing my stuff (I think most humans are) in the confines of my car but yeah I wouldn't track your bike down like that. 

Thanks for sharing but this is not a Lyft issue. Glad the police helped you and hopefully her punishment is not as harsh as it could be."
How is this ok?,44,76.24608671783574,Lyft,"I waited nearly 20 minutes for a driver who was finishing another ride. He got to, literally, one house away --i saw him as I walked out the door-- then he turned right instead of left. He then cancelled the ride. I went from being on time to work to now being 30 minutes late. How is it fair that Lyft states I could be charged for cancelling a ride after 2+ minutes, but a driver can do so when he's made me wait 20, been within feet of my doorstep, then either made a wrong turn or changed his mind? Is there no way to report this?","sounds like your ride was auto added to the driver while he was driving. Driver did not accept this trip, it was forced on him. Once he saw it was a shared ride, he canceled as soon as he could.

I would suggest never using share ride option if you have to be there on time. Big risk to save a few bucks. Lyft tacks on rides automatically without the option to deny them. If I’m done for the day and have additional rides I turn off the app and go home. This probably was the case. If not then he’s just an asshole. I’m sorry you were late to work. He didn’t make you wait 20 minutes, he was finishing another ride.

Driver didn’t make you wait 20 minutes. You waited 20 minutes for a 20 minute ride and he noped out for a better passenger. Maybe with another rideshare company. 

You saved a few bucks and got to work late. There’s a life lesson here. Was it a shared ride request 🤣 I've heard Lyft drivers can't see a destination until they've picked you up, too. Assuming this is true, does anyone have an idea what the rationale is behind the company not giving them all the information they need to determine if they'll accept a request in the first place? If this was a case of the driver getting close enough for my destination to finally display and he decided against it, fine. It's still shitty to make someone wait 20 minutes then cancel when you're one house away, but he obviously had his reasons for not wanting to go where I'm going. But it would seem beneficial to drivers, riders and Lyft to give everyone all the information up front so shit like this doesn't happen. One thing I do when I arrive is that if I don’t immediately see my passenger, I’ll give them a call and let them know I’m there. I’ll call twice (sometimes my passenger’s phone is dead), and then wait the entire five minutes the app is telling me to.

I may not park at the exact pin because sometimes there is nowhere safe to park, or requires an illegal (and sometimes dangerous) U-turn. I’ll instruct the passenger where to go.

Luckily I have yet to have a no-show passenger. I don’t mind if people are somewhat late for pickup. I drive when I have plenty of spare time. How far is ur ride? Nop shit happens Maybe he had a flat or maybe he had something personal come up or he just did not want to take ur ride Lower rates make it so that we have to be very very picky about destination. Lyft doesn’t SHOW US destination until we start the ride or enable “tap to arrive” (this violates contractor laws)... so, he locks your ride in just in case, then if unhappy with your destination (or gets a better offer with Uber (higher surge etc.) he uses one of his few cancels to move on from you.

It’s the sad reality of how terrible pay has gotten for drivers. Of course, the customer pays the same as before, and even pays surge prices- u/Lyft just keeps that money for themselves and leaves the driver out.

I have had this problem in San Diego, particularly with Lyft. During busy times, Uber pays a surge to drivers when Lyft doesn’t. My phone gets blown up with tons of Lyft requests, which I HAVE to refuse while waiting for a surge-paying Uber request.

If your market is like mine, Uber is a little more reliable now. Still shitty...both companies are towing the line on illegal employment practices, attracting the absolute WORST kind of drivers.

I even only can afford to drive on holidays/big events now, otherwise it barely comes to minimum wage after costs."
Driver Canceled Rider After Drop Off,4,76.30322792153943,Lyft,"Hello,

A few weeks back I took a ride from Lyft to the Airport, SFO. This was my first time ever using a ride share service.

The ride was estimated at about a little over $100. Well, as I got in the car, i noticed the driver avoided most highways and took a what seemed like a longer route on the side roads. It was not what google maps suggested.

Well, after a very very long ride, I got in and checked in at the airport and went to my gate. As I sat downx I looked at my phone and it said the driver has canceled the ride, and it never charged my card. 

I am now in a different country and have no way to rectify it.

What happened here? Why did he cancel?","Felt bad for not being able to follow the GPS? If he is a scammer then he is the dumbest scammer ever! Why do you want to rectify it? If you can afford to, you can always call the US Lyft support number. Maybe $0.02 a minute in the civilized world or free. I guess you can chat and email too. But really there's nothing you can do about it if the driver didn't want your money.

Maybe he's new and/or totally screwed up. He hoped to rectify it before you have the chance to report it to Lyft. He has no defense if the route and time are way off from the GPS estimate.

Very often the freeways are heavily congested. The smaller roads may be better. And he might get lost. I think somebody decided to renew every road, major and minor street in my state. Last night the at least 7 lane major freeway closed down to one. Horrible. He read that you are a nasty or stingy person so he thought it's the clever thing to do to cancel it.

Maybe he felt sorry for you for whatever reason. Did you have a conversation? If the final fee was way over the estimate, he may feel bad. One way is to cancel it. Or he could call support saying that he screwed up and ask them to charge you a fair estimate instead. $100 is no big deal in some markets and for some drivers. 

Maybe he's an honorary member of the local tourist board. Maybe he rants and complains about or even scams his riders every day but tourists are just different. It's like no matter how rotten and beaten your house is, you are still proud of it. If the driver wanted your money, he will do all the work and you’ll get charged (or maybe you still won’t get charged). 

Either way, the driver can fix everything on his end. I would just take the blessing if I were you. 

Were you coming from Sacramento or Modesto? He might have been on surface streets to avoid some congestion. lol i WaNt To gIvE mY MoNeY awAy PleaSE"
My Lyft driver followed me on Twitter as soon as I got in the car- how is this possible?,27,76.53667699562455,Lyft,"Hey all,

Very confusing thing happened to me on my ride home tonight. As I stepped into my Lyft, I got a notification that I somebody had followed me on Twitter. Much to my surprise, the new follower was my Lyft driver. Same first name, profile picture was him. How is this possible? Is my Twitter somehow linked to my Lyft account? Very confusing. 

Thanks!","I have had passengers pop up on my Facebook suggested friends lists before. your account is not linked to twitter, that’s pretty suspicious Driver can see first name and last initial. That can be enough depending on the name and location. Profile Pic helps narrow it down. A douche move in any case. Thanks for the insight. I sent a screenshot of the twitter to Lyft support and asked them to confirm or deny that it’s the same guy. The name isn’t common (at least in the US), and they look the same. However it was dark and I only have the driver’s first name to go by. The twitter includes the full name so that why I sent it to Lyft.  I supposed it COULD be a coincidence but the timing was too perfect for me to assume it was an accident. I’m not even bothered by the situation, just SO curious. Google image search for your avatar? Lyft Drivers can see your avatar, and thus it's probably possible those could be captured and searched somehow. Is your name unique ? Mine is ..mine is two names put together you would never expect to be put together. I pop up always on google because my name is so unique ... maybe shorten your name on Twitter (I’m about to do that) .. Lyft driver and private software engineer, here. Assuming that this wasn't just a fluke, just for the sake of entertaining the possibility you're suggesting, I'll confirm that it's certainly possible.

A skilled programmer could write a custom app to automatically take the desired action (e.g. following your Twitter) upon accessing the data you've made available, through the platform. Though obscured by Lyft, and for the sake of your privacy, upon accepting a ride request, your private information made available to your driver is generally limited to the extent of your first name, possibly your last initial, whatever photograph you might have uploaded, and both your departure and destination locations.

Depending upon the accessibility of any additional private information that you've previously shared publicly on the internet, and the potential that an exact match can be cross-referenced to that private information, what you're suggesting isn't unfathomable and only relies upon the programming skill and motivation of your driver. Such a pursuit might not even necessarily be a malicious attempt to invade your privacy, but perhaps some kind of a white-hat experiment in social engineering, or possibly treading into the grey areas of ethical hacking.

Additionally, the suggestion of another reply here also seems quite possible, that a reverse image search might be productive if your profile photo is a close match to another you've previously used on the public internet. Until massive advancements in public services for facial recognition and publicly accessible facial image data come further along, avoiding this is usually as simple as avoiding the use of the same image you've previously used, or even avoiding using outtakes from the same photo shoot, that might produce a near identical match, sharing the same human subject, similar lighting, backdrop, angle, etc. Lyft might have leaked your information somehow. I have heard that from my sister who took Lyft once and her driver started stalking her by messaging. She stopped using Lyft for good and just uses Uber. No it might have just been location suggestion people don't realize how much data sites like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook pull from you. I get suggestions from people I just started working with before without ever listing a place of work. Obviously driver is stalking you now This was a sort of ""scandal"" if you want to call it that, that was discovered a couple of years ago. Basically facebook, twitter, and all these other social media cancers are constantly monitoring everything you do and everywhere you go. They look at what wifi networks you connect to, your gps coordinates, what bluetooth devices you access, and they combine all of this information to build an activity list to pair you up with other people in the area. Basically they think any 2 people who might have been in the same walmart at the same time might want to get to know each other and so they recommend them as potential matches. Only 2 options:

1. You answered questions like: where’re you from, what school you attended to, where were you born, your last name (Drivers cannot see it unless you share it). That info is enough if you are using your real info on social networks.

2. If it was not a self-search made by the driver, so the problem is the info that you share on social media. And I don’t mean “your posts”, but that included in “Terms and conditions”. If you agreed them, for sure there was a paragraph that said: “allow us to use your live location to improve your experience in our social network”. Boom! They think you want to meet everyone you cross path with.

Solution: Stop sharing personal information to unknown people, and that includes social networks :)

Good luck! Did you talk to him or mention twitter/sm? I wouldn't worry about it probably a weird coincidence. 

I once found a pax on fbk based off of our conversation during the ride. Mainly to see if I could. Didn't add him tho. Would confronting him about it before even getting in be a problem? Cancel the ride?"
Someone pleas explain to me how 3 flights just landed yet the queue hasn’t moved at all.,50,77.00040384747639,Lyft,"I’m so sick of the airport man it seems so random and I’ve been skipped while sitting in the front of the queue before and lost hours of my time for nothing, there’s 1 person in front of me and 3 flights have landed yet the queue hasn’t moved up in 20 minutes, a lot of cars seem to be leaving the parking lot though?? Now I don’t have Uber and I know Uber is more popular but still seems shady and ridiculous to me.","do you use both uber and lyft? Maybe Uber is getting most of the requests?  I know some can make airports work for them, i do much better avoiding the queue lot. Only time i do it now, is if i want a break. Rematch means every single drop off cuts the line.  Queues are for suckers. 1) Rematch - don't know if lyft does this but uber does

2) when drivers get short trips from the airport they can return within 12h and skip the queue, so those drivers are cutting you in line If you're going to work the airport, definitely be registered with both apps. Only go to work the airport when it's at it's busiest, you'll get a ride right away, maybe even wait for a Long Ride or for surge. There are a couple apps, websites I use to help me coordinate at the airport. The airport queue is a scam. It’s not “wait your turn to get a ride” you’re basically in reserve. They’ll call you if they need you, but they probably won’t need you. Airport que is a scam. There should be a law that Uber/Lyft have to pay hourly in those lots. People go there to hang out with their buddies and pretend they're working. Rematch. Don’t wait in the AP queue. I think homeless, or nearly so, drivers only go to the airport for sleeping. It's not bad for earning while you sleep. Our Airport Queue, Philly works fine for both Uber and Lyft. If your Lyft ride is co suffered short ride, you can return to front of queue, and it’s the same with Uber.  When Uber is busy and you drop someone at airport, you can get a rematch. If no rematch you go into the queue but you are not out at front of queue.  On any given day Uber can move faster than Lyft and vice versa.  I do notice international flights produce higher demand on Uber.  Other than that it seems to be pretty even at the end of the week.   I only do XL and higher including Lux, SUV and Lux Blk and Lux Blk XL.  Sometimes it feels like I’m being bypassed but I’ve set with other drivers and positions Front to 5 in queue and it’s either planes coming in empty or no need for XL.  Also, if your counting arrivals make sure your not counting partnerd flights.  If you see same gate listed 5 times at same arrival time it’s usually as an example American with shared flights including British Airways Quantas Republic etc.  it’s all one flight listed 5 times. Don’t do airports! When I drop off, I take off my placard, drop in regular terminal traffic and then get the hell out of there. You want rides to the airport.  Rematch.  Had seven airport drops yesterday and rematched on all but 1.  Guess who?  Lyft.  When I was dumb and would wait in the lot I would be next in line and still wait 45 minutes with lyft.  Never again. 

Work on getting rides to airport instead.  Focus on higher end neighborhoods, hotels and passenger names.  Robert, Jim, Barbara, Cathy, Tom go to the airport.  Dylan, Conner, Alisha, Jesus go to their job at panda express.  

I live in a conference destination.  Find out when they end from pax or valet.  That's when you get airport rides. It takes time for people to walk off the plane and then collect their luggage and then walk outside/ to the pick up zone. How long after you wrote this did you get a ride? O'Hare is where it's at BBY. ;)

Never waited more than 25 for a ride, and now rematch is here. It depends on which Lyft city/hub you’re associated with.  I’m associated with the Silicon Valley hub and I experience the same BS you’re going through if I attempt to wait in the San Francisco airport que.  

Were you waiting in que at a different airport then your standard? What time did it happen? You have no idea how airports work lol"
Do drivers rate passengers?,19,77.13308903267263,Lyft,,"Yes, Lyft drivers have one day to rate passengers after the ride.  After a certain number of rides, this is averaged out to become your passenger rating.  Drivers see your passenger rating when your ride request comes up, and they decide to accept or deny the request. 

Some drivers will accept any rider rating (especially drivers trapped in their rental program that requires a high acceptance rate).  Other drivers may limit the minimum rider rating based on time of day or location.  For example, driver may accept riders with 4.7+ during the day but only for 4.8+ at night (safety concerns & some low-rated passengers are fine during the day but obnoxious drunks at night).  

However, accepting a 5.0 rider is a gamble. They could be an excellent passenger with all 5* rides or just as likely be a horrible passenger that got kicked off of Uber and just signed up for Lyft (not enough rides for an averaged rider rating). If your rating is to low, I decline your ride. Also keep your passangers (friends of rider requesting) in line. They act up, you take the rating hit. I have a pretty elaborate (and petty I'll admit) rating system. Basically, if you tip me and don't do anything dangerous or illegal, you will get five stars. If you don't tip me, I'll take a star off for anything that annoys me that you did. Given how badly lyft pays, I think it is justified. I will take ANY pax that I get and form my own star rating dependent on that trip. I ignore what their rating is. With this system 98 percent of my passengers are no problem at all. Those others get one to three star ratings and reported if necessary. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0509  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/71096) 1 star"

Taxi cab drivers using Lyft?,11,77.22216310675773,Lyft,Twice in Boston I’ve been picked up by actual taxi cab drivers while using Lyft. Is that allowed by Lyft or the taxi company they work for? It feels so weird as a passenger to be riding in a traditional taxi cab when I ordered a Lyft.,"It's against the Lyft terms of service. I think the real question here is if the cars picture and license plate match up with what's being reported by the app and if they don't why you're getting into the car in the first place.

If those details don't match up you don't get into the car.

You probably don't realize this but if anyone steals a drivers phone there is no password to protect the app. Anyone could use it. So this isn't just an insurance issue but also for your safety."

Best thing to do if in doubt is ask them their age. If they tell you under 18 then cancel. If they say 18, 19 or something but you still think they could be deceiving you ask them for prof of age or you cannot let them ride.

&#x200B;

Sadly a lot of parents are condoning letting their kids sign up for Ride Share accounts and using the parents Credit/Debit card to do so. Then the kids can just order  up a ride when they need one and the parents can be even more hands off raising their kids.

Remember to lie about your age they won't let you sign up if your under 18."" SMH if lyft / uber actually cared about this issue (and driver safety) they would require pax drivers license or ID in the app, and have the pax take photos of themself for verification (like drivers have to do occasionally) Also remember to deny rides when PAX dont have car seats! I've been told by many drivers that they just take the ride, but that's a hefty ticket, and negligent vehicular manslaughter if something does happen. Here in California its 4'9"" or 8 years old. I always ask age. Lyft: we care so much

Could I use a Lyft for a round trip without getting out of the car? Specifically, if I need to drop off my kids at school, and say my car won't start.  I know I can't send them in a Lyft alone (not that I would want to), so could I and the kids get in the Lyft together, get driven to the school, kids hop out, and the driver brings me back home?","Yes, with 2 stops. First stop, school. Second stop, back home. Happens every day, at least you are sensible enough to ride with them and ask here! you win PAX of day >>> I know I can't send them in a Lyft alone (not that I would want to) 

So sad so many don't see it this way, Just like those pax that are getting their “keys” from their friends just to get back home to go inside where their car is parked I guess. Drug deals, cig runs, beer runs, school runs all do this. Give the driver a $5 bill and tell them if it takes more than 5 mins wait, you’ll give them $1 a min. 

I normally cancel school runs as soon as I see them in the morning, they kill good runs to the airport or downtown. They go slow and we make most of our money with the wheels turning. And at the end, I’m in the same place as I started 30 - 45 mins earlier for $5

Cash up front makes me want to do them.

Do you really need rideshare insurance to ride for Lyft or is that just a BS rhetoric so they can grab more money from you?,5,78.8957973660639,Lyft,,"You need to get a rideshare endorsement from your OWN insurance company since you’re going to use your vehicle for rideshare.

Rideshare insurance is what covers this possibility. Who is ""they""? If you're referring  to Lyft, they have nothing to do with rideshare insurance and couldn't care less of you have any. Rideshare insurance is to cover you when at work (rideshare app on) and before the Lyft insurance kicks in (passenger in car). To RIDE, no.  To DRIVE, yes. Get it. It's worth it. I got hit with a pax in the car and got a free rental car for 30 days while my car was in the shop, and zero deductible (the other guy's insurance paid for hitting me).

This is, by far, the best fare I’ve received in the 12 months I’ve driven for Lyft. Rush hour, LAX to Irvine, CA. How is the base fare $0.00? Don’t y’all have a base? What’s up w the $0.00 base fare? 😰 Nice. Last trip to LAX, it took nearly me 2 hours to go up and 2 hours back down to Irvine. Pax and her 2 kids didn't even leave a cent tip after I helped them with luggage. On top of that, I got a 3* - probably pax got mad because she got charged waiting time after taking 10 minutes to say goodbyes to everyone. I'll tell you what I told my own Mom, no trip to LAX is worth it Nice I'm jealous of the 40 miles per hour.  I got stuck in LAX to Hollywood bullsh*t, maybe 15 mph. I picked up a Television producer, he actually asked me if I prefer lyft to Uber and I tell him ""Uber is better in traffic because Lyft only pays 6 bucks an hour to sit in traffic"" hint hint .  I checked about 2 hours after droppoff and he didn't tip so I 4 starred him, I was going to drop him to 3 a few hours later but he threw a $5er my way so I 5 stared him.   He literally made more money on the phone during the 1 hour trip than I did all day, but thanks for the fiver you're expensing anyway. What is the 'bonuses' section? As much as I dread going to the airport during busy times, it’s usually a good money maker as long as the rematch is a longer ride on the way out. Yeah, you can get those nice rides to from airports every so often especially if they are on a business trip. Then they don't care because they just expense it Well if he has to return empty it certainly not worth it gas for that trip is at-least 10$ I mean if the dude hadnt tipped you 24$ this would be a trash fare"

Lyft Is Better Than Uber,10,79.12593625496659,Lyft,"I've been using Uber since I moved to Orlando, Florida about a year ago. Mainly because they had a monthly pass deal where you would lock in a reasonable rate all day regardless of rate fluctuations for everyone else. And now that Lyft has the same thing basically, I'm switching over. Ubers whole setup sucks. The drivers using it can't find you either because the map just recalculates over and over and the driver is too, sorry to say, dumb to just use common sense and turn. So even ""calling"" an Uber early for work, takes 20 minutes longer because my driver won't stop listening to the map recalculate 45 times. But EVERY TIME I've used Lyft....smooth as butter. I get to work on time, I get home quick, and the routes are even more efficient. And this is cars that have the Uber and Lyft stickers in their windshield. My big question is how are some drivers going brain dead when they pick up someone using Uber and suddenly they are The Transporter when they pick up with Lyft?","Rider expectations. 

Also, they are the same drivers on both apps. they are both terrible if you are a driver.

which is better, uber of Lyft?

its like being forced to eat two separate pieces ofShit and then trying to say which one is better You just got a good driver on Lyft and a bad driver via Uber. Most drivers use a third-party app for navigation anyways so that has nothing to do with it because most drivers use both apps. Lyft has a $2,500 deductible if your driver gets in a fender-bender while on the app, versus $1,000 deductible for Uber.  Also, they've dropped their per-mile rate to well below the IRS rate of 58 cents a mile in some markets (without passing savings on to passengers).  Lyft's actions suggest that they literally hate drivers.  I won't sign up to drive for Lyft."

I personally like working those hours. I stay away from downtown, PB, and OB around 2 when the bars let out. Around 4ish you start getting airport rides. My experience in San Diego you're a rare breed.. someone that isn't trashing Lyft & Uber.. hats off to you :-) New driver?  They tend to ply with highly profitable rides at the start to reel you in.

Can Lyft drivers use fake names?,13,79.78342468091459,Lyft,"Can Lyft drivers make it so a fake name is displayed for them? I'm looking through my ride history, and it's showing a ride with a fellow named ""Quick Therapy"" which I somehow doubt is his real name. I'm also quite sure that wasn't the name showing when I took the ride or I would have cancelled and complained. Lyft support says that is indeed the name showing and that it was ""approved at the request of the driver."" Is this allowed? Surely not, but apparently so.","I will decline any ambiguous or obvious fake names. End of story. I'm pretty sure you can. I've thought about looking into it simply because people are always getting my first name wrong, and it's just unusual enough that if someone wanted to look me up on Facebook by my first name and region, they could probably find me, and then learn my last name, etc. (Actually, maybe I WILL request a nickname, come to think of it. . . )  
Anyway, Quick Therapy is kind of an unusual nickname, but I could see Lyft giving approval on it. They still have the driver's real name and other data on file if there's an issue, just as they do for the passengers I've picked up whose Lyft profile names were ""J"", ""Dawg"", and ""Nobody."" You can use nicknames...but you have to contact support to do it and your real name is still tied to the account."
Silly question: does tipping in cash negatively affect rider score?,9,79.92165384758125,Lyft,"I very rarely have cash on me in general but I’m gonna make more of an effort to have cash on hand to tip. Drivers get that tip right away (as opposed to having to await payout from Lyft); it sounds like some drivers have experienced Lyft jilting them out of tips; and drivers can avoid paying taxes on tips if they’re given in cash. 
 
My silly question: does tipping in cash negatively affect my rider score? 
 
I only ask because I’m assuming the app/Lucy’s company info keeps track of tipping by riders and that seems like someone (a driver or a Lyft employee or some algorithm) could knock my score if it seems like I’m not regularly tipping.","As a driver we can't see your tip history. tipping in cash will ensure u get 5 stars most likely. Cash is king! That saying still holds true. I always like a cash tip. 5 stars ⭐️ 

Drivers rate you, not Lyft. Lyft only disciplines your account. Lyft (the app/company) doesn't care if you tip or not. It doesn't impact you there. The only thing it can impact is how driver's rate you. Thank you all for your answers and info! Nope, plus, most drivers have the same view as the church; cash washes away most of your sins. 

Just depends on how much washing is needed. While I prefer in-app tip, just for the sake of convenience, I always give a five to everyone, even the douche shouting on his phone the whole ride, though maybe that one was a mistake. A cash tip probably guarantees a five-star, because we don't usually see tips until later, after drop-off, when it's most convenient for us to rate you.  If you're getting five-star drivers, you're probably a five-star yourself. Some of the more prominent introduction material for drivers emphasizes the importance of always giving five-star ratings, deferring to our judgement for when a passenger has clearly gone out of their way to cause problems, which for me, has been literally never. I almost always rate my cash tippers 5 stars. For me at least, if you weren’t a *terrible* passenger, you get five stars, tip or not."
Acceptance rating,8,80.01644551425896,Lyft,"Does acceptance rating matter now? 
I had both lyft and Uber on, had an Uber request, in the middle of route got a lyft request which I let go. When I opened the lyft app it said not accepting requests lowers acceptance rating.  Doing research here, post from a year or two ago says acceptance rating doesn’t matter. Any update on it.  
TIA","It does if you want to see the approximate trip time and direction.  Other than that I don't think so Some bonuses are tied to it, but if you dont have any you are pursuing then it is meaningless. Lyft just warns you because as you can see it's working, you're scared something is going to happen to you even though you dont know what. Thats the way lyft treats you. I always log out of whatever app I’m not currently giving a ride on and run both when waiting on requests. By logging out of the app your not giving the ride on will keep your acceptance rate high on both platforms. You should have turned off driver mode in one app as soon as you get a request in the other."
"Family member left iPhone in Lyft 2 days ago, driver refuses to respond to request for lost item - any recourse?",130,80.0634362549997,Lyft,"A family member left their iPhone in their Lyft home on Saturday and realized it Sunday AM.  They tracked the phone and saw it drive to the airport and then to another area in town so we assume it's still in the driver's car.  

He reached out to Lyft who sent a message to the driver but he hasn't responded to them for 48 hours.  I assume at this point he knows he has the phone in question but is trying to sell it or wipe it.  The phone was put into ""Lost mode"" already but by now the battery is dead.

Is there anything he can do to retrieve the phone at this point?  Is there any recourse or can a driver just go MIA and keep a lost item?","You know there's a possibility that one of the pax took the phone a few rides down the line. I've had someone lose a phone in my car a while back, it wasn't until a few rides later that on of my pax found it and told me about it. I reported it to Uber and after a few minutes pax reached out to me. So I'm saying that another pax might have taken it. The driver is under no obligation to return a found item Did he have findmyiphone turned on?

Should be able to go to icloud.com, login, and find it. Dude, a passenger left something in my car the other day too. I got a text message from him about it. He initially wanted me to drop it off, but was kinda far, so we eventually agreed to just have me drop it off at the local Lyft office (which he was more than happy with), and had Lyft contact him directly to arrange delivery/pickup...end of story.

For all those that say the driver doesn't owe ish, c'mon man, don't be a douche. Imagine if it were you that left your phone in that car. Would you just say oh well, it's all my fault and never expect to see it again? Just sayin... This comes up often so here's the easiest and fastest way to get lost property returned.

Money...

You need to offer a good amount of money upfront ($100+) to the driver to make it worth their time and effort to make your lost phone their priority.

The $15 offered by Uber/Lyft is not going to get any drivers attention and they will just ignore you until a good offer rolls in or they trash your phone somewhere.

You are going to spend $150+ on an insurance deductible or the cost of a new phone plus the time and effort to get it replaced anyways.

Neither Uber nor Lyft have any responsibility to get you your property returned and they won't do anything to a driver who is simply ignoring you. The driver may use a second phone as his ""Lyft phone"" other than his personal phone, and he may not have driven on Sunday. He might have even gone out of town for a bit and left his second phone at home. Sometimes the messages from Lyft don't come through immediately, so he may not have seen the message when you assume he did, if he's even seen it yet. The phone may not be in the driver's car anymore, but he may not have been the one to remove it. A passenger may have found it and pocketed it. So, imagine that the driver doesn't even look at his second phone to see Lyft's message until last night or this morning, goes out to the car and looks for your phone, and doesn't find it. He sends a message back to Lyft saying he didn't find a phone. By the time Lyft gets this message, the person who opened your ticket is no longer working, and somebody else has to pick up the ball to let you know, which, frankly, could take a while. So, before you assume that your driver is some shady guy trying to sell your phone on the black market, understand that he's got a life separate from Lyft, the ""moral responsibility"" for returning someone else's forgotten item does not have a time limit, and the lines of communication between Lyft and the drivers and between Lyft and the customers isn't as direct as you may think it is. I have gone through hell to return stuff to people that left their belongings in my car. One time I found a wallet un my car contacted Uber and they wanted me to wait and hold on to it. I got the girls name off of her I'd and contacted her on Facebook to let her know I had it.i never cared about a fee I just know what it feels like to loose my stuff and have people not return of worse steal stuff before they turn it in. If you dont care about people dont do this job. Recourse? Buy a new phone and pay attention next time. It sucks that you lost it, but the driver may not even have it. People leave things, and riders often just take it. 

I tested it out once with three fake wallets after me and a friend got bored and wanted to test a theory we had. I wanted to see if people would steal or actually return it, and sadly all three times it got stolen. The wallet had fake money, so jokes on them, but still.. 

so yeah, whatever happened to your phone, don't jump to conclusions due to no data on the full scope of it. He might be a dick, or may not have and has stopped caring to respond. This is why I ask every single rider if they have their phone when they exit. Every single one thanks me. No way in Hell I want to put up with this kind of shit from worst case scenario assuming pax who forgot their phone. If I did find a phone, I would head straight to the nearest Police station and drop it off in lost and found. Drunk pax left a phone in my car once and was completely rude to me the whole trip, haven't even searched for it in my car til I vacuumed like two days later. That's how little importance I care for rude drunkies Tbh lyft usually doesn't even give the driver the 'return fee' Keep up with your shit. The other day I returned a passport for UBer and got nothing out it. It amazes me that someone wyd ignore Lyft.   Besides, what’s this drivers end game.  Return the phone.  Go to police and have them contact Lyft.  Curious what happens if you go to police.   How will this be handled.  I be found phones and other items. Always returned them.  Returning lost items is the right thing to do.  It’s why Lyft and Uber treat us the way they do. This person left their iPhone 6 in my car yesterday. But the person also told me that I was a terrible person for not hating gays and that I was the problem with this country for being a nice person. Then she ranted on about trump doing the right thing about keeping my kind out of the country and how if I can’t do anything productive that I should leave. 

Should I be a proper human being and return the phone? 

I probably will, gonna send it to the hub and report the Incident.

But we all know uber/Lyft will be like “we’ll take action cause this is not allowed on our platform” but in reality they don’t tell their passenger anything. 

Just wanted to get my thoughts out there :) 1) keep track of ur stuff better
2) there's literally nothing you can do
3) that driver will get what's coming to him, don't worry


Sorry to hear.  If it makes you feel any better, I had some Pax steal my wallet, and Lyft couldn't do shit then either. If you leave your phone on a bus the driver is under no obligation to return it to you. If you leave your phone on an airplane the pilot is under no obligation to return it to you. Don’t leave your phone behind. I had someone leave their phone in my car after doing a 2am bar pickup. Bitch puked in my car and didnt even apologize for it or thank me for the ride. I went home to clean and charge her for the mess, which was when I found the phone. Had to work at 9 am at my other job. Bitch shows up to my place of work with a cop and demands I return her phone while I'm still on the clock. It hadn't even been 8 hours since the incident and she fucking tracks me. Next time, I will definitely toss that shit out if the passenger doesn't call me within 15 min after the ride ends. Dont leave your shit in your uber drivers car. Why do you assume the driver has it?

Maybe the driver doesn't have it, but just doesn't feel like talking to you about it.

After all, we are not employees, we are independent contractors

We were contracted to take you from point A to point B

We did our job

We are not obligated to do any more than that.

Our job is over.

A driver CAN get back to you if you call them, but they are not required to do so.

I mean, uber/lyft do not want to give us employee rights or benefits, so if we are not employees, the minute we finish our fair, our job is done

We are not obligated to follow up with you, or help you in your search for your personal lost items. I dropped passengers off at Phillies game.  I went out of my way within 15 minutes to return to stadium. The passenger and his friends were probably 20 years old.  I believe in doing right thing and hoping these young people will remember and pay it forward on their life.   Than again I’m retired from 30 plus years in business. Actually the wireless industry.  Drivers wonder why they get no respect.  This is definitely a reason.   I dunno maybe I was raised different. I’m 60 and I hope being a good person and doing right thing is a life lesson for those I’ve had as passengers.   It’s unfortunate some drivers don’t really care. Not returning a trackable item is not smart.  It’s obvious to Lyft.  Gives rest of us bad name.   Besides, Lyft pays $15.   I’m sure the passenger would have conveniently met the driver almost anywhere."

Left iPhone in backseat of Lyft,7,80.42598255130704,Lyft,"I left my iPhone in the back seat of a Lyft ride. The driver realized I left the item and contacted Lyft. He also called my coworker from a missed call on the lock screen to let him know he had my phone. Left provided me with the driver's email and phone number. Not having a phone I emailed asking when and where a convenient time to meet up would be. The driver informed me he was at an amusement park and would be available at a specific time. When that time came around I emailed again asking if we could meet up or if he'd be willing to come to my address. He never responded. I then contacted Lyft asking them to reach out to the driver, still no response. I even offered to pay for the return in addition to the $15 return fee, and still no response. I've been polite and patient in the matter but now I'm getting desperate. Should I contact the police at this point? Lyft will not release any personal info about the driver. They also say he is not liable for the item, but he has admitted to having it via a phone call to my coworker, an email to Lyft and an email to me. I just want my item back, I was willing to pay for it and meet on his time.","Don't expect him to jump through hoops because you're desperate, you left the phone in his car and he did all the right things by attempting to call your coworker and responding to Lyft. Now it's his time off and when he's ready to meet you, he will. Try to be patient, don’t email or call him none stop and just be ready to meet, I don’t think he plans to keep it or anything .

Sounds like the guy has kids and other things going on in his life, give him a little time at least 48 hours. The entitlement of passengers is astonishing. Really pissy that Lyft gave you his private # and e mail. Never should happen. Maybe he got deactivated or suspended. Calling the police would be a dick move. This driver has done nothing wrong and doesn't deserve unwanted police contact. The driver should communicate with passenger. If you lost your phone, you would want it back ASAP.  The driver could drop it at any police station ad make it easy for passenger to claim their phone.  Let’s be real and do the right thing regardless of obligation."

(These rides are ofcourse not in my ride history in the app on my phone because I never took these rides.) Lyft risk department replied to my emails saying they could not find the charges.  I cancelled my card but why can't Lyft find these charges they were paid for? I am concerned that someone somehow used my account, but why these rides don't show in my ride history since they were charged to my card is puzzling. I went back 3 months in my ride history. I was also at the same location for days, and I sent Lyft screenshots of my ride history showing my last ride before these unknown charges with the date, time, to and from address, driver's name etc. That should have been enough to prove these rides were no taken by me.","Your card is compromised.

"Is express drive worth it in Dallas, TX?",11,80.77016079205882,Lyft,"Hello, new driver here. Got laid off and planning to drive lyft full time. Just seeking feedback to see which is more worth it.

Currently the app shows I will only have to pay $169 if I hit 55 rides $149 for 65 rides and $89 for 80 rides. How hard is it to accomplish the # of rides requirement? 

How many hours did you have to put in to get the minimum 55 rides and is it worth it, or is it better to just use personal car if my aim to to only hit the bare minimum?

My car is hybrid with 60 mpg. But the monthly payment is $400 for 7 years. It's only 3 month old with 3000 miles. It means i still have 6 years and 9 months to pay. Is this better than renting?

Appreciate all your help. Thank you","I can't really vouch for any details or anything from the Texas area, but if there's one thing I've learned from this sub, it's that everyone should avoid express drive completely. Express drive is worth it NOWHERE  I did the express drive in the Dallas area about a year ago, I would say if you have your own car definitely use it if your gonna do this long term otherwise you will find yourself chasing rides to try and pay for the rental , And it will get frustrating.. You can definitely get rides all day but alot of those are really spread out and take alot of time ..good for the cost of the ride but if your trying to hit bonuses by ride count it slows you down .. If your just curious try it for maybe a week to get a feel for it .. it's not as easy as people think.. Express Drive is fine if you don't have a car or if you don't want to put the miles and wear on your own vehicle. But with your own car you can and should sign up for Lyft, Uber, Postmates, etc. to maximize your time. Check out courier companies in your area, too. No Well think about it 55 rides.  Hopefully you can average $10 a ride.  550.00 now subtract 169.00 plus gas.  Half your money is gone and you still have to make a car payment.

No matter how you do it, it's a bad idea to start rideshare.  Your new car is probably gonna be taking on 2500 miles a month.  People that do rideshare full-time with 7 year loans, run out of car before they run out the loan balance.

You'll hate yourself for doing it after 6 months to a year and look at that odometer.

Friends don't let friends drive Uber or Lyft. Your car is a little too new for rideshare but stay away from the rental if you can. First of all, when you receive those rental bonuses, you r still paying taxes on them. On top of that, u don’t get the per mileage deduction on the rental. Oh and not to mention the mid size sedans they rent out are terribly gas inefficient.

Instead, use your hybrid and try to hit the weekly bonuses. Use those extra bonus incomes towards your car payments. Collect the deductible miles and save money on gas at the same time.

That’s pretty much what I did after doing express rental for 7months. I started driving for Lyft in October(Dallas). The first couple months were great, got lured into doing it full-time and then it’s slowly gotten worse. I used to make $200-250/ night from 5pm-3am on Fri + Sat nights. 
This past weekend I made $70 on Friday and decided I’m done driving yesterday.
I use the Lyft passenger app to identify where other drivers are and the market is just over saturated with drivers.
Good Luck! ;) Do not use this program in Dallas. I used it for close to a year and trust me...it will never add up in your favor. unless you’re in a huge city that keeps you busy all day where it’s request after another, then it may be worth it. I’d say try for a month or so with your car and see how well are you doing, if you like it then try the express, if not then just stick doing it with your car. 90% of people who tried express complains about it, though I have couple friends in Seattle loving its can’t really tell Can’t speak to the Dallas market, but if you have your own car you should definitely use it. Otherwise you’re paying your regular car payment for a vehicle that’s just sitting there AND you’re paying the express drive fees. Plus in most markets express drive folks get paid less than people with their own cars, so you’re screwing yourself even more. I get paid 11 cents less per mile than non-express drivers. If I drive 100 miles a day 6 days a week, that’s a lot of money I’m forfeiting. I try not to think about it. 

Keep in mind that you’ll need rideshare insurance for your own car and you need to track all your mileage and expenses for taxes."
"Best schedule for Rancho Cucamonga/Fontana, CA",7,80.89685060688467,Lyft,"Hello, 

Lyft driver here. I have recently moved there and I noticed there aren't that many rides around compared to the ones closer to Los Angeles like Downey. It seems to be almost dead around the afternoon in the weekends. For those that have worked around the area, what is the best schedule? I work only on weekdays Monday-Friday from 9 to 6pm.","Early Sunday mornings are a good bet and will get you rides to the airports, most likely LAX or John Wayne.  You won’t get any rides back, so just hang out and pick up some local rides near the airport. Consider being flexible with the schedule and working outside the hours you established if possible. Nights n weekends demand is definitely high. Regardless of where you live, try starting earlier maybe by 4:30 am and set your destination to LAX, and you'll definitely get rides that way. Also, try using Uber and Lyft at the same time. Uber can get you closer to downtown or LAX, and you will get more Lyft rides from there. Scope out the festivals. August 3&4 HARD Summer will be at the Fontana speedway. 3-11 I believe. Cash in on it, there will be tons of rides in, and madness of primetime after. For hours. Best of luck! Drive to l.a. or orange county. Often you'll spend too much time chasing smaller fares in the ie and its always sporadic. Downtown l.a. or driving down Wilshire was always a safe bet for me Fontaki? Thanks everyone, helpful comments. I just started driving for the night and I do get some rides around the area. At least more than the afternoon. By the airport what time in the morning would you usually recommend? Also is it best to filter the airport from home or get to the airport and wait for a request?"
"Don’t use lyft a lot, is there a way to check my rating?",10,81.4902765328106,Lyft,I’m a passenger not a driver,Lyft has way more..not all..but way more pax who are either broke or looking for cheap rides. They tend to be way more rude and a lot of them are ghetto people. Not saying you are one of them...I an sure they also have a lot of wonderful pax. But lyft is like the Walmart of rideshare so lyft hires the pax rating to not make them feel bad and furthermore ask for even more credits upon seeing their low rating.

Will you give a pax 4 stars just because they don't tip?,28,81.76276495876135,Lyft,"During many of my rides the passenger will be on the phone and ask me to turn down the radio or ask me to turn up the AC, or follow their directions instead of GPS. Passengers can be pretty demanding which I don't have a problem with. But sometimes I expect a small tip when they have all these demands, which seems to never happens. I've never done it but I was just wondering if anyone has given a pax a 4 star rating because of being demanding and not giving a tip. I've thought about doing it but it doesn't seem fair","I wouldn't. For me, the ones who end up tipping are the ones who actually dont request anything.

Random tip: A woman yesterday tipped me $22 for a 2 mile ride because she thought I was allergic to her perfume because I sneezed lol. I always tip in the app after the ride is done. Are drivers able to see that? 5,000 rides here. I will 4 star most non-tippers, but I make case by case exceptions. If it was a nondescript,  normal non-tipper, I don't 3-star or below because I need the rides, and the more people I'm not able to be paired with, the further I'll have to drive to pick-ups. I figured that was standard to a 4 star a no tipper. Haha that's interesting. What I've noticed is that the people who tip are usually the people that don't use lyft a lot or the people that have a conversation with you. You should so u can let other drivers know what type of passenger it is. 4 stars gives em a 4.9 so it isn't that bad Entirely fair. Yep... as I see it If you tip for a beer from a barman then you should tip your lift driver something, I automatically four star anyone who doesn't tip regardless of how good a pax they were. Sure. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3939  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/42023) Fair? Here’s what you should consider doing. Any passenger that does not tip you within 24 hours of getting dropped off gets an automatic 3 stars - even if they were wonderful. Why? They don’t tip and you’d prefer not to be matched with them again. 
Requires an extra 30 minutes max to be diligent about going through your rides while you have access to change their rating. 
Don’t feel bad, they can’t see their ratings anyway. 4?

4?

No tip, you get 1 starred every time. 

You give me unsolicited route directions, I cancel the ride. If u demand for me to go ur way that's a automatic 1 star I hate back seat drivers"
Viewing Whole Trip Map,4,81.79997560690951,Lyft,"New driver here, is there a way to view the whole trip before you accept the ride?  My friend said it activates when you accept 90% but I have accepted 100% with 30+ rides and still can't see it.

Yes When your acceptance rate is over 90%, you are able to view trip length if it’s 30+ minutes, 45+ minutes and direction you will be traveling.  Sometimes app will say long trip.   This is what I see when I am pinged with long trips.  I’m Lux Black XL driver and I have 96% acceptance rate.  I do not do share or regular Lyft.  My app is set on slow days to XL LUX LUXBlack and LUXBLACKxl.  On peak I set app to Black and Black XL only.  I see enough info.  All my long trips are usually LUX LUXBLACK AND LUXBLACKXL.

How long do you usually wait at the airport before it’s not worth it?,43,81.95253347729091,Lyft,I know it’s different for each market but for me once I’ve sat here for 90 minutes I’m pissed,"90 minutes good god. I don't wait more then 5 after I drop someone off. Airports are for suckers 20 minutes max. I would advise you to add the corresponding airport to your home screen to see if it's going to be busy or not. [airport departures arrivals list](https://airport-departures-arrivals.com).
Also don't make it your mission while driving to go to the airport or catch multiplied pricing, you end up driving a lot and waiting a lot and finally get a 2.5x only to add $7 extra. The unicorn rides could come anytime, anyplace. If I don't have a ping waiting for me as I'm dropping off, I leave. Airports are for suckers Plus I do that without worrying about bar crowds or even motioning rush hour lol. Work smarter and harder. Only way to make money is owning not financing a premium black car. I’m retired and I have two cars that are both black premium. A sedan and 7 passenger SUV.  I also do UBER BLACK.   

I get rides to Trenton , Princeton , King of Prussia , AC etc.  just in my own area I drive passengers to Kennedy in NY.  Even if I cone back early and in an XL or Lux ride I’m make big dollars.  A Princeton lux only paid me over a $100 net profit.  

I took the time to learn how PHL works arrivals and departures.  Once you learn you will know when to be at Airport. It’s a system that works.  If I bring in $200-300 I promise you in many cases my milage is half of my gross earnings. If your driving a 100 to make 100 or 200 to make 200 than your killing your car. I don’t wait at airports because I don’t go to airports. The airport queue is a scam. Do not go in. Lyft will still prioritize the driver that’s closest rather than the drivers in the queue who have waited their turn. They will match up drivers with another ride when they’re dropping a passenger off and also drivers who are near the airport. The queue is just a reserve of drivers. It works out well for lyft because this way they have a parking lot full of drivers who they can summon if they need them but if not, they don’t have to pay them."

As a solo rider do you prefer if I use shared or an individual Lyft?,11,82.47362144028975,Lyft,"So I needed an hour ride home today from the airport and they said shared would be $65 and solo Lyft would be $70. 

I didn't mind $5 or a detouring an extra 10 minutes and thought I'd be helping out the driver if I picked pool, that he'd maybe get a few more passengers going in that direction and wouldn't have to drive an hour with one person.

We ended up picking up nobody. And he was nice (I was mostly sleeping) but at the end of the ride he didn't seem that happy about having to drive someone that long (I asked him if he'd prefer me being dropped off half way and ordering another Lyft cause I honestly don't know what drivers prefer and he said he didn't mind).

I asked him about it and he said that pool would take a lot of what I paid as fees and he'd only make $22 giving me the ride or something because it was a pool and Lyft takes more of a cut because of it. It just made me feel guilty for picking pool cause I thought I was helping him out doing so! He said something like he'd normally get 35 for that ride if I didn't pick pool so I tipped him more than I would have normally cause I felt bad about having him drive so far but that was a hefty bill at the end of the day after that tip..

I was wondering in the future should I pick pool at all? Usually it's only 2-3$ cheaper on my end so if they really take that much shouldn't I just stick to solo? Also do you guys prefer longer drives or shorter ones? 


Thanks! Sorry I'm a Lyft newbie but I'll be using it a lot in the next few months for some traveling and was just wondering!","We get paid for time and distance no matter what ride you pick. What you pay has no bearing on what we get. The only difference is each solo rider nets us an extra small fee (in my area it’s $1.50) but in a pool we only get that for the first rider. *could* Lyft give us a bigger share of what you pay? Absolutely. But that’s not the way it works right now and your driver was wrong. (Back when Lyft first started drivers kept 80% of what a rider paid and Lyft kept 20%. Then they lowered it to 75/25. Then they scrapped that model altogether and switched to what we have now.)

Preferences depend on the driver. Personally I’ll take whatever comes my way, and I prefer short rides to long ones, but there are plenty of people who are the opposite. Lyft is *supposed* to give us a heads up if the ride is longer than 45 minutes but it’s inconsistent. As for shared/pool rides, they’re a crapshoot. Sometimes they work out and you get decent people and make money, other times Lyft tells you to get off the highway and go back 15 minutes in the direction you just came from, then go way the hell out of your way again, and it just wastes everyone’s time because it’s wildly inefficient routing. 

If you can afford the difference, just take a solo ride and avoid the hassle. Most drivers will care more that you’re at the pickup spot ready to go when they arrive and you’re not obnoxious when you get in. If you pick up four shared riders at the same location and drop them of at the same location the riders all pay the normal value but the driver only gets his usual cut for one rider. Only noobs support the shared/pool system. [deleted] Tip the driver well on a long ride since they will have to travel without a rider on the way back. 

Many people don’t like shared rides since it’s usually cheaper pax so they don’t tip, but it’s not always true. If it’s slow I will take em. 

Prefer shorter rides. Next time swipe right and order an xl or lux instead. You’ll probably save yourself a cpl bucks and will certainly have a better, more comfortable passenger experience. Driver gets paid by time and distance. Theoretically shared ride should net driver more money since the ride will continue longer and less time driving without passenger. But that may also mean less number of total rides and more time sitting idle. That’s it"
Does anyone still get Ride Challenges in the LA/OC area ?,3,82.58063532917863,Lyft,"Shortly after Lyft switched me from power driver bonus to the Ride challenge 10 months ago, slowly, week after week the challenges decreased in rewards then disappeared completely.","It’s a game of constantly diminishing returns sadly!

"Damage to my car, Lyft doesn't pay enough",6,82.65496403289613,Lyft,"Hello, everybody. I've been driving for Lyft for over a year now and I am am the breaking point when it comes to their customer service and how to deal with passengers. We deal with the public and it doesn't always go well. 

Recently, I had a passenger literally make deep scratches on the interior dome of my car. I'm not sure how or why she did it but it is clear, unmistakable damage and I know which passenger did it. I reported her as soon as I saw the damage and took multiple pictures and started the exchange with customer service. 

When I checked my account, I saw they put in $100 for damages. This is not okay. I haven't even gotten a chance to get it officially assessed but the few I talked to already have estimated $250-300. This is absolutely unacceptable! How is Lyft going to allow a passenger to vandalize my car and leave ME with the majority of the BILL?!

Hey guys! New driver here and I have lots of questions! Any tips!?,22,83.14301958845998,Lyft," Just to preface, I started 4 days ago. I'd like to also note that i'm in a *very small* market, a population of about 72k people; and Uber was here about a year and a half before Lyft, so a lot of people are using that  :(. Things are going alright for me. In about 13 hrs, i've made $133 dollars (not counting cash tips). So I'm averaging about 10-11 dollars and hours right now.   


Now, with that out of the way, i'll ask some questions:

* How does Lyft decide who gets rides? Is it generally the closest driver to the request?
* How much driving are you willing to do to get back to a high traffic area?
* What makes you decide to cancel on a ride? I've accepted every ride so far, and i've been canceled on once (they canceled within like, 20 seconds O.o)
* What do you do to pass time in between rides? I'm using just watching shows on my phone...should I be driving around (and possibly wasting gas)?
* Is there anything that you do that has increased the amount of tips you get? I just try to be nice, and have good conversation...I don't offer snacks and drink like i've seen some other drivers do.
* If you're a part timer (like me). How much do you drive outside of your normal job? Do you worry about burnout?  

* Do you play music  for passengers, or keep it quiet? Do people ( in general) seem to have a preference?  


I'd really appreciate some insight from the peep in this sub. Thanks!","How much driving for a part timers 

I drive Friday Saturday from 7:00pm til 12 midnight unless it’s really busy then I go til 2:00am because I have stuff to do around the house the next day

Other tips
Be nice say thank you for riding with Lyft or Uber

Over 6000 rides maybe 5 cancels
The pax may be having a bad day
Nobody’s perfect

Keep your car very clean
Use fabreeze to clean up the air 

I have Sirius radio so I usually give pax a choice or have them google the channel they want to hear Im barely part time anymore but i guess anything under 40hours is part time right? I do close to 8 hours a week. Basically I turn on the app after 5pm when i get off work and I am able to get the bonuses. If i start at 4pm for instance, i get shit and really avoid it. 

&#x200B;

Essentially i do rides that get me closer to home. 

&#x200B;

The Pros: It forces me to keep my car clean, i cant state this enough. I leave nothing behind in my car now and thats been nice. The money i make pays for gas and parking where i work, nothing else. When theres lots of traffic it helps getting into the HOV lane and also conversations are 9/10 nice. One other thing that is more abstract is the fact that now I am a lot more cognizant of how much money I spend on food, that $10 meal means two trips for me now and that equates to 20 to 30 minutes of my time. I think it has been valuable to see how easy we can burn money on little things. 

&#x200B;

The cons: Generally i am home later than I would have if i just drove home. the pay is less than minimum wage, If i made more i would drive longer. Sitting down all day at work plus the drive does a number on you for sure. I always feel like all i am doing is taking money away from what my car is worth towards my checking account. Essentially my car's wear and tear is the byproduct of the couple of hundred bucks I pocket each month. So its like I am moving money from one pocket to the other without actually moving up.

Hope this helps, feel free to ask anything else you may need. I used to drive a lot more before but after 2 months , I tapped out Best tip you can get : don’t drive for Lyft ! Quit now. Best tip you’ll ever get. Scroll through some previous posts for a better perspective. 

Do you have rideshare insurance? Let’s start there. Quit Here’s my tip... do something else. 

Why? Anyone jumping on board NOW is part of the problem. 
Don’t take this as a personal attack, it isn’t... but it’s sending the wrong message to Lyft, and it only brings rates for existing drivers lower over time because Lyft thinks ‘well ants are still signing up and willing to pay us to drive people around, so let’s charge drivers more and lower pay outs.’ 


The driver pay rate is now a net loss proposition for new drivers, especially for the drivers using their own cars.  It may not appear that way but look past the $10\hr ish on your statement and consider that this only accounts for time you have PAX in the car with you. When you factor in the time driving around looking for requests and the time and distance to pick PAX up, it will cost you to drive.."
Driving for Lyft while commuting,8,83.22106356995249,Lyft,So I was wondering if it makes sense to sign up to drive for lyft. I would only do rides on my way to and from my work. I commute about 45min to/from work and figure it could be a little extra side cash if I could get occasional rides but not sure if financially it’s worth it. Thoughts? Recommendations? Thanks!,"I do it but it works better with Uber where there's more riders thus more likely that you will get someone goijng your way.

I also happen to work in downtown and go home about 4miles away which ensures I legit pass thru all of the city so that also increases my chances.

I'm in Portland a semi expensive market and I am pulling about $80~ a week. The rides are necessarily directly my way but they don't leave me much further away from my destination.

One huge benefit is that I do a lot of prime time drives because demands jumps up drastically at 5pm. 


Is it worth it? Not in the morning since I am assuming you have to be at work at a certain time. You could be stuck in traffic taking someone and been late for work.

On the way home is a different story, you may add some stress to your life by sitting in the car longer than you need to but the cash is good to pay for gas and lunch meals that's how I see it. You have little to no control over where your rider wants to go or how long it takes. You can use what's called destination mode to theoretically get rides towards your destination but you will probably get bad rides or no rides. I doubt this would go well. Well I would definitely be doing destination mode on the way to work... it’s like a hit or miss sometimes... I would try it out and see what you think... if you get a full 45 minute ride, that could be $30+ each time you drive to work ... for perspective, I just made $77 for driving someone from San Francisco to Stockton (1 hour 15 minute, 72 mile drive)... try it, you may like it, you might not... but definitely 100% use destination mode when driving to work This is actually one of the FEW examples of when it makes PERFECT sense. You already have a job and you are ALREADY making the commute and paying all the bills associated so ANYTHING you make is pure gravy.

In my market (Miami) I find Uber is more popular (approx 80% of my business) - possibly due to it's international marketing reach (Uber is in 100 countries , Lyft is USA and toronto) 

Ideally, if you are doing the standard Mpn- Fri 9- something,  you run a few ads on CL or at your work and find 2-3 regulars going your way and work out a simple deal for 50 bucks a week per person which works out to 5 bucks each way, per trip. Such a deal.

If not, you can sign up for Lyft and Uber and take your chances each day and split your money. Lyft destination doesn’t work . If you wanna go south they will send you north. Uber is a little bit better . But if you want to do it, have in mind that you gonna need to leave way earlier then usual . Try checking out waze carpool! I started doing this last month, and I’ve liked it so far, but to be honest I’ve only taken the same passenger every day because we really get along. And it’s only on the ride home. 

The passenger told me that she paid around $4, but I actually got paid $7.40 because waze gives me some kind of “launch bonus” with the difference. I think it’s a promotion just to get more people to do it, so I’m assuming it won’t last forever. Dropping this person off adds about 7-9 minutes to my drive, so I feel that it is worth it. Youll be late every time."
question to drivers from a customer. do you prefer back seat or front seat?,150,83.27439690328582,Lyft,Sometimes I never know if I should sit in the back or in the front. What do you guys prefer?,"The back if you want a quiet ride or need your personal space, the front if you want to chat.

It’s so awkward when someone sits at the front and doesn’t say anything!!! I don’t care honestly. Only spot that makes me nervous is when they sit directly behind me and the opposite side is open. I don’t like being able to see them easily. Trunk imo Whatever you want. The whole car is going to the same place. The backseat is definitely for the pax. If they get in the front sometimes it’s awkward especially if they smell! Sit in the back. The back. Sit in the back please!  Especially if you aren’t going to talk. The only place I don't like is the seat directly behind me (if you're the only one riding). It's hot here, the air conditioner feels better in the front, so I feel more comfortable with my solo passengers in the front. If you sit in the back, I feel like I'm fretting over whether or not your getting enough air. I have it on full blast then I can't hear you when you're trying to chat which causes me to turn it down a notch.... Turns into a whole mothering complex cycle for me LOL if you're in the front I know you're comfortable and I don't have to worry about it.

That being said, drivers are divided on this topic so it's best to just quickly ask your driver, ""Front or back?"". Back seat passenger side, please and thank you! 

Reason: you're easily visible in the rear-view mirror, and an unruly passenger is least able to physically attack you without warning. The back. Someone sitting in the front when the back is available strikes me as odd and even a little uncomfortable to me. Back please. Front is weird. I am driving you around, im not your friend. Back seat. I always say back seat in a regular taxi. I never sit up front unless there's more people in the car with me. An Back seat only unless you get carsick. I dont want to be near your odor, your germs, your spray n' say style of speech spewing a fine mist of saliva all over my open beverages up front while I gently caress your forearm each time I reach for them in the dark. Plus there are enough vids of drivers getting sucker punched from the front that I just dont trust you, sorry. I’ll ask the driver “front or back?” If they don’t have a preference I’ll take the front for the legroom, especially if it’s a small car. I don’t care either way, but if you sit in the front seat at least be a little chatty.  Front seat silent people are a little scary. The back. Always the back Sit in the front if you like, its not a big deal but I do prefer them sitting in the back. I pick up a pac, same person on average of once a week. It's about a 15 minute ride. She sits in front seat which is ok with me. Problem is, she says nothing at all. When she gets out of the car I always tell her to have a great day. She shuts the door. Very awkward,  if you're going to sit 2 feet away from me in the front seat, at least say hi? If you’re not gonna wear a seatbelt hop in the back g I really don’t care. When pax ask me, I always tell them wherever they are most comfortable. One easy hint that you don’t want to chat is to be on your phone. My son is on the autism spectrum and uses Uber to get to work sometimes. He is super uncomfortable with small talk so I told him to just be in his phone and it works every time Older people almost always sit in the front. I like to have a normal conversation with people. I would rather not talk if people are with another person or if they have their earbuds in. A long ride is especially grueling and makes it difficult for a driver to stay awake. So please talk if you are going on a 30 minute or more ride. I once drove from San Pedro to Las Vegas with a passenger who either slept or talked on his phone the entire way and had almost nothing to say to me. I could barely stay awake! So please talk! Please tip us we are struggling financially and after expenses are making far less than minimum wages. You are expected to tip generously for the waitress that serves you, but your life is in the hands of the driver and you ignore him or her, why ? I blame Uber , they began as a low cost taxi alternative and tipping was not necessary they stated on their app. I like to be in the front when I'm driving. Unless there’s som specific reason for it, I prefer people sit in the back. I’ve read that some people prefer sitting in the front because they get car sick. One woman told me she sits in the front because that’s what someone advised her to do so someone couldn’t engage the child-safety locks. 

I really don’t mind where they choose to sit, but do feel like the back would be most comfortable for them. The answer to this question varies from driver to driver. I'd say, if you're being picked up in a safe place, take the 10 seconds to ask.

For me, and I'll add that I'm female, I feel most secure when I can keep an eye on my passenger. I'm also chatty with passengers who like to chat. So I prefer front seat followed by back passenger's side and please don't sit directly behind me. Seems you got mixed opinions here. You can always ask the driver if they care. As other posts said, it all goes to the same place so you might as well sit where you want. I prefer the front when I ride because it's easier to get in and out usually (long legs, not the most flexible person). Sit wherever you want, but if you sit up front and don't ask for music, I will assume you want to chat The front, please. This isn't a limo, and I'm a person! I've got over 3,000 rides, but I don't mind either way, talkers or not.

When I would get a passenger, I greet them, verify their name, destination, if they have a preferred route (if I'm unfamiliar with the area), and ask them how their day is going. If they continue the conversation from there, I'll continue to chat. If they don't say anything else, neither do I. I don't mind talking, I don't mind not talking. You're paying me for a service, I want you to be comfortable. Never take the front seat ! Never ! Depends- are you creepy? I do not care personally. I understand some pax, especially females riding alone, are a little leary about getting in the front seat with a driver especially a male one who is on the larger size (I'm about 6' 9"" and 280 lbs). Never offended if any pax chooses to sit in back. I have had some men and women hop in front with me without any apprehension and some who seem very standoffish but most just get in the back seemingly out of habit like they would a taxi since most taxis I have been in do not allow you to sit in front or only do if there is not enough room in the back. The back!  Stay out of my space if you can. honestly, MOST of you pax do not tip.

i have worked entire shifts where less than 10% of the pax tipped.  thats right, 90% tipped ZERO.

seriously, its almost insane.  If someone did that in a restaurant they would get told to never come back.  but with their uber/lyft drivers, people ""forget"" to tip all the time.

Just once i'd love to run into one of these non-tippers on my day off, just once.  But until that day comes, all i can do is tell the non-tippers to loosen the purse strings, stop being greedy, and tip your driver as you should do!

So, sit in the front, in the back, sit on the roof for all I care.  We could care less seat you sit in, but we do care about getting tipped.

so really... if you actually care about us drivers, the only thing you need to do is make sure you tip us.

 #tipyourdriver I'm sure the robot drivers won't care where passenger sits. As a rider I generally like the back seat and not have to buckle up as I would in the front. I have one driver I get somewhat regularly and I'll sit in front with him and talk, otherwise I prefer back seat. If the driver wants someone in the back push the front seat up and/or put some things on the front seat and pull up to the customer with the back door of the car even with the rider. Sit. In. The. Back.!!! I honestly don't care either way. I'm so used to passengers sitting in the front that whenever I'm hanging with friends and they sit in the front with me, I get kinda weirded out lol.

But as a driver, I don't care about where they sit; just whatever makes them feel comfortable. Sit up front and let’s dialogue l! Prefer front. Strongly prefer front.  

They can’t attack me or break anything without me seeing it.  

They can help point the way if going somewhere new to me, like their house.  


And once someone was running a red light. The pax was able to see it before I could due to angles.  I’ll never know for sure but it might of made the difference in not having an accident.

Bonus that they are less likely to be get car sick and have more room. If you're going to get chatty with me and you're alone, sit up front! Some people for me just climb into the front seat, and would refuse to sit anywhere else. Others, mainly younger people just sit in the back. If the customer isn’t sitting in my lap I don’t pull off"
Oops another one!,1,83.44693162551908,Lyft,Image,I hate these because Lyft will prioritize other drivers that don't have the bonus I once received one and had it for almost three and a half hours in one of the busiest markets in the US
Welcome to Los Angeles to all of you Lyft drivers in any other market making nothing while we rake it up 6 figures 2700 dollar sign up bonus and we still going ! LA till we die !,18,83.44800801440797,Lyft,Image,"Enjoying paying out the ass for everything meh I will pass.

Someone making 100k is still In poverty in la LA is a Third World city with First World prices. A decent studio is $1500/month. Gas is 50% higher than pretty much any other state. Homeless people run rampant crapping on sidewalks, cars, etc. Illegal aliens are everywhere. 50% of car accidents are hit and runs. And on and on. How much is your gas and rent? I rest my case. My best week in LA back when primetime was still around was about $1400 take home after expenses. Unless you are driving lux or xl 14 hrs in app a day I doubt six figures is possible. This has to be a joke, basically LA is one of the worst markets. You're delusional if you think you're killing it in LA getting a 4 dollar bonus to your 2.62 fare that took you 30 minutes to complete. Also, have fun here with the worst traffic. Also, ya go to Texas for good money, or Chicago. LA? You're sniffing glue, and it's not even good glue. Also please sign up using my links, I'm a multi level marketer more than a driver. BIOYA"
got dropped off but app shows my ride is still ongoing,4,83.62967468108843,Lyft,"Got dropped off an hour ago, but the app still shows I'm at my dropoff location and the driver hasn't moved from the dropoff spot.  They did drive off after I got dropped off, so something appears to be bugging out, but I can't call another one until this ends some how?","It sounds like a bug. On the driver side of things, I’ve dropped off a passenger and ended the trip then the app froze so I had to force quit and restart. I’m sure that must of left a trip or two in some software limbo for a pax. 

I would check on it later to see if it corrected itself and if you got charged extra time and not distance, then contact lyft. Either the driver forgot to drop you off or there’s a bug in the system I have had an issue a time or 2 where the app wouldn't let me drop off pax. Connectivity issue with phone service, same with picking people up. Dead zones suck"
"I am not the type to get mad... But i was just doing a streak from 3:45 till about an hour ago, The person I was going to be picking up was my last person for my streak bonus and I was on my way to them no traffic nothing perfectly fine. And they canceled on me.",7,83.74136449590326,Lyft,So I received the 5 dollar cancelation fee... Then I lose my streak bonus???!!! And to boot she re request me I was thinking maybe after the ride the streak may have glitched or something but it didn't. So I just waisted about 3 hours so 1 person can cancel on me that's so messed up.... Then I call Lyft get to the right person then she puts me on hold for 45 minutes just to hang up on me. I heard them come back to the phone and then just hung up on me. I'm totally not happy right now. In sorry I had to vent man... Thanks for listening lol.,"Streaks are for suckers.. they say drivers should only get paid for the work they do. They can bonus you the same way without forcing you to take rides you wouldn’t take otherwise. It's frustrating but you have a better leg to stand on once you complete another ride, then you can argue that the PAX cancelled - not you (assuming you didn't cancel the 2nd time they requested you) and since it was the 3rd ride (and not the 1st) it doesn't matter what time you completed the last one as long as you completed 3 in a row after the streak started. You expect to get a bonus for a streak of rides including a ride you didn’t even start?"
Pax Off the Grid drop,21,84.0028344033217,Lyft,"So I answer a ping directly OTW home from work. I pull up, confirm name,  address drop off, etc. All good.

I start the ride (strip center) and before I could even leave the parking lot, pax says if I could do extra stop, NOT along the route, he doesn’t know address. I repeat back what I heard and he confirms.  I advise no, in that case all I can do is proceed to drop off, I could make a stop along the route however.  

He then says to cancel and to let him exit.  No problem.  I complete the ride after having drove about 100 feet.  The app asks if I’m sure, I click yes and complete the ride.  A pop up appears and says network error. 

All that to say, I didn’t get paid anything.  Not even a cancel fee.

I texted support only to discover that they show me cancelling, not completing.  I also found out that it’s possible to legit cancel a ride after it’s starts, news to me.","I had a pax try to cancel mid ride thinking the app wouldn't alert me. Was trying to get a free ride. Instead he got dropped off in the middle of nowhere when he canceled and Lyft gave me a 20$ bonus credit for the guys bullshit Why didn't you have him add the stop in his app? I'd drive the guy wherever he wants since we get paid by distance and time... The app sucks and has been doing weird stuff like this to me lately too. Also the audacity of that pax, ugh! The problem guys is that I didn’t cancel squat.  I picked up, confirmed, and then started Ride. Before I left parking lot, he asked about adding a stop.  Claimed the old “ I don’t know how to add” thing.  No biggie, I’m native and know HTown very well.  He could not, would not provide the stop’s address, however.  I then told him I could only drop him at his noted destination.  He requested the cancel."
"""Rate Passenger"" option not showing on my app. Why?",5,84.00660755146984,Lyft,Image,"Did you scroll down, I just checked mine and you have to scroll down and you’ll see it. If not, I would clear it out of memory and restart it and make sure you have a good signal Are they getting a bad rating? :-P"
5 Min. Wait Time Started Too Early...,40,84.2457510699994,Lyft,"I had a very engaging and wonderful driver yesterday. The ride was great, but before the pickup, the 5 minute wait time started while the driver was several red lights away. It seemed excessively early to start the countdown*. By the time he got to my apartment, there was less than 2 minutes on the clock. I have screen shots. 

1.) When I brought it up, he said he had no idea about it, it was a glitch in the app, and I should report it. I think that’s b.s., but maybe I’m wrong about that? What do you think?

2.) What would happen if he got stuck behind a garbage truck, or some other delay, that would run the clock out entirely before he even got to my apartment? Would I be required to pay the “no-show” fee if he was the one to not show up in time?

*I’m always at the pin when I order the car, so the five minute wait time isn’t an issue for me. I just don’t like being scammed, and starting the clock early seems scammy to me. Unless it was a glitch in the app in which case, I’ll stop worrying about it.","You probably wouldn't have to pay the no-show because they didn't start the ride at your pick up spot. They don't allow cancel fees for tapping it early because they know some drivers have tried to game the system. Lyft is kinda stupid and doesn't always have the distance to pickup correct. I'm a driver, I've had countdowns start when I'm far away, or when I've already been at the pick up destination for several minutes. It doesn't seem to have any consistency and does what it wants, and is one of the few reasons why I prefer driving for uber. The clock used to start when the driver is nearby but after people game the system it only starts when the driver manually clicks arrive. Like everyone else here have said the driver probably just wanted to know where you were going to see if it was worth it or not. I'm sure drivers don't do this a lot probably if it's their last ride or a ride from an area they aren't familiar with. Especially since destination filters cannot be placed during trip requests or in between trips.

Edit: -can +cannot Nah no glitch that I’m aware of unless they accidentally tapped the arrived button. I’m aware that some markets have the slide to arrive option as well. Not in my market yet though (Phoenix, AZ) 

Otherwise they straight up lied 🤥 In my market I literally get 0.10 cents a minute extra for that shit.  I don’t know how much extra it is on your side. So no we aren’t trying to rip you off.   We’re also incentivized to complete the trip quickly so we can start another one and keep our profit per hour higher, so keep that in mind.   We also don’t wanna be stuck over there in that traffic lol.  The cancel fee occurs only I think if they cancel and were also completely arrived at your pin in the GPS.  I will cancel sometimes though if I can’t make it to the pin or get into your complex (happens more often than you’d think)

Edit:  also, if you don’t know, the clock for Uber starts automatically as it’s GPS based.  So if your house is right by the rode and they need to drive right past it in order to turn in to the neighborhood, if it’s close enough it will start.  But don’t worry, if your at the pin, they will come there as long as you’re not in the middle of a Forrest or on a mountain or some other crazy stuff I’ve seen Rest assured that the driver had no control over the timer. It is within Lyft's app, as we approach our pickup point, the app sends out a notification to the pax and also starts the clock on our end. All on Lyft, none on your driver. Did it effect ur ride in anyway? no right so stop whining like really come on ain't nobody got time to be waiting for ur ass for 5 min this way u get the alert early and u get ur ass down by the time we get there simple as that dont have a titi attack The app will instruct the driver to ""drive closer to pick up"" if the ride is attempted to early start by the driver, and the clock will not activate. Manual. If a driver doesnt have a 90% ar then we cant see the trip until we click that button.

My guess is that he clicked it to see where you were going so he could determine if the ride was worth it. 

The funny thing is, he wouldnt get the fee because he started early and wasn't at the destination. Although he could see where you were going he wouldn't of been able to get the fee if the clock ran out

I feel drivers try to take advantage of this. Parking around the corner to start the ride and see if the ride's worth it. If its right down the road, the fee is worth more than the ride because we only get 3 dollars for short rides when a no show is 5. 

People like this is what makes lyft look bad Drivers do this to me *Every* time. I guess they want to screen my location first. I put in exact businesses and they still start the timer two-three blocks away. It's so annoying because I'm not sure if they're trying to scam me out of a cancel fee Sounds fair. Get your ass outside! [deleted]"
"As drivers, what air refresheners/scents do y’all like to use?",14,84.60775338481422,Lyft,"I’ve been buying the new car scent pine trees to hang from the mirror because I think they smell great and are relatively cheap, but they only last at most 2 days (probably by design). What do y’all use that you find works for you?","NONE. I don't know one rider that enjoys the toxic, chemical smell of those cheap air fresheners. They just give everyone a headache and just breathing the air in makes me want to vomit. Sometimes I get the Frebreeze air freshener that you clip on the air vent. I'm sure it's not that much more healthy but it doesn't have a horrible chemical smell and it's not overwhelming. I use California Car Scents. The odor eliminator not the air freshener. Coronado Berry. Find it at Wal-Mart. Most people like it. Out of 1700 rides I've only had 2 complain because of allergies. I use one of those big black binder clips to attach fabric softener sheets to the air vents under the seats. I also keep a spray bottle of fabreeze in the trunk. New car gel things that fit in the door cup holder out of sight and a light disinfectant spray for cars at end of day. 
Avoid Nozium though; stuff is awful and smells like ass. Sex wax pina colada air fresheners. Buy them at the local surf shop. Lavender is usually a mellow, easy scent that most people find inoffensive. Anything woodsy usually works too. I just fart a lot, best scent and it's free. I mean minus the money it cost to eat all the taco bell I can get my hands on. 😁 I hate fake scents. I have a charcoal thing that absorbs strange orders. I have a organic lavender cleaner I use in the dash. Which makes it smell nice without being offensive. I vape various desert flavors, so my car smells like fresh baked pie or pancakes. You are welcome None, I use axe dark temptation body spray on myself and gay men tell me the car smells nice. I use peach Ozium."
Has anyone actually succeeded in disputing a damage fee you 100% know you didn't do?,13,84.70384134777719,Lyft,"A driver picked up my family of 5 from the Fort Lauderdale airport. We paid extra for a vehicle large enough for all of us. He shows up in such a vehicle but had his entire third row collapsed. We asked multiple times to lift just one side for us and he refused. It was late (1 AM) and we were exhausted and said whatever and just accepted the ride anyway. We didn't leave a tip for the fact that he accepted a ride for 5 but only had 4 seats available and refused to let us use the back row.

He later submitted a picture of spilled baby formula powder in his back floorboard, charged us a $100 damage fee, we refuted it through Lyft's email chain, and they still rejected our statement and agreed to charge us the fee anyway.

Our twins are 6 and our other child is 13, way beyond the age of baby formula. Not only that, but with 4 people crammed into his back seat, there would be footprints of formula all over the floorboard. The picture showed none. It was a fresh spill.

Two simple bits of common sense would tell you that this was not us. I'm not sure if he was retaliating against us for not tipping or if another ride did it and he mistakenly thought it was us.  Either way, they sided with him.

Even if it were us, $100 to clean up baby formula from rubber floor mats is excessive. The only thing close to food in our possession was chewing gum in my pocket in the front seat. The only thing drink related was my daughter's stainless steel water bottle, which was empty, in her volleyball bag in the cargo area.

The only thing in the floorboard besides the feet of 4 illegally-sitting passengers was my wife's purse, which has nothing on it like you would think it should after sitting in baby formula for 15 minutes.

We're going to speak with our credit union tomorrow morning to dispute the charge, but since Lyft made an official decision in the driver's favor it doesn't sound like we'll have much luck.

Any other course of action here?","This is why when you get a ride you always use a credit card that way if there is a fraud you can initiate a fraud request with your credit card and get your money back How are they charging 100$ for some powder?

How was everyone safely secured if there weren't enough seats? You paid for XL and got screwed.

You'll have a long drawn out fight getting them to rescind the fee. Ha. This guy gets $100 for some powder while other drivers with actual damage get a ""we're sorry."" Terrible. It sounds to me like the either the driver or Lyft support mistakenly put the damage claim ticket on the wrong ride. 
I’d explain to Lyft that you have no babies or baby formula and raise the possibility of ^^. Give them a chance to make it right before you charge it back on your CC. You need to contact Lyft Safety Team.  Not providing enough seatbelts is illegal.  Driver was excepting XL rides and you were not provided the service even you requested.  The driver put you and your family into dangerous situation.   I drive Premium XL and I would never allow more than 6 riders nor would I ever deny a customer the usage of third row seats under any circumstances.  It’s just not safe.  Call Lyft Safety team. You will get action.   It’s definitely a huge liability for Lyft.  And for the idiot driver he is liable if he was pulled over by police or in an accident.  Report to Uber the broken seatbelts. So many good drivers and hate these idiots who give us all a bad name.  I’m retired and I enjoy doing this but I’ve seen drivers jam 9 passengers into 5 seat small suv.  They stuff passengers in very back.  Dumb stuff. Good luck"

"Two years ago, John Zimmer lied to the public and said the majority of its rides would be self-driving electric cars by 2021 to virtue signal to save the earth and get investor money.

There is not one autonomous car even available.  The cars now simply use a radar cruise control so they dont hit anything and then cameras to watch lane markers to maintain a lane.  Not one can actually make turns and drive around a residential neighborhood.  Sure it can make the occasional lane change, but that's on a highway.  These current systems require constant human intervention.  Companies are scared to death to push the envelope past this because the liability of the absolute certainty of accidents. Also note: 

1) Chevy no longer makes the Bolt 

2) GM has no active partnership with Lyft anymore. 


Lyft has no friends left except what’s in the gas tank of PR that they can buy by throwing tax write offs at idiotic causes instead of drivers. This is just a typical investor scam. Everyone involved knows the game. Like uber's silly 3D renderings of flying cars. Do you realize the certification and testing process the FAA requires just to bring a new plane to market? We're talking any ole airplane based upon proven technology for the last 80 years. And yet Uber is suddenly going to design quad copters capable of ferrying humans and have it all set and ready to go in the next 3 years from start to finish. 

A sucker and his money are soon parted."

I'll be in the middle of a ride and Lyft will AUTOMATICALLY give me another ride without telling me it's over 45 mins. It's so annoying, I don't understand it. This last time it happend, was during rush hour. If I had known it was over 45 mins I would not have accepted it. Because it was rush hour, I know that I would just be sitting in traffic and not going anywhere. Lyft will tell you if the ride is over 45 mins if your not in the middle of a ride, but won't say anything if your doing a ride. Makes so sense. Just another reason why Lyft sucks. Anyone else have this problem?","I also wish they would tell you the passengers rating when this happens. It is lame.

I asked her to cancel in the app but she said that the app told her to call the driver. Then she hung up. I was forced to cancel on my side and my acceptance rate suffered. 

How could I handle this better in the future?","Understand that pax will lie to you to get out of paying the cancel fee.  Next time either call them on their bs, or say ok and continue to wait out the 5 minutes, call them letting it ring once, hang up, and get your $5 fee. Never cancel a ride until the 5 minutes are up. You showed up. You wait 5 to collect 5. After timer clocks down you will receive the option to cancel with "" pax did not show"". You weren't forced to cancel you opted to cancel and let pax off the hook. Wait out the 5 minutes bruh, wtf are you doing?"
Lyft Drivers who panhandle their passengers?,66,85.47894551449076,Lyft,"Just experienced weird lyft ride today.  Had a lyft driver who asked for a small donation in lyft tip for his child who is very sick. He says he is expected to pass away soon and wants to use the extra money to give him a final good life experience.

He handed me a very worn cardboard/crayon note  explaining his situation in detail 1 min before my arrival to my destination. (Disguised as a kid wrote it)

He also had a nice photo of his kid on the note and apparently his kid had hodegkins lymphoma disease. (Spelt correctly in kid format...)

It was also weird that he started the lyft ride asking if we minded he play music. I didn't mind but I did notice it was all Christian station music the entire time.  

He had a nice car was very newish looking. 

Has anyone else encountered something like this?","Newish cars dont mean they belong to them, lol. At least he didn’t try to sell you drugs. wouldn't have to panhandle if lyft paid more than half of minimum wage to it's drivers. His car was probably a rental which means he’s stuck in the rental program and making less than minimum wage. This is going to be the new normal with lyft cutting rates and drivers getting trapped. 1 star his ass, enough 1 stars and he'll get fired. That's not ok even if it is true. Different scenario. I had a driver about 3 years ago ask me for $10 in cash to grab some lunch (I don't think instant pay was a thing at the time).   


He offered to reimburse me through the app by cancelling the ride.  I gave him the $6 I had in my pocket, but I was still charged for the ride. Man, any time I get a driver playing christian music i blast something obnoxious on my phone.  It's so fucking offensive to passengers to play that kind of stuff, so yeah, considering all that, he was def trying to scam you.    


I once had a crazy christian driver who wouldn't let me out of the car until i took his prayer card and kept saying ""look at me, jesus is coming, the end is coming, look at me"" fucking freak man Had a guy tell me a sob story about his wife being at the hospital with cancer. I tipped him $5.I always tip anyways so there's that If our cars aren't newish looking, the company denies us our ""privilege"" to drive for them. I don't play music except at very low, barely recognizable volume, so no one can hear what they're singing. That does sound kind of preachy. I wouldn't assume he was lying, but it's possible he's lying. No, I've never been rolled by a Lyft driver. I believe this becoming the trendy thing to do now.

With sites like Go-Fund-Me and the like becoming more mainstreamed into society others are looking to take advantage of the model (captive panhandling) as it never occurred to them in the past. Over here on Uber they are approaching drivers with these CARGO boxes full of snacks to sell and samples to give away. 90% don't want to hear it so I just let it sit there for the occasional pax who asks about it. I buy good cocaine off most my rides. did it work? did you tip him?

asking for a friend."
Cancelled pick up,13,85.96159597746752,Lyft,"Yes it happens to us all the time. I just had a scheduled pick up cancel as I was heading towards the pick up destination.  Well I excepted the trip about an hour and 20 minutes before the pick up time so I more otlr less went off line until I heading towards the PaX. Once I hit the hwy I got a text that said

Something went wrong and the scheduled pickup for 2:00 PM has been cancelled - sorry about that.

WTF!!??  I think there should be a cancellation fee for this. Especially a scheduled pick up that cancels. My rant is over..","Pick up time was 2pm, they canceled about 1:45 Totally ridiculous, there absolutely should be a fee it’s no different. I’m planning my work schedule around you so I should get paid when you cancel last minute. Just like if you schedule a flight and you cancel it last minute you have to pay a fee. I had a scheduled pick up and the guy never showed or answer my calls. I waited a additional 10 minutes and had to cancel the ride myself.

I submitted a report to Lyft and they reimbursed me 10$ for my troubles.

Complain to Lyft. Explain everything you just said here. They may reimburse you something for your troubles. It should be something like a cancelation fee if you cancel within 2 hours of the pick up time something like that You rubes sound so entitled and its hilarious.

Just because your en route, doesnt mean you should get one. Policies state that you have to be at the pickup location waiting to be qualified for a cancellation fee and even then you have a ten minute window to even get there. 

Say the pick up is at 5pm, you'd have till 5:09 to get there and start the clock in order to be qualified. 

You aren't actually doing work till you get to the pickup. These extra fees are whats making the company look bad. Stop making lyft look bad by trying to cry about easy money."
Can anyone explain to me why the Lyft platform fee is so high?,9,86.18561218117122,Lyft,Image,"Because they're losing money and siphoning more and more from the driver. Cause robot cars cost a lot of money to produce ""Average Lyft fee last 100 rides""??

Granted, I have less than 400 rides total, but I've never seen this. Is it market dependent? They pay you your per mile rate and charge the customer as much as the market will bear. They pay taxes & fees then whatever is left over is this ""platform fee"".

Machine learning determines prices, it's not set by some primetime multiple anymore. That's what came from first, upfront pricing, second, personal power zones. They were never for *your* benefit. Lyft’s attempt at profitability They use a sliding scale...your yakr will vary anywhere from as low as 50 percent to 70 percent. It really depends on hows much revenue they need for that month and they know you can't and won't do shit. The shorter the ride is...the higher and closer to the 50 percent take they get. Don't believe me? Check all yourindividual earnings and their percentages esp those shorter trips that are 10 to 15 bucks.  Why? 
Because you agreed to drive people around in exchange for peanuts, and they have decided to charge people reasonable fees for the labor and service you provide them and pocket the difference. Welcome to fake ‘woke’ capitalism."
I can see where my lost phone is and it’s in the driver’s car,6,86.18786912562395,Lyft,My husband left his phone in our Lyft on Sunday night. All day yesterday I could see his phone using “find my location” and it was definitely in the driver’s car traveling around. He contacted Lyft yesterday morning and they still say they haven’t heard back from the driver. We will keep trying today but I’m not sure what to do in this situation. Obviously the driver has a life and might have other jobs but it would be nice to at least know we can get it back eventually?,"He is some basic advice. Keep your phone ringer on loud. If you forget it somewhere call it right away, talk to the person that picks up. Arrange to meet to pick up the phone and compensate that person for their effort. Otherwise, just forget about the phone. You will not get it back. Hopefully his next passanger didn't find the phone in the back seat and pocket it for himself. If you don't get an answer from the driver and the cell still has battery power and can be tracked you can visit that address and retrieve the phone. In this case you may want to contact your local police department for safety when retrieving the phone."
I don’t think Cameron is gonna make it,19,86.52524181080913,Lyft,Image,"Total earning for this trip $7.86 I’ve calculated using google earth that Cameron is approximately 4,950 miles away from you. Lyft is telling you he will be there in 310 hours. This means they are expecting him to be travelling at 15mph. A Dodge Dart can travel substantially faster than that. This leads me to believe that not only is Cameron on an Oil Tanker (which travel 15mph), but that Lyft KNOWS he is on a tanker and is still conning you into believing he’s in a Dodge Dart. WHY? What is Lyft hiding?? Why don’t they want you to know he’ll be picking you up in an oil tanker?? Probably went to go chase after a PPZ bonus of $2.80 guaranteed on the next ride. I had a guy who set his destination as Lima, Peru.  I was like “honey, you got that much money because have family in Chiclayo and want to visit them.” SWIM, Cameron...swim! Oh no Jared !! This can't be real lol A three hours tour... He’s got it chill out dudes a pro. Standard ride i find in my queue after completing a ride He's got a 4.9..he will not risk a low rating.

Lyft driver almost took me out in the bike lane on Sunday,46,86.67209366267201,Lyft,"I've looked high and low and I can't find anywhere to report this.  Unless you are a passenger Lyft doesn't seem to want to know.

Anyone have any knowledge of how I can report this driver?  I have a picture of him in the bike lane dropping off his passengers.","Did you blow past a stop sign or a light were you driving the wrong way on the road.

 There is a lot of almost and maybes in life. none of them are worthy of you getting fired. I bet you've almost done something that could have gotten you fired from a job. Just being honest but nothing will become of this. You have a picture of a lyft car, your story, and no damages. Lyft is a booking company that capitalizes on maximum drivers on the road. So unless you have video of someone insanely illegal they dont give a fuck. 

Keep in mind they used to pay our tickets when we broke the law, especially for illegally parking so good luck. Call the cops if you're that upset about it. Lyft isn't going to do anything at all. They don't give a fuck about you unless you're a paying customer or a plaintiff in a lawsuit... I can save you some time though, the cops aren't going to do shit either. This sub isn’t going to be a good place to get sympathy or anything. Lyft is impossible to deal with for anything and everything except when you need to pay them. Good luck! There's a Help option in the app and on their website. Although you were likely at fault.....you most certainly can make a “Community Member” complaint.......start on Twitter. I don’t know how to help you with contacting Lyft, but I did want to say a couple things as a cyclist, and as a Lyft driver.

Drivers often stop where the passenger has requested, and he may not have noticed the bike lane. I highly doubt this driver intentionally cut you off, as causing you to slam into his car would likely cause damage and prevent him from moving on to accept the next ride request. He needs to do this as quickly as possible because he is paid poorly for his time. Perhaps he noticed the bike lane but did not see you were approaching? In an effort to drop passengers off in a safe area (and not in the middle of traffic) I have blocked the bike lane before, knowing my time there would be exceedingly brief.  As a cyclist, I also know we are very protective of our bike lane as we are traveling essentially unprotected amidst hundreds of moving metal boxes, BUT...  if you were traveling at a safe rate of speed for the area (and it sounds like you were because you were able to stop before making contact) you’ve got to be prepared for cars or pedestrians occasionally interrupting your smooth travel.

The planet is overpopulated, cities are poorly planned, & we are surrounded by idiots, just be thankful you were uninjured and let go of the negativity. 
The guy sounded like an asshole, don’t stoop to his level, let karma do the rest. They won't even try to identify the driver unless you rode with him and can reference your ride to them.

You'll be better off filing a police report against the individual, but that's probably not going to do anything. Listen, Lyft has a safety team.  You can contact the safety team. Please know you will be putting g driver through hell when he is emailed the complaint.  There’s ton of bad drivers and I do not know who Driver is, but know this for sure.  He could be deactivated.  At least the driver pulled over and did not block the street so traffic could continue.  I see idiot drivers park in the middle of a one way street to let passengers ur if vehicle.  It sucks when this happens.  I’m not sure about drivers passengers and their intentions.  Are there posted signs that state no stopping or standing?"
Trying to travel the country while drivinf for lyft,43,86.9050450515747,Lyft,"So I actually posted about this about a month ago and the basic answer I got was that I would have to keep changing my “driver area” each time I went to a new city and that it would likely be a hassle as each state has different requirements but recently I just went on vacation to NYC and lyft let me turn on the app without any issues. I’ve heard New York is the hardest one to get into and I turned on the app with no problem. I would really like to travel the country while doing lyft to support my travels, has anyone done this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","Might have been a glitch.

 If a law enforcement see you doing this in nyc since your not registered with the city agencies you will get a gnarly ticket Lyft will let you operate just about anywhere. Their official stance is you can’t, but in reality, you can. There’s been plenty of driver who have driven cross country for vacation and have picked up fares in various areas. It works in *MOST* areas. There are a few areas where Lyft won’t let you go online, but there’s more that you can than you can’t. I literally just posted about this earlier today!

I was picked up over the weekend by this guy with Connecticut plates. Just like you said, I thought you couldn't do that, except for random middle of nowhere places. I talked to him at length about it and he says he comes over twice a year and does the drive. I am actually inclined to believe him. 

&#x200B;

So can it be done? I have seen it first hand Different by the state, I believe you need a Lyft inspection in each state, an address in that state and car registration for that state. Did you get ride requests in New York? I've only heard of ride requests on the boarders of your registered state. I’m in Colorado but a few weeks ago I was in Dallas and was able to do a few rides. Wasn't someone doing this a while ago? HMMM, that is interesting. I know NYC now requires ride share drivers to get a TLC permit. You have to get an upgraded license, drug test, take a couple of classes. Its a bit of a process and there is a good long wait list from what I understand. That is if you are in the 5 boroughs. Outside of the 5 boroughs I think it is still pretty much unregulated.

&#x200B;

But hey if they let you go online in Manhattan or Brooklyn and take trips that is on them not you. You didn't know any better. [Try this instead, Waze Carpool](https://www.waze.com/carpool). Wasn't someone doing this a while ago? Wasn't someone doing this a while ago? Technically you have to be licenced and insured for each state you drive in regardless of if you are just traveling through. I asked the same thing about going from Seattle to LA and Lyft said if I turn on my app and do accept a few rides along the way I would most likely be deactivated as a driver due to ""insurance issues."" This was about 4 months ago so I'm not sure if the policy is still the same or not, I'd try reaching out to the impossible to reach customer support and ask them directly. You can drive anywhere outside your state for up to two weeks.
You could even give one ride back in your home state then go back out for another 2 weeks. I drove a guy who worked for Lyft and he told me. I just went to another state for awhile and it was fine...def feel like I should have been busier so I wondered if since I was out of state I got less rides...not sure. I didn't try to drive over 2 weeks.

Sidebar: Uber you have to get approved to drive in the city about 7-14 days ahead of time. But wonder if that means your good for awhile? I can tell you that you can drive in South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and SW Minnesota. I can also tell you that you can't drive in Minneapolis."
What to wear? And is there any surprises that I should be aware of?,14,87.1692464404636,Lyft,So I'm going to start driving next week through Lyft rental car next Friday. I'm currently only driving to get transportation to go to college. I was wondering what I should wear? Also I already set aside 120for gas for the first week .,"I didn’t know Lyft had a drinking program You have to wear a tuxedo. It’s the rules Where whatever you're comfortable in.  Obviously you don't want to smell bad, so take a shower.  :P

Also, hope you won't be drinking while doing Lyft.  :)

Be careful of the whole rental program, hopefully some others will be around to give you input on that.  I have my own car that's paid for, so for me it makes sense. I usually just drive in the nude. You’re way overpaying for whatever vehicle they gave you, guaranteed. 

The 20 ride minimum (to keep the vehicle) will not pay for the car - probably around half. So unless you have time for around 40 rides a week, plan on paying out of pocket for your rental. 

Depending on your area, the roads may be saturated with rideshare drivers. I’m in Las Vegas and they are everywhere. I wait around for rides quite a bit except for Friday and Saturday nights.  20 rides might not sound like a lot, but it’s a lot of time in your car if you’re only getting 1 ride an hour. 

Also, Lyft pays significantly less per mile (39 cents) when you rent a car from them as opposed to using your own vehicle (60 cents). Ass chaps because you're about to get screwed. My husband has found that he does better in tips if he is wearing a golf shirt or button up. Clown mask and loincloth"

You'll know soon enough... I come across any of these cars and I already have my mind made up I'm not tipping.  Keep it simple, I don't want a bunch of crap all over the car i'm riding in. Cutesy crap doesn't help with tips or rating (not that rating really matters). Commuters don't care and drunks will mess anything up. You will find soon enough that the pay won't justify spending any money on your car that isn't tires, brakes, or surprise costs. I put my spartan tab up. It’s a great conversation starter. I also play hella good music 🎶 So after every race they give you a finisher medal. Then if you wanted you can opt for a spartan tab that will have your name, time, and a choice of words you want to put on. I find that 80% of passengers either want to do a race or have done one before and just want to talk about it. Also I normally play upbeat African music, people seem to like it a lot. Also play old Sokol hip hop, and new Ol Skoo music lol I’ve started using Velcro to attach doctor who figures to my dash. I also have a little blue car that’s bigger on the inside and passengers can be my companions. Give passengers other topics to discuss to keep it new and not so repetitive.

If you can't find in the app, Google it.

It is impossible for a driver to confuse a pickup/drop off point because you don't get that until you arrive. The driver can't cancel  ride.  His app stopped working after he drove out of  California heading East.  Last update had him in Utah Yes it was a joke.  Obviously, the driver must be fairly new and has not masteted the art of ride share driving for Lyft and Uber.   If your making yourself available to provide driver services and you accept ride, than that means being available for any ride regardless of distance or location. Never start a ride before pickup for many reasons.  You may not want Rider and once you  start ride, you than become subject to a poor rating should you cancel the drivebfor any reason."

ANOTHER fraudulent damage claim!,24,87.88826264420041,Lyft,"A friend and I opted against driving in an (impending) tropical storm, and chose to use Lyft instead. Big mistake.

I woke up this morning to two pictures of a wet seat and a damage fee. The driver's claim? Wait for it... wait for it... I *urinated* on the seat. Yes, folks, the driver claims I pissed on her seat but, despite this, still had the good graces to drive me home for her fraction of my $15 fare. When I disputed this, the Lyft team told me, I kid you not, ""Accidents happen"" and that her pictures in a well-lit area are sufficient evidence to support her claim.

Now, I grant that accidents happen. But, riddle me this, Lyft:

- Why would pissing on yourself stain a seat? I was wearing sturdy Levi's, and I imagine the piss would go down my pant leg. No?
- I live on a country road that is not lit, let alone well-lit. Her ""well-lit picture"" is further evidence of this complete scam.

Raising these two issues in an appeal went absolutely nowhere. Lyft is complicit in a scam and I won't be. Uber and taxis, from here on out.","The same thing would happen to you in a Uber. It's the same cars and drivers 90% of the time and Uber's policies are even more lax than Lyft's.

I suggest you take a quick (and I mean quick) pic of your seating area with your phone when exiting your ride share. Have your phone ready to take the pic as you exit.

Just as experienced drivers keep a dash cam recording of rides pax should keep a record of their seating area upon exit. It makes sense that it would puddle in the seat.  Most are angled backwards from the jump, but even if it isn't your weight would form a depression in the cushion.  This kept the urine in the seat of your pants.  Unfortunately for the driver, even ""sturdy Levi's"" cant stop the deluge when an adult urinates on themselves.  I think you should just quietly take this L instead of parading it all over Reddit.  

&#x200B;

I drove Uber and Lyft for a while, and we understand that accidents happen.  I want you to know that your driver was not trying to embarrass you by reaching out to lyft.  They were more than happy to make sure you got home safe, despite the fact that you had defaced their vehicle.  Urine causes many problems for fabrics and surfaces beyond odor, and it takes money to clean and make that right.  This is the only reason they did that, and I'm sorry you feel betrayed and choose to lash out.  One day soon you will be posting about how you reached out to the driver and bought them a new car because you felt such remorse for your behavior :) We'll all have a big laugh ;) Ugh. That just sucks and is not OK. Total bullshit. IDK who in their right mind would pee on a seat!?!? I mean I guess if you were plastered but even then..........

Lyft has started adding a (timed) button before confirming your ride asking if you'd like to upgrade to Luxe. Trying to trick you into spending more.,13,88.4927302368068,Lyft,"This is predatory and terrible. 

So, the userface allows you to go through the usual steps of calling a ride but the button which usually read something along the lines of ""confirm"" or ""pick up"" has changed to ""upgrade"". This tricks users into upgrading their ride to a more expensive one. 

This is terrible because anyone who has used the app would follow the usual steps to calling a ride but accidentally end up spending twice the amount of money. 

Even worse, Lyft knows that a huge portion of it's clientele are people going home late after a night of  drinking, which are people who won't catch this. 

Even sober I've almost fallen for it multiple times. 

This is manipulative and shitty and I have yet another reason to hate this company.","This is going to be blamed on the driver, over and over again, I guarantee it. I use Uber also and recently when I used it instead of the default being at Uberx , which I always use when doing Uber, it was at something called Comfort which is higher price and I had to manually click back to Uberx or I would have got Comfort (whatever that is) As a LUX driver that never gives LUX rides, I approve! Lol They’re screwing passengers now too?? Dang. I stopped driving for them since their IPO cuz they have literally done a complete 180 and gone to shit for drivers - charge passengers the big surges, and don’t pay drivers anything but the measly $0.56 a mile on those surge ides, often leaving us drivers with only 30% of the fare.

Lyft is smart tho. They only want their indentured servants (underpriveleged immigrants usually) who were conned into paying $400-500 a week for a car rental thru Lyft’s Express Drive program to get rides as THEY are the ones forced to stay in the app for shit rates.

Oh well now the riders are feeling Lyft’s fuckery. 

Looks like that “Golden Fistbump” has turned into the “Golden Fisting.” But the button that upgrades you says ""Upgrade"" right?   That's not really tricking people.

Passenger pickup PSA,1,88.49857514421421,Lyft,"     Be mindful of your pickup location. Choose a stop sign or a parking lot if there is one nearby, your driver doesn't want to be the ass hat that stops 15+ cars of traffic downtown to pick you up.

     THIS ONE IS FOR THE DRIVERS ALSO: try not to let a bad day ruin the pax/drivers ride/rating. We are all trying to accomplish the same goal here. I think the best we can do is try to make it as smooth as possible.

Has adding in perks for your riders shown increase of tippers?,5,88.69835523682887,Lyft,"I was wondering if there is any actual proof that adding in perks for your riders helps you get tipping. I'm thinking about adding in wifi hotspot, water bottles, snacks, condoms, over the counter drugs like ibuprofen or tylenol, an aux cord for music and maybe some other things. Thing is I want to make sure it would be even worth it to stock up on these things first. I had someone tip me once because they had a runny nose and I just so happened to have some napkins from a restaurant up in the front they could use to blow their nose out.","I have tried hard candy, chocolate, and small bottles of water. Most people declined and could care less. Does. Not. Increase. Tips. 

You know what does? Being a salesman. A smooth talker / operator. 

Wanna make more in tips? Watch a few seminars on selling and sales. 

Seriously tho. I just found out a friend of mine has been killing it on Uber the entire time I was barely making what he was for twice the time on the app. Same rating.. same amount of rides.. difference is? He accepts all rides no matter what.. has a history as a sales rep, and has driven cab on and off for 10 years..

He only drives after work (5-8,9,10pm at the latest) and sometimes in the morning for food money before work. 

For some reason Uber plugs him in the Algorithm and he says he constantly gets pings always busy.

His tips were twice mine consistently, and I made above average compared to other drivers I've talked with..

He's a veteran in the trade tho, and knows how to talk to people, could sell a ketchup popsicle to a woman in a white dress.. 😂 

Also fuck Uber. I have a small bag with waters and and charger and candy that sits on the back of my seat. Only younger kids tend to tip better because they tend to take something. Otherwise anyone over 25 could give a rats ass what I got back there. On occasion I give out shots of fire ball. I ID everyone. But I usually double what I paid in tips. I have added mints, starbursts, tissues and some sample sized lotions I had laying around the house (I’m in the desert Southwest). My tips seem to have been more consistent since. I recently added cards with my Freebird referral code. Hoping to see some $ from those."

Has anyone needed gross income for the current year (in the past)? The driver dashboard only provides net income, and the gross income only shows on the 2018 or prior year's entire tax summary which is only given in January of the upcoming year. Can Lyft help me here in any way ? They keep referring me to the dashboard or simply are telling me that they do not provide current gross income.  Can't they help me for a legal matter? It cannot be this difficult, can it?

&#x200B;

The only option I see so far is to manually calculate every single ride through the dashboard and add numbers by weekly total and then monthly. I need everything from 2019 so can you imagine how long that would take!? I am in desperation as some of you may know, bankruptcy is time-sensitive.  Someone please help =(","Cant you just add up all the bank deposits for the year? Gross income for the self employed is a gray area. There is no hard she fast as to what it is. I'm guessing the lawyer is asking for the number that will be reported on your 1099 form? It's all a guesstimate this early in the year, so use last year's number to guesstimate what percent of Lyft takes. All I did was print each week, from a computer using Lyft dashboard, dating back how many months the lawyer is requesting.  I needed it for the same purpose. Uber is way easier, and uses less paper!

Newest way lyft steals from drivers,9,89.17046171833519,Lyft,Ever notice when you arrive at a pickup it has the estimated route be a nice long route but then as soon as you pick up the customer they change it to a shorter route that takes one to two minutes extra but up to 5 miles less so you would get half the price but they still charge the customer for the full-length route. Meaning they pocket more money and we pocket less.,"Lyft will always send you on shortest route (miles) and they prob charge passenger based on the longest (miles) reasonable route. It’s our job to be aware and maximize our miles without pissing off the passenger.  When i can add an extra few miles I will tell the passenger they are doing construction, there’s an accident, etc... be creative and take the longer route.  Also, ask passenger if you can go a certain route.  They seem to be very receptive most times. What's preventing you from taking the route you want? As long as it's reasonable and makes sense, the passenger won't complain, since they're getting charged a flat fee. The routes are Google maps routes, calculated once when the passenger books and then again when you pick up, I'm not doubting that Lyft pockets any extra efficiency profits on the recalc but I doubt they are directly manipulating the route length other than leaving traffic out of the initial calc."

Interesting/awkward GoGoGrandma pickup today...,2,89.41990616278792,Lyft,"So I got off of my day job a little early today and fired up the app, instantly got an XL + long ride request from Hemet (Inland Empire suburbs, low-income area), about 20 minutes away from me in Menifee...being in SoCal, long rides usually lead to busy areas, so I take it and drive out. GGG texts me that I'm picking up 4 people + luggage...no big deal. Get to the pickup, find out that it's 5 people and luggage, and my Tiguan seats a tight 7...luggage barely fits with the back row down. Pax promises $20 cash tip if I take this over-capacity, no-seatbelt group on their 50-mile drive to the Greyhound station...I took a chance and ran with it. 

After getting underway, they told me they had requested the ride a full three hours before I received the ping! I got there around 3:30pm, they had requested at 1pm...they were in a suburban area, but a relatively remote one, and I know very few XL drivers waste their time with it as it is a good 30-45 minutes from any destinations worthwhile. I honestly felt bad for them for waiting for so long, I can only imagine how frustrating that was (and it showed in their initial interactions with me, they were quite hostile)...I know XL can be hard to get in some areas, but that is by far the longest any passenger of mine in two years has waited to get a ride.  

The group was actually pretty friendly after that very awkward start, the ringleader barking orders to fit people in the car was actually very personable...and she personally handed me my $20 as I unloaded their luggage at the station. 

Probably wasn't the wisest decision I've made as a driver (especially after being followed by highway patrol for half of the ride), but I'm thankful it worked out. $90 for an hour of work. After having a similar group stiff me on the 4th of July, it was nice to win one for once. It was even nicer to be back on my couch with a whiskey at 7pm after making my net for the day.

Drive on Friday they said. It will be worth it they said.,38,89.46880662575087,Lyft,Image,"Ouch, better hit up those personal power zones, bro...


Just kidding. It doesn't exist. I tried going out last night. One 7 minute ride got me deactivated. It was only worth $3.08. 

The guy left something in car and then called me to ask if i would bring it back. I was doing a food delivery so i told him I'd drop it off after that. I then go through the proper lyft channels so they know. He texts me saying that lyft is trying to charge 15 dollars for the returning of the item and asks if i would bring the item back and he will throw more of a tip.

I told him he didn't even tip in the first place but id bring back the item, also thanks for the bonus. He got the item and i got deactivated because some asshole didnt wanna pay out extra. Still waiting on that finders fee lyft.

What do i even do now?! Lyft wont respond and the app is waiting for a background check to occur. I dont ""have permission"" to ride share anymore. i was out in Los Angeles tonight and made a good $100 at least after gas.... it only took 15 hours to do, but hey, it's more money than when I began the day. Just drove 9 hours and made $200 

San Diego is a good market. 

I also recommend doing uber too and leaving both on while waiting. 

Also, if a pax takes you to a rural area far from bars or city centers, it helps to drive back to those areas. Whenever I end up in east county (rural) if I wait around there its very slow, drive back to the city or coast and its pings all around. Where are you though? Like Nebraska? This is how my Friday yesterday went.  Was super excited that my second (And last) ride of the day was Lyft XL, until I got there and it was a family of 12, which my vehicle obviously could not handle properly.  Hey at least I made 3 bucks earlier! Damn i only made 12 last night smh I’m in West Palm beach fl. The best I can average 10$ a hour. And that a good day. I’m in Seattle and made like 200 dollars in 6 hours, do uber and lyft! sometimes lyft dies on me and I get uber rides none stop and sometimes the opposite. weekend nights stick with places full of bars don’t just wait in the house or a dead area, because uber and lyft always prefer the closer drivers to people, and you know there’s tons of drivers during the weekend, so it is really competitive. Honestly it depends where you are. I live 40 miles from LA and if I try and do a Friday night out here nothing but when I go to LA and stay near Hollywood then I make a good 100. Go to Albany Corvallis you will do better Holy crap. What area do you live in?

I drove 7 hours on Friday and made $127 , which is $18.14 an hour. if you notice bigger Lyft take out, simply turn off the app. that's the time when IPO nagging Lyft. do your thing to upgrade yourself and try next week. Unless you love it and born to Lyfting.

Lyft playing with 45+ notifications?,6,89.49438532946563,Lyft,"  
I don't take 45+ rides after 3:00 pm because it is evident I will end up in a rush hour traffic hell hole (Los Angeles). But twice this week I ignored two 45+ rides -- then got a long ride that came in without the 45+ notification. One was 55 minutes, the one today nearly 90 minutes.   


Perhaps it was a coincidence both times, but I'm inclined to think that if we ignore a couple of 45+ rides, Lyft will still slip one through in disguise. WTF. That's dirty.","The traffic data is at least a couple hours old.  So those rides may have ended up being longer than they thought.  Also 40 minute rides can quickly turn into much longer rides in LA if traffic takes a turn.

I often get fake 45+ rides that are actually short rides.  It’s crappy all around. Sometimes I fee like Lyft’s algorithms are like that passive aggressive sibling. “He won’t take this shared ride?! Give him ALL THE SHARED RIDES!!!!! Forever.” My last 45+ ping was actually a 3.5 hours ride ... I had to cancel on them. I've had the exact opposite. Trips that are easily 90 miles that had no warning whatsoever."
Lyft rental car,12,89.80300801465081,Lyft,Hi I'm 25 and was planning on renting a car for a week and it costs $250 after taxes and I'm located in Sacramento. I was planning on driving from 3 or 4 days.  I'm looking to make maybe 250-300 per week. How many hours should I have to drive. I mainly want a car to help me commute to school.,"You’re going to want to budget 35-40 hours for that kinda profit. When I was with Lyft Express Drive in L.A. it took me two full days to cover the rental. If I got lucky, a day and a half. Then I had to start working on the $150 gas budget. So basically I was working 3 days for rental and gas, and 3 days for profit (taking one day off). 

That's not the worst thing in the world, but you really have to work hard, and if you have a bad week, your budget goes to shit.

On top of the expenses, if you get a crappy car from Hertz you will be even more miserable.

Sounds in Android Lyft App (NOT DRIVER APP!),1,89.91005662577571,Lyft,"I am trying to disable that sound that my app makes and replace it with something else. I have a paid app (Tasker) that does replace these notification sounds. But I cannot get the Lyft App to stop with it's regular sound on the initial use of the app. This causes the app to give me both sounds at once, a cacophony of noise!

Does anyone know which ""stream"" the Android Lyft app for passengers uses for its sounds? This will help me customize a Tasker script to disable the default Lyft sound on its stream by lowering the volume briefly on its stream and and replacing with my own on a different stream. Choices are:

* Alarm
* Notification
* Ringer
* System
* Media

I find tons of information about the driver app. I read somewhere the driver app uses the ""Alarm"" stream by default because mostly it is always on on many phones. But I can find nothing to support this on the passenger app.

Question about Lyft policy in CA,36,89.95193162578676,Lyft,"Hi guys,

My uncle works for Lyft. He got robbed last night by a rider. He was able to set a police report and call Lyft about the incident. Since it happen last night, lyft hasn't gotten back to him yet.

My question is, do you know if Lyft covers your personal belonging if they get stolen by passengers. 
The riders took his wallet, glasses, chargers cord, and a gold chain (so far he remembered).
thankfully they didnt take his phone.

I appreciate any word on this.

best.

Edit: thank you guys for your responses.","Nope. Got robbed myself yesterday. Los Angeleez. Two girls, one stun gun. Got my phone, dash cam(!), backpack with tablet, eyeglasses, keys, etc. First violence in 16K rides.

Waiting to hear from Lyft re: insurance coverage for loss. I expect my homeowner's coverage may apply. I felt sad to hear about that, tell him I send positive energy. 

 If you think it's appropriate if he decides to do Lyft after this terrible experience,  tell him don't wear any rings, any gold chains, don't take his wallet, I don't even keep a debit card in the car or on me.  He can put his debit card on his phone and pay through Samsung pay, Google pay, Android pay, iPhone pay, some banks even have a wallet to tap and pay with the phone. Tell him it is very dangerous.

 There's no way to dodge something like that, all of us drivers are susceptible to being robbed or murdered or in a accident. it's very dangerous job to do even before Uber and Lyft the taxi cabs used to have to be on constant look out.

 Whenever I'm doing a session I try to be aware. If Lyft's insurance covers this, he's going to be subject to a $2500 deductible, which effectively makes Lyft's insurance useless. Pretend Lyft doesn't have insurance.

He should go through his own rideshare insurance.

If he doesn't have his own rideshare insurance, he should be glad it was simple theft, and not extreme property damage. I was robbed by a rider once. I contacted Lyft about it and they in turn contacted the rider. Rider said I was driving under the influence so I was suspended. Once i was reinstated nothing happened. They are probably still riding with Lyft to this day. Lyft is useless they wont cover anything that is not attached to your car and even then you have to show receipt best thing to do is get lawyer and sue lyft to get the riders info  and go from there police and lawyers are your only option don’t waste your time with lyft driver support. Independent contractor driver is on his own. No retard is going to use their own account to rob a driver... Why would Lyft cover anything? Your Uncle should have had the common sense to not bring something like a gold chain with him while out driving for ridesharing. I don't care what anyone says, I don't even bring my wallet. I just bring my Costco credit card (Bay Area driver ftw), maybe a personal credit card and my drivers license. That's it. Definitely no jewelry, no Apple watches, nothing. Nothing has happened to me in 850+ rides all around the Bay Area.

Edit: Maybe renter's insurance could cover those items, (even then, doubtful) but other than that, no Lyft will not pay up for scenario's like this as I as a driver have seen nothing to this effect in the 2 years I have driven for them. A benefit like that would be pretty widely advertised and often abused.

Also your Uncle should be thanking his lucky stars his car didn't get stolen dude"

Chicago Insurance,7,90.07613301468668,Lyft,"Hello Fellow Lyfters! 

&#x200B;

I've recently been approved to begin my ride sharing career here in the Windy City, and I am admittedly quite eager to get started hunting for a little supplementary income. That said, I do not like to jump into any new enterprise without throwing a good bit of research behind the decision. I've been reading through this sub to circumvent the common obstacles and nuisances. A recurring theme that I'm noticing as of late is the subject of insurance. Before I get on the road, I wanted to check with the more experienced among you to make sure that I have sufficient coverage to avoid any financial hardship. 

Are you guys insured as commercial drivers, or do you rely on a combination of your personal insurance and the coverage that comes with Lyft automatically?

My current plan, I've been able to confirm, does not cater to the ride sharing industry at all. Adding commercial coverage would be an extra $50.00/month (which is not unmanageable), but is it necessary? If I have an accident while operating as a Lyft driver, I know that my insurance won't cover it; but I should be under Lyft's umbrella unless I miss my guess?

If I should have an accident while outside of my operation as a lyft driver, my personal plan should kick in shouldn't it?

&#x200B;

Thank you for any insight that you can provide.","One thing you NEED to do. If you’re not gonna swap to commercial. Add a rideshare endorsement. It will protect you and your insurance may go up a few bucks. But your insurance won’t drop you after a rideshare related accident. You arent getting full commercial livery insurance for $50 more than normal insurance. Full commercial livery is $400-550/mo. Just know the difference. What you are buying is some type of hybrid policy. Lyfts deductible is also $2,500 btw. If you have the option of carrying commercial for only that much more ? DO IT. you’ll never have to worry about insurance again. It may differ depending on the state (I'm in California), but I have a rideshare endorsement on my regular Allstate policy that only costs a few bucks more per month. In addition, this coverage acts as primary so I don't have to pay Lyft's ridiculous deductible in case of a collision."
Was wondering if I could ask Pax for tips? ...or will I get deactivated for it,19,90.4527765332052,Lyft,"Like if they say thank you for the ride, I could say. “The best way to show appreciation is with a tip, a little goes a long way.” 
Is it against the TOS to ask for tips.  I put so much into my car to help these pax and they can’t tip.
I’m really tired of being complimented and getting stiffed...","Sure you can ask but it's tacky as hell and I dont think anyone would ever tip if you asked them to like this. Best solution is to just stop wasting money giving pax the red carpet treatment or whatever it is you are ""putting into"" it. Just keep the car relatively clean and drive. No drinks, no candy, no video games, no wifi, no bullshit. Don’t ask directly. 

You can point out how much of what the pax pays Lyft you get. But you have to do it with some tact. 

I like when a pax asks how much I make. I can walk them through “about half the amount you pay comes to me, the other half goes to Lyft, and my half had to buy this car, pay for insurance, pay for gas, and so on. So this ride cost you what... $10? (They usually agree) so I get around $5 and after expenses I’ll keep $4 and I can do usually 2 an hour, so it really depends on how well you get tipped.) 

That line has been very profitable. 

If they are non talkers, just hope they tip and expect them not to. I'm afraid the bigger problem lies in this thread. You are making a thread asking if if it's ok to ask for tips. If you dont know the answer to this question without a thread asking lyft reddit, I'd consider a new line of work. They’ll just say, don’t worry I’ll tip you in the app and have no worries about not doing it because they’ll most likely never see you again. There's one guy I've gotten a ride with a few times and he has a professional looking sign on the back of the passenger front seat with something about tipping would be appreciated but not necessary or something like that, just enough to make you fell a little guilty if you didn't tip but not like you better tip.  If a guy actually talked about it out loud I'd stiff him. The only times I don't tip is if the driver is smoking or playing loud music or is a bad driver, otherwise they get a tip."

In Twin Cities, I rarely get a rider.  I forgot it was on once and over an hour later it chimed in while I was driving for Uber. Last night i was out for 2 hours, 58 mins and made 12.73 dollars.

The market is oversaturated. Too many drivers = no surges. Base fare is not worth driving in. Wow, Lyft pays so less. I am certain that Uber pays way more in most of the cities. Lyft is a joke. It's not normal where I live. 7 rides for me is easily over $100. It’s the Summertime normal, you’ll have to take what you can get till school/college starts back up fully. It doesn’t help much either that a shit ton of minimum fares are being replaced by scooters, but then that may not be a bad thing. Turn on all your foodie apps that’s where everyone’s at for the next few months. Sometimes you get what you give - and if you're only doing an hour or so a day, you're only going to get an hour or so in payoff - This is only part of the story - Does not have acceptance rating, does not have driver rating, and does not have data regarding the number of drivers on the road and number of normal rider requests. As well as times and places driven. For example the the City of Hemet and San Jacinto CA have drivers from other cities working the rider crops. At one point I am sure there were more riders then drivers, now, there are more drivers than riders. The crops are too thin and those who do get the riders are those who have higher ratings and higher reviews. But for the most part, in an over saturated market like Hemet and San Jacinto it all comes down to lady luck.  If you score a rider, go buy a lotto ticket, because it's your lucky day..  

Don't let it get you down - Keep on Keeping On - You will prevail\~!!! Sadly yes. It’s been a game of decreasing earnings since mid june, getting gradually worse. Making me frustrated and I am surely not alone. In LA the roads are flooded with lyft drivers day and night. Events suck, airport traffic is the worst, fuck ppzs, lowest earnings yet this week. Im going to be spending the spare time figuring a way to get into a good job that actually pays.

Good luck! Thanks for the feedback. Basically, I should expect $1 an hour until the fall unless I drive the graveyard shift. I got approved for Uber this morning so hopefully that will help. It's the new normal! I've completed 10 rides the past couple of days all 3 to 4 dollars. On the 10th i was deactivated.

For some reason pax thing we are unemployed schmucks looking for a quick buck. I was deactivated because someone left something in my car and didn't wanna pay the 15 dollar finders fee. They got the item back, i got deactivated. I am a new driver in the Fort Lauderdale/ Miami area. I have tried driving in busy spots, suburbs at night, near hotels and every other place I saw recommended online. The line to pick up at the airport is often over 200 people and I tried waiting for an hour with still over 100 people in front of me. Is this normal? Will it be better on the weekend? Is there something I can do better? At this rate I have actually lost money. Too many drivers, not enough passengers.

Beginning of month means broke people not spending money after paying bills and any part timers hitting the road to help pay those same bills.  

Add in spending on 4th of July weekend activities and that makes this week even worse, I predict a very slow weekend following this slow week too.  Next week will be better as paychecks roll in.

Schools are also out so less student commutes and more students doing part time driving.   Focus on tourism related locations and look up medium and big events to pick up at.  Medium is better (I.e. smaller concerts) because traffic won’t be gridlocked but demand will still be high and you may be able to get 2-3 people going home early before the event ends.

This is why they should close new signups and let supply of drivers quitting correct the oversaturation in markets like this.

Use my code and sign up for Uber if you haven’t.  Two apps on at the same time = better chance to get rides quickly.  Could really use the referral bonus as I’m broke AF right now.

https://partners.uber.com/i/gfe5r7vpx What exactly are you asking? Not many rides? not much money per ride? No tips? The app looks funny? Not the “dude I drive someone else to work on my commute and make millions on two rides” your friend promised?

It’s summer and the market is saturated. Teachers, college students, and retirees who drive for shits and giggles love summers. 

If you want to make money, you now have to get away from the pack. Look at ultra late nights 12am-10am when usually middle age married female school teachers and bad eyesight retirees don’t want to work. 

I was out in the sticks yesterday and I checked the passenger app, they had 8 drivers within .5 miles from me. All obviously chilling at the house with the app running. Those areas are where pings go to die. 

If things feel slow, check the pax app and your network, it’s probably one of those two things killing you."

Curious about other female drivers,16,91.54513764436322,Lyft,I’m looking to start driving occasionally for extra money and wondering what female drivers do with their purses or wallets while they are driving.  I don’t have an actual trunk or a locking glove compartment in my car.,"I'm glad you asked this question, I'm a female driver and been on the road about 4 weeks. I haven't once been afraid and probably am not as cautious as I should be. Been taking my regular purse and just putting it on the passenger seat, moving it before front seat passengers get in. Clearly, I didn't think that through! Thanks for the question and advice all! I use a small cosmetic pouch to hold a small card holder and anything else I need. It can fit in my console and I carry it like a clutch if I go anywhere I carry a small canvas crossbody, enough for my wallet, Kindle (barely), and a granola bar. Strap goes on the seat and around the seat buckle so that the bag is hanging to barely rest on the floor, I sit on the strap so it's double secured. It's behind my right leg so I honestly don't notice it.

I should note, even at full extension, when attached to the seat buckle my bag cannot reach the pedals. Occasionally after an emergency stop (LA traffic, I do my best but can't stop the way other people drive) I'll feel it brush against my leg. The bag zips shut and then has a flap. Shit ain't going nowhere. If you decide to drive, share your location with family member or close friend.  Best of luck if you decide to drive. https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1655/0665/products/TB29QPMgTcCL1FjSZFPXXXZgpXa__2891274079_2048x.jpg?v=1523075885 I keep my wallet with my important stuff (License, debit card, etc) in my pocket. I have a second larger wallet for everything else in my purse, but I don't bring my purse when I drive. I keep a small bag with my that has my wallet and chapstick and such in it. I keep it on the passenger seat to try and deter male passengers from sitting up there. Like, if they a creep, I want them in the back. If they seem decent or the car is full, I just take the bag and tuck it under my seat. Hey! A female driver here!! I put all my stuff in my door side. Sometimes I put everything in a backpack on the back of my car. Men have been doing just fine without purses. Do whatever they’re doing."
California Drivers: Looks like we're becoming employees.,113,91.55939690362247,Lyft,Image,"The only thing we’re becoming is jobless lol. Now they will fire you for the slightest thing We can sit here as drivers and speculate about what kinds of changes being an employee will bring, but it would be nice to hear from either of the two companies what types of measures they will take if the bill does pass. Great job Cali drivers, you've played yourselves. Love it!! Excited to see some profits go back into the economy finally!!

More than Likely they will change things so they wont have to classify you as employees. Scheduled times and being fired for no reason is nothing more than scare tactics that rideshare shills want all the drivers to think about. California law wants rideshare companies to either make drivers true IC's or employees not this half assed you are IC when they feel like it. Now these TNC rapists will get the fines/back pay and benny liabilities to every member of the horde here that they fully deserve.  #winning by gettin more free checks from them.  This is a 💩 gig that will eventually be eliminated by the Johnny fleet.  Get paid now because ur gettin replaced by a Johnny later. Does that mean all 3.2 million drivers will be eligible to claim unemployment if Uber & Lyft decide to fire them all?  I don't see this going over well for them, the drivers or the tax payers.  Good luck fellow drivers!  I'd suggest ramping up your plan B. (The following is just me whining.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, in my area, I'm part of the Express Drive stuff (I know, mock me for being dumb)

right now I'm averaging about 740 a week. take away the car cost, that'll be 500 a week, which, IS about 12.5 an hour over a 40 hour week. Not a bunch, I'm sure ya'll do better, but it works for my situation.

BEST case scenario, I'm gonna be put in shitty scheduled blocks where I'll get 12 an hour for 30 hour blocks. 

So I'll lose freedom of schedule, only make 360 a week, so after car payment that'll be....120 take home a week. About 380 dollars a week lost. Plus STILL no healthcare.

This is best case scenario for me in my area, and that's assuming I'm not one of the multitude of drivers that will get laid off after this, assuming that Lyft doesn't just lay off EVERYONE and bail on the state all together.

&#x200B;

So, I'm curious as to how I could possibly benefit off of California's decision to babysit me and hold my hand and say ""No, you don't get to make your own decisions now, WE will tell you what's good for you.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also as I understand it, this bill effects ALL independent contractors in the entire state. You could potentially see a lot of businesses either go under entirely or bail on the state. Do you all know how employee leasing works?   A third party company employs you and leases you back to original company.  It’s a work around and would not surprise me if Lyft and Uber attempted to try this.  

I truly think if law is adopted that drivers can force a job action or inaction against both companies forcing them to negotiate with drivers or face potential unionization. 13/hr + .58/mile + tips. That is the legal MINIMUM they will have to pay in CA. There are quite a few uber/Lyft employees in this thread spreading mis information. Why would this be a bad thing Business models that are built on the backs of ""independent employees"" who supply everything should be illegal. The drivers carry most of the risk  with little to no reward. Should be interesting to see how this plays out. They'll have to create a new model that ensures drivers make minimum wage. I would assume they can enforce the acceptance rate now and fire you if you drop too low. Or else what would stop someone from sitting at home and just doing nothing for min wage. They'll have to choose drivers based on earnings over distance to pickup. So they'll choose Johnny 10 minutes away who's only averaging $6/hr over Diana who's 2 minutes away already making above minimum. If you just had a $25 ride to the airport, you'll be set for the next few hours and will be put on the back burner. They'll probably be more picky about what kind of car you drive. No way they'll let drivers go above 40 hours a week. Any other guesses? The only positives I see are tip encouragement for pax. Am I missing something? Yea fuck uber if it ever becomes employer in my town  they can kiss my ass and I will call in sick everyday lmao I still cannot figure out why many drivers advocated for this.  We will all be screwed in the end. Passengers tried to Rob me but i fought back and beat the shit out of one of them and got the whole thing on dash cam and my driver account still got suspended for few days cause the robber was butt hurt and didn’t know I has dash cam it was built into my mirror I ended up pressing charges at the police station for attempted robbery and it went no where cause everyone is useless in this world F*cking ridiculous. These dumbass politically correct politicians in office and oblivious dumbasses protesting not realizing they’re just digging a grave for all of us."
New driver need advice,2,91.58422329252517,Lyft,"I signed up for lyft using one of those guaranteed earnings bonus codes and it prompted me to either input my vehicle info or rent one.

It was within the month so I verified I was still qualified for the bonus and the on-boarding people said yes the timer starts once the car is rented.  A week in i receive mail saying something like good job x amount of rides left for your guaranteed earnings.  The following week I complete the required rides but no bonus is paid to me.

I tell her I was told I did qualify I have the email telling me good job and lyfts own site says rental drivers are eligible.  She says as a rental driver I’m not eligible for the bonus.  I ask if there’s anyone else I can speak with because she’s not really understanding and she said I can contact support by mail.  I did that and explained everything and haven’t heard anything in 4 days.  I tried calling in phone support and she stone walled me too with rental car drivers aren’t eligible  and she went on to say that rental car drivers get rental rewards instead, but that replaces the weekly rewards not a sign on bonus.

Need Help: Connectivity,6,91.72950107031122,Lyft,"This morning I started driving at 6am. Got 3 rides no problem.

7am I start heading down into the city where it is usually quite busy. Dead.

By 9am I'm over by the airport - wait through the whole damn queue - still nothing. First in queue for like 30 minutes.

This crap happened to me about a month ago and it (also) took me 2 hours to realize I just wasn't connecting to Lyft. I shut all apps down. Shut down WiFi. Restarted phone. That fixed it - a month ago. Today it's still nothing.

Correction, after the restart I started getting spammed with Poor Network Connection messages which are promptly followed by Good Network Connection! messages off and on every 15 seconds.

* Close unnecessary apps
* Toggle airplane mode on for 10 seconds (try an entire 10 minutes!)

* Restart your device (at least 5x now)
* Delete & Re-Download Lyft Driver App
* Turn off Wi-Fi
* Set background app refresh to Wi-Fi only

Only while using Lyft, and only after they sent out the mass email about connectivity solutions.  I believe this is being done on purpose. I was having this problem for more than 24 hours. Finally contacted lift (text message) and it cleared up before they contacted me back. Coincidence?? I don't know. But they are apparently looking into it."
Bogus ride requests,14,91.87572792216308,Lyft,"I'm a driver and I normally operate out of the airport and for a few weeks, I've been getting bogus requests to arrive at the terminal and it's pissing me off, is anyone else getting this?","It’s supposedly a new feature by Lyft that tries to auto-request drivers into terminals before actually matching them to passengers. They do this to try and save time for passengers that are in a hurry. In these cases I heard you can ignore the notifications for them and still stay in the airport queue. What do you mean bogus? I get that but it's usually an automated que to be in position fo a potential ride request. I did it a few times but now I just ignore until I have a confirmed pickup Yes. I know what you mean. I got burned on this earlier today and once or twice a week.

It just has you drive over to the airport for no reason, wait around like an idiot, possibly get yelled at by airport staff who don't want your car there even though it's probably not in anyone's way they just like to assert whatever authority they think they have. Then after 3 minutes tell you to march your happy ass back to the queue lot or risk losing your spot. 

&#x200B;

It's pretty awesome when it works, but I think it's a load of horseshit when it doesn't work. 

Especially because all the time I'm ordered to ""Return to Queue or lose your spot"" I can see other drivers picking people up. That really chaps my ass. It basically sucks up 10 minutes of my time NOT giving me a ride. 

&#x200B;

The airport in my area is kind of a big gamble in general, but this one makes it more so. 

Passengers love it when it works, though. The times it does work (I do take them if the airport is super busy, but I'm learning my lesson about passing if it's already a quiet time of day) I'm always trumpeted with ""OMG You got here so fast!"" and ""I didn't wait at all! That was amazing!"" and I'm just like ""Yeah, this time..."" in my head. It's just lyft wasting drivers time & money so their precious passengers dont have to wait more than 30 seconds upon exiting the terminal. Ignore the pings until you get a real one. Next time it happens to me I'm recording the screen and sending it to airport management so they know lyft is clogging up the waiting area."

I wouldn't rely on Lyft/Uber for full time income either.  Both companies will continue to cut drivers pay as they try and become profitable If your child is a service animal then maybe? The quick and most realistic answer is no. HOWEVER, and you can see posts here of passengers bringing it up. I have seen drivers with another passenger in the front seat. 

  
From a practical stand point, if she ends up having to pick up a group of 4 she can just cancel the ride. Thats the easy part. The real hard part is that some passengers wont feel comfortable with a second passenger let alone one with special needs. Someone sooner rather than later will report her and have her account deactivated. 

&#x200B;

Can she squeak by a few rides? probably. No. The driver's Terms of Service prohibit non-paying passengers. That's a negatory No in case you have to pick up a group of 4 people Only person allowed in the car minus any paying passengers is going to be your Mom."
Amp bar no longer in stock. Is this typical?

Need to pick up a few boxes (2-3) and 3 big bags from my storage unit?,28,92.2011908851619,Lyft,"Has anyone ever used Lyft to go to a public storage facility?

I just moved out of the area where my old storage unit is located. I did some research and saw that my Lyft ride from my storage unit to my home is going to roughly be $50. I also have cash on me for a tip. 

&#x200B;

Should I call or text the driver in advance? Should I request a certain size? Any ideas are helpful. I don't want to get denied or worst lose out on paying for my fare and get denied when they show up later on.","Yes you should request an XL, and tell the driver ahead of time. Even then your chances are slim. Go through the sub and look through all the posts of drivers complaining about passengers that get a ride to a store and are ""gonna be quick I just need a few things"". Lyft compensates poorly for sitting idle and waiting drivers don't like that at all. I will do that. 

When I get off of work I’ll be commuting via bus to the storage unit and already have stuff so no waiting necessary. I like being considerate Are the boxes heavy, big? How long would it take to get them in the car? If its light boxes/bags regardless of size or they are easy to get in the car it shouldn't be that big of a deal for a driver. You might be paying 50$ but they'll get paid less. So it's good that you have a tip. You can't request any specific-size vehicle. You can request XL, which could be a Suburban or could be a Mitsubishi Outlander with a tiny third-row. Depending on how much stuff you have, offhand I'd say you have about 50/50 odds of the driver rejecting your ride. We're not U-Hauls, we get paid to drive people.

Alternately: depending on your area, there ARE ride-share-like services but are meant for moving stuff. Just Google for moving services in your area. I would never go to some else’s storage unit and get their things for them. Too much risk. Request a ride to pick *you* up, add a stop at the storage unit. You get out and get your own stuff and I’ll help you load it. Final destination is wherever you want to move your crap. Are you trying to get drivers arrested for suspicion of stealing out of peoples storage units? Just go rent a truck from home depot for $20/day and don't bother gig drivers with your bullshit GFY. Lyft is not a moving company or a medical transport company. Find a friend with a pickup truck or rent one yourself.

"*RANT* Don't care that your animal is a service animal, it's not getting in my car",15,92.81171171853111,Lyft,I love that lyft assumes my car is actually their car and reminds me I violated the ToS by politely denying passengers a ride due to having a dog.,"In this case, you are doing some business. And you think you are the independent contractor. Unfortunately, anybody who does business with customers has to obey the law. This is not about Lyft. What can they do? They can't just remind you to obey the law and do nothing. it will be bad PR. And if Lyft thinks they can do nothing, somebody can report you directly to those who enforce the law or sue you. There was a lawsuit against Rideshare companies for this exact thing and they lost that's why they enforce it because they don't want to be sued and you're just a number on a spreadsheet they will terminate you in a heartbeat. 

That being said you should understand the law and know that even if it is a service animal they have sole responsibility for damages caused to establishment and property. 

A really good way to deal with this is before they get into the car get out and take a bunch of pictures of your vehicle and when they ask what you're doing explain to them that by law I have to take you in my vehicle but by law I can also sue you for damages and lost wages while my vehicle is being fixed, which I will. 

I would say 99% of the time people will cancel. 

One more note, real service animals are very well trained and won't cause you issues. It is annoying how many people take advantage of this.  But there are a lot of people who are veterans struggling with PTSD.  I think it’s worth asking.  Not trying to change your mind. As a vehicle-for-hire, you have to adhere to ADA laws. Even if you started your own limo service, you would still have to adhere to ADA laws or risk getting fined or sued or both. If you don't want to risk taking service animals, stop driving for Lyft. It should be a choice, not compulsory."

Please don’t leave crumbs and stains on your seats, and no seat covers won’t help.... I’m currently in a Lyft that is dirty all over. I’ve had this driver before and her car is always dirty. If y’all can’t take care of your vehicle for the customer, or at Least for your own self, don’t even bother driving us around. No one, and I mean Literally no one likes sitting in a dirty vehicle, mostly if it stinks. Just stop it already. >_<","Hey do u tip? EVER??? I used to take pride in having a clean car but the drivers here telling you.. you pay what you get for is an understatement... you might still be paying the same maybe even more but you are still paying way way less than you would from a regular taxi.

 As for drivers we have been getting paid less and less. I don't always drive I also use the platform whenever I dont want to move my car from a perfect parking spot from my home. And I tip the drivers cash whenever I do see a clean car and if there car is dirty or smells funky I politely and respectfully let them know... half the time they dont look back because of just constantly hitting accept to the next ride after someone gets out their car.

There has been so many times a pax leaves the car and they leave an empty can or gum wrapper in the car when my car is spotless and then when I hit the brakes to pick up another client I hear the noise of the can rattling around sometimes they leave a little and spills over... if I had music playing which I do most of the time I wouldn't even notice until a pax lets me know. 

In conclusion.... if you dont like getting a dirty car start emailing or writing letters to Lyft and or uber or any ridesharing app company and let them know you want their drivers to get paid more and that you'll look for an alternative until things get better... I doubt this will do much but if everyone did this we might see a change but highly doubt it since these companies have created entitled riders(like yourself) that want a better ride than any taxi could EVER give for a whole lot less payment and the one that gets screwed is the driver. As pointed out by some others......Lyft is a scumbag company, and has forced most all the drivers who actually cared, out.

The ones who are left are the ones who are/almost/would be homeless without Lyft/Uber. They are the modern day equivalent of day laborers. You got what you paid for.

Remember a few years ago when the price was double?  The cars were cleaner, the drivers bathed and offered free water bottles?  Yeah, drivers pay has gone down 50% since then and passengers stopped tipping when I offered free stuff.  

Your driver’s car was a mess because Uber/Lyft kept slashing fares and drivers had to work double to make the same money.  But passengers just kept hitting that button and never thinking about what was happening.  You just loved getting a screamingly cheap ride.

You got what you paid for. :( This makes me sad. Thank you for the detailed explanation. I’ll try contacting them, and hopefully they’ll hear me, and many others out. I hope it works and that you are all paid more. Yes all Lyft drivers are dirty.  /s


Maybe most of the good drivers fled the platform due to Lyft’s greediness, Did you ever think of that? When Lyft is taking up to 66% of the fare you pay, highly rated drivers are gonna jump ship. 

I had a 4.97 rating on Lyft, cleaned my car everyday and met many great people, but the introduction on Personal Power Zones was nothing but a money grab to steal from their “contractors”. Now my highly rated ass and my clean car are providing great services to Uber passengers, so in conclusion screw Lyft, screw their entitled passengers and screw personal power zones! Yesterday I got a ping almost 5mi away. It took me 10min to reach it, and a guy was going for 1.1mi. I earned decent $3.03 (Uber and Lyft both pay very good in my area, you know) for only 15minutes of easypeasy work.

Then I deducted 6miles\*$0.58 and found that I only lost $0.45 on this route. Not too bad, with my current savings I can continue to provide rideshare service to all those honorable people for at least two more months, until I'm out of money.

Unfortunately, my calculations clearly stated that I'd definitely need $2 tip to buy two tokens and vacuum my car at a car wash. Without that all those crumbs will stay in place. Wash my car at least once a week. Pax are dirty. If I do 160 rides then I have had maybe 300 people in my car or more. It’s hard to always keep clean inside but I do what my budget and time allows for. 


If paid more then I would be cleaning more for sure! These drivers that are saying they clean less because they get paid less are lazy assholes. Report them. Get them deactivated for all I care. Get them out of my market. I need more business. 

I vacuum with a handheld vacuum I keep in the trunk if I have time between rides. If I’m getting back to back rides, I’m not pulling over on the way to pick you up to clean my car. Need a pristine car? Go steal one for all I care. Stop using lyft. There will be less passengers, and more time for me to clean. You don't have to like it, you just have to pay.

Seriously though, driver here, passengers need to become okay with seat covers because it is the only way to protect the car. Someone spills coffee like every week in the car so seat covers are the only practical option. I might as well stick to lyft then. If they’re paying you guys better, and the vehicle is clean, then I’m happier. How about you PAX treat the car like it belongs to someone else?! Lol

Yet another Lyft scammer.,15,93.82235986671515,Lyft,"Lyft Scam. Driver accepted ride but he did not pick me up. He drove back and forth i95 for an hour going in one exit and out the other making a circle. He then marked me as dropped off and picked up. Apparently it shows I went from Deerfield to West Palm in 38 seconds and he traveled 16 miles! Inconceiveable!

Lyft really needs a way to cancel unpicked rides in the app. It took forever to get them on the phone to tell them to cancel my ride out so I could get another ride. By the time I got someone on the line He marks me as picked up and dropped off. The rain didn't help matters either. Brandon was super helpful in getting it refunded though. That's the good thing about Lyft is that theyre easy to work with when it comes to issues, once you get them on the line of course..

 https://imgur.com/gallery/01dn0SI","Well, driver was an idiot. 1 star him, and escalate safety issue. To whit, driver is a fucking thief. Lyft WILL take action once an actual person looks at it. Shared doesn't pay any extra if there's one person in the car or 3 people, that was pure Lyft profit. Your in my hood! Maybe I’ll pick ya up sometime. If it was a shared ride he might have had other passengers in the car and was dropping them off first, maybe he did it by accident or maybe he passed the exit and he didn't want to bother getting off and backtracking to pick up another passenger he won't get paid any extra for taking. None of this is your fault and you definitely shouldn't be charged for a trip you never took but shared rides have a multitude of variables that you might not realize from your end. He might have missed the notification about another rider being added and once he saw it, he just picked you up and dropped you off to get rid of you in the queue. Some drivers think (and it has happened) that if you cancel one of the shared rides, it cancels the entire route and you won't get paid for any of it. Did you happen to notice if there were other passengers in the car ahead of you? ?

The app shows when you’ve been picked up. I’m not sure I understand the 38 second comment, but this should be a no brainer. Get your money back and report this driver. all part of the shared ride BS. Don't be cheap"
Drivers: Are long rides bad?,14,93.86827421857804,Lyft,"Saturday night, I missed a train and took a Lyft from the literal center of downtown to a venue in the suburbs, twenty miles north. 

After the concert, I took a Lyft home. That driver needed fifteen minutes to finish a prior drive and pick us up, and the drive was maybe 30 miles and 45 minutes, taking the driver from the northern suburbs, through the center of the city, and out to the western suburbs. I tipped 25% in-app for each ride, and each driver was actually super awesome.

My question is, in both cases, my ride took the drivers well outside of their existing working area. The first was working downtown on a Saturday night, and found himself in a quiet subdivision out in the suburbs. The second was working a quiet subdivision, and found himself 45 minutes away (from home?) in a bustling suburb at midnight.

OTOH, the driver is utilized and getting paid for a long period of time. After all, buying in bulk is good for Charmin, at least.

Does this Lyft usage hurt drivers?","Give me one idiot or set of idiots to deal with for an hour over 3-4 sets of idiots for an hour every day of the week. I love long rides as a driver. No not at all, a lot of drivers rather do a long 45 minutes ride vs multiple small 10 minutes. You never know how far the drive is really from home. I live in Miami, Florida but not south beach or downtown area, about 30 minutes inwards. I love to drive around those areas, and when I get rides to my area I go straight home afterwards it’s great! I prefer long rides tbh. If there was a way to filter it so I only get rides that are about an hour or so long, I'd glad take them all, regardless of how far the person is going This is preferred, imo. Longer drives mean more money as it's just a straight shot. Four 10 minute rides in an hour in the city will net you about 12-17 bucks. A 60 minute 55 mile ride in an hour, on the freeway, will net you about 53 bucks. 

So yes, some drivers like long rides even if you take us far from home.

Honestly far from home = more money. Yes they have a lower net profit margin than short rides when expenses are calculated. Whoever says no obviously doesn’t understand the economics behind their rate card (driver pay). Longer rides!! It depends on the driver and what they’re looking for.

Lyft (currently) leans on paying more for mileage than time, so a longer distance ride pays better than a shorter ride consuming a lot of time.

Some drivers are trying to meet quotas. Express drivers have a 20 ride a week minimum. Newbies may have a ride challenge.  When I am trying to meet these goals, I prefer shorter and shared rides. 

But often times it’s a monetary goal. So whatever combination of rides gets us there faster.  I personally would rather drive two riders 60+ miles and make my goal rather than hope 17 short rides gets me there. As the others have said, a longer high mileage ride is better than a short low mile time consuming ride. On top of that, if the driver is tracking their miles for taxes, it’s almost like being paid twice, once for the fare, and once for the tax write-off. 

As long as the rider realizes that the long trip does take us out of our preferred area and tips accordingly, it’s all good. A 140 mile trip for $125 plus a $35 tip works. A 130 mile trip for $115 and a $10 tip doesn’t. Keep in mind that back to back shortish rides are the best way for drivers to make money and some will not want to do these kind of long rides. Also keep in mind that it’s not your problem. Bad no. 

Profitability is a reach. Most long rides you barely break even."
"Lyft Express Drive sucks 2018 ford focus, new car smell brand new... I was online the other day for about 10 hours and 20 minutes.. only made 137$ and this is after filling up the tank twice total of 50$ and only recieved a 2$ tip once. My car is being fixed so I decided to do this... scam!!!",45,93.99527653339284,Lyft,Image,"Dog walkers in my city advertise for $40 an hour. lyft express drive is for homeless people.  You get a free car to sleep and live in and you will take every ride lyft gives you to keep your house.  The same is true for Uber Fair you were online less than 11 hours and you filled up 2 times? you are doing something wrong. Assuming you just started, these results are to be expected if you accept every single request. Lyft will take advantage of your acceptance rating, even sending you a ""shame on you"" text message for not responding to a request. You either work for Lyft, or for yourself. Hint: accepting every request means you're working for lyft, who doesn't give one single shit about your resources. The Focus is not a great Uber/Lyft vehicle. The dual-clutch trans is not known for reliability, and the back seat is not know for roominess, which is probably one reason why you're not getting many tip.

One of the reasons the Prius is so desirable for this gig, besides fuel economy, is that it is decently spacious and is very durable. It’s not a scam. You agreed to it. 

Express drive has a lower rate. You have to drive full time r/titlegore It would of been better to tell us the mpg you did or the total miles driven and gallons used.

That doesn't seem bad if express pays less... I mean a Friday Night I tend to never start before 9pm because it's a waste of time. So I'm sure if you kept driving around aimlessly prior to 9 then you wasted fuel and did no rides... I normally make $150 and use half a tank in my suv and only work 6hrs... So it sounds like poor planning more than anything. Express Drive is fine. I'm not running my personal vehicle into the ground. All the minor interior scatches or stains aren't on my car. I don't pay for maintenance or insurance. I've been in various makes and models to finally stick with Hyundai Sonata's. Rideshare in general is mostly stress free, no schedule, no deadlines. Know your mpg and only fill up what you need"

When i started in 2014 I made close to 100k a year in San Francisco but these days when I drive maybe once a week I’m shocked to see how low they pay us and they charge the passengers way more then what they claim the per mile rate is. So now they charge a commission of 25% of whatever the per mile/minute rate is in your city then they charge a booking fee of over 2$ in all markets and now they overcharge the passengers with the upfront price scam which is whatever they feel like charging. It’s not based if mile or minutes for the passengers anymore it’s just a pure scam operation basically they raised rates without telling us or passengers. That proves that customers are ok with paying higher fares when the whole time we begged them to raise rates and they told us they can’t because customers would stop using the service. BULLSHIT"

I live in Kalamazoo, Michigan which is a pretty accepting place but I'm still really nervous. I'm actually starting the job to be able to present as female more often, which is impossible at my current job due to fear of my coworkers being unaccepting of me. It's a place with a lot of older people who enjoy making jokes about things they really shouldn't. The stuff I've heard here makes me really uncomfortable and my therapist even suggested a different place of work before I fully transition. I'm also not doing so well with voice training yet, but I'm trying my best. It's difficult to do so when I'm forced to go full guy mode all day at work.

 I'm also concerned about having signed up with my legal name, but hoping to change my name to what I currently go by. They're currently doing the background check on me, so should I wait until I'm accepted to change my name in the app?

 Apologies if this isn't allowed here, I'm just nervous and hoping to hear from others who may relate.","The safest thing to do is not mention it to any rider, ever. This job is already not very safe and has some crazy riders, and your safety should be the #1 concern. Its against Lyft TOS, but carry a weapon or some mace.

Contact Lyft customer service and explain your situation, and ask them to change your profile name to your preferred name, as I don't believe you can change it yourself. It may not be possible for them to change it either, it might have to match your social security information... If this is the case, its safer to just dress neutral.

The truth is most riders will not even look at you or your profile and will automatically assume you are male, just because you are a rideshare driver. Happens all the time with me... Its up to you if you want to correct them or not.

If anyone comments on your voice being masculine, just laugh and say ""Yea I hear that sometimes"". Just be friendly and you should be fine.  75% pax will not care about interacting with you and will just want to get from A to B.  The other 25% would like to have a conversation about anything.  Some people like to talk.  You might even make a connection with someone who is going through a similar situation.  Go get audio books on communication, body language and psychology to listen to between rides.  This is a service job and if you provide great service, with or without talking, you'll have a good experience.  There are a-holes out there.  Just brush them off and rate them appropriately.  Good luck! Cis female here, but I can answer a couple questions. 

You can change your name on your own! Download the passenger app and whatever you put in there will change your driver info. I’ve done it before. 

When it asks you to upload your photo, definitely do it as close as you want to look while driving. 99% of people don’t pay attention to the photo, but in ~2500 rides I’ve had a couple people comment on the fact that I’m wearing glasses in my photo and not while I drive. So basically just don’t give them anything to be dumb about. 

Get used to hearing “omg I’ve never had a female driver before!” and “aren’t you nervous doing this?!” Also get a dashcam that records inside the car as well as outside and put up the relevant warning signs. It should discourage people from being dicks and if not, you’ve got proof of bullshit if you need it. 

I’m in Boston and like I said, not trans, but after almost two years doing Lyft I can count on one hand the number of people that have *really* made me feel unsafe. Most people just don’t pay attention to their driver. They’re chatting with their friends or have headphones on or just don’t want to talk. 

Best of luck! Howdy!  I’ve had zero issues whatsoever for being mtf.  Though have had some creeps.  You should go for it, cause worst case scenario it doesn’t and you can quit whenever you want You can’t change your photo, and I wouldn’t suggest driving at all. One group of drunk kids, and you could have a really, really bad night. In the end, like all risks in life....is the risk worth the reward?


Pro answer.....NO You want gender equality? Don’t mention it, ever. You don’t hear cis males or females being nervous to encounter the general public because of their gender. Sounds like you have a problem being honest with yourself."

Checking charges,9,95.69834366307767,Lyft,"Hi y'all, so I recently had an idea and set up something that'd work for me, and I wanted to gauge interest to see if making a template and releasing it would work, and also if folks had any useful tips for me.

Here's the gist of it. I have a flyer with a QR code and little pull-tabs with a shortened link that I'm gonna put in my car. The code and link direct to a Google Form where folks can fill out a date, time, and amount they paid for the ride. Also if they took Uber or Lyft. That then populates a spreadsheet, where I can go in and punch in what I got paid for each ride. The spreadsheet will automatically spit out what percentage I got paid for each ride. I made the spreadsheet viewable by a link that's given when the form is completed, and uploaded it to my Google Drive, so folks who ask ""how much does Uber/Lyft pay you?"" can have an exact answer. I'm thinking that small-picture, I could hold Uber and Lyft accountable if they try to short me, and big-picture maybe if enough data gets gathered from enough folks, it could be compiled and published.

Thoughts? Should I put together a set of templates so folks could download it, tweak the flyer, and collect their own data?",I doubt pax want to become accountants for the duration of their rides You can already select a ride and See Earnings Breakdown to see what passengers paid. Literally no one cares.
I arranged my first ride. They are to be here around 4. Is there a way to text or call the driver? I see nothing in the app and I've clicked all things clickable. Thanks.,14,95.99307745938776,Lyft,Driver has been confirmed but there is not way to contact them.,"The driver will be there near the time you arranged the ride. Why do you need to text or call them before? Seems like you already got your answer, but as a general FYI the driver who claimed the ride might not actually be the one who shows up. There are a few reasons this could happen but it mostly boils down to Lyft being dumb. This is why you can’t contact the driver until they’re actually en route. 

Also as a heads up, make sure the people being picked up are ready to go at the beginning of your scheduled window because wait times are inconsistent. I picked up a scheduled ride once where the woman had picked something like 4:25-4:40. I got there 10 minutes early and the countdown started at that point (we have a timer that has to run out before we can get a no show fee); the timer ran out at like 4:32 and told me I could go. Don’t panic about it, but don’t count on them having until the very last second to get out to the car. Sigh, you don't need to bother the driver. You have no clue how damn annoying that is."

"Should i be accepting every ride and gas consumption tips? (LA, San Diego, Inland Empire)",11,96.93700107055406,Lyft,"I'm a new 3 weeks in Lyft Express driver learning the in and outs of Lyft. I feel like ive made the money I need in the past 3 weeks as my personal expenses are very low. So the Express program works well for me. 
Being a business minded person, I still try to do anything to keep my Lyft expenses (gas) low. 

What are some tips from the vets of Lyft can teach me to keep costs low? 

Also, I'm trying to figure out why I would not accept a ride or in what cases I wouldn't? Seems like I wouldn't want to deny one. 

Thanks for any help! 🙏","Is express the one the you rent the vehicle? if so out of curiosity what are you paying for that.  Also no you should not be accepting every trip anything over 5 to 7 minutes away is most likely a loser.

 Don't offer anything outside of you driving them from point A to point B and do not make stops longer than a minute or 2 You and I seem to think in similar ways. Here are a few gas saving tips I've picked up on...  


&nbsp;


1) Brake as little as possible. Look farther down the road. If you see a traffic signal, stop sign, or sharp turn that you'll need to slow down or stop for, let off the accelerator and coast until you reach it. On four lane roads change lanes if it looks like someone is slowing down to turn. Use your breaks a little as you can.  


&nbsp;


2) Use gravitational potential energy and momentum to your favor. If you're cresting a big hill, your speed should be well below the speed limit at the top so as to be just barely over the speed limit when you hit the valley. If there is a stop sign at a valley, stop a car length or so before the stop sign and use gravity to help get you moving again. Conversely, if there is a stop sign at the crest of a hill, use momentum (if you still have some, see rule #1) to travel as far past the stop sign as you feel safe doing.  


&nbsp;


3) The most fuel efficient speed limit for my vehicle is somewhere around 50 mph so I want to travel as close to that speed as is reasonable. If the speed limit is below 50 mph then I'm willing to speed by about 4 mph. If the speed limit is above that, I usually go 3-5 below the posted speed limit.  


&nbsp;


4) Accelerate reasonable quickly. Generally, the sooner you get up to that fuel efficient speed the better. That's assuming you don't have a stop light or something you'll need to brake for soon. Furthermore, there is a maximum speed you can travel so accelerating quickly is the only real variable in how fast you can get from point A to point B. And the faster you can get from point A to Point B, the more trips you can pack into a specified amount of time and the more money you'll make.  


&nbsp;


I can't tell how much of an effect any single one of these items has on fuel mileage as this is mostly theoretical, but when I'm consciously trying to increase my mileage I can usually improve by 5-7 mpg.  


&nbsp;


When it comes to whether or not to accept certain rides, it just kind of depends. If it's a really busy time and I'm not having to wait long between rides then I usually won't accept rides over 4-5 minutes or so. If it's kind of dead I may go out as far as 9 minutes but I typically don't go over that.  


&nbsp;


Also, if you haven't done so yet, also sign up for Uber to reduce the amount of downtime between rides. The number of trips you are able to make is the biggest factor in how much you'll earn.  


&nbsp;


Lastly, if you see rideshare driving as something you plan to do long term I'd encourage you to buy a fuel efficient used car rather than driving Lyft Express for extended periods of time."
Is Metro PCS good for driving with Lyft?,6,96.95870245944296,Lyft,Is Metro PCS a good phone service to have while driving for Lyft? Anybody have problems with it while navigating?,"Back in2015, I used to drive Uber with a shitty Chinese android using Virgin Mobil as my service provider. I think you'll be fine. Metro isn’t good for anything I've always used Metro for Uber and Lyft with an Android phone. For about two years I also had a personal iPhone with Verizon.

If Metro lost signal on a hill or canyon, the Verizon iPhone lost signal as well. Metro works just as good as the others for a fraction of the cost. i use track phone wireless .  and safe link  . its the same service its very good here in detroit my bill is only 15 a month"

I've also heard they started just giving them away, before the 250 rides just because they want the advertisements in the car.

Have questions. Lyft suspended me because of false allegation that I was driving under the influence.,30,97.06470940391223,Lyft,"I had 2 passengers in my Lyft vehicle yesterday. It was a fairly normal ride until I dropped them off. The only strange thing is despite what the GPS told me. The customers intentionally took me on the longer route for some reason. I followed their instructions and upon asking them why I should navigate differently from the GPS one of the guys said this was a faster way and I replied ""oh ok. You know google dosent necessarily choose the faster route all the time"" so I thought nothing off it.


As soon as I dropped the passengers off the guy got his stuff out and he said ""just so you know it's pretty  obvious that your intoxicated/high""

Me being stunned at such a accusation asked him ""why do you think I'm under the influence?"" And he said ""it's just obvious dude"" and I said "" I promise you I'm not high. I dont know why you think that""

And he said ""well just for future reference. It's ok because I directed you to our home safely but yah its obvious"".

I did not swerve or drive recklessly. And at the most I was going 5 over the speed limit"".

As soon as I could I called my local police different department explained that I was Lyft driver and asked them if there be anyway they can breathalyzer me and administer some sort of test.

Officers came to my location. I blew a perfect 0.00 and the officer on duty said that there was no reason for him to suspect I was on anything or under the influence.

My account is suspended because of some baseless accusation. I'm in between jobs right now. And this is my only source of income until then.

I got this blue card from the police to show they responded and a picture of the breathalyzer.

I have forwarded my story and into Lyft and forwarded attachments of the breathalyzer and ""police report"" they gave me.

I have no idea why these people would do this. They did try and make small talk with me and I'm a naturally introverted person so I didnt talk much. Maybe they got pissed that I wasnt making actual conversation with them.

Every now and than I would look at my GPS and the guy would be like ""it's okay dude I know where were were going"" which I found weird.


Tbh I picked these people up from a July 4th pool party. They brought a cooler and speaker from the house and the passengers themselves seemed a little intoxicated but I have no of proof that.

The thing is if you suspected your driver of truly being under the influence why wouldn't you try and cancel the trip or demand to be immediately dropped off rather than wait until you got to your destination?

Why weren't the police called on me immediately?

It is absolutely ridiculous. The only thing that slightly went wrong is that it was raining and I was turning left at one point my tires spun on a wet spot of  the road but I didn't lose control of the car or anything.

If Lyft removes me as  a driver I'm fucking screwed at earning any income until I find a job.


Have any Lyft drivers dealt with this before? Will I still get removed because of some baseless accusation?

And how long will Lyft support take to deal with this matter?","These stories drive me crazy. What these scumbags did constitutes defamation per se. They caused you emotional distress, wasted your time and hurt your income by making a false statement to your client. You should seriously look into getting a lawyer, and pursuing legal action against these clowns. False accusations like that are no fucking joke. In the meantime sign up with Uber. they will reactivate you this is very common pax trying to get free rides .

my advice you need money bad  right ?   hit pizza places go in talk to them get paid cash daily . skip big franchises go  to mom and pop pizza places  . also call  your chineese restaurants some of them are always looking for drivers .    this will pay the bills until lyft gets it figured out . i think in 24 hours you will be back on the road . Same thing has happened to me and I was able to convince lyft critical response team the passenger was full of shit what you should have done was contacted lyft and told them the passenger was rude drunk and disorderly and continued doing rides it would have helped your case I was only suspended for a few hours. And now that rider no longer allowed to ride on the platform The less you say the better. You did nothing wrong. You have no reason to explain anything other than, “I wasn’t under the influence and have proof of that.” Period. Period....... that’s all you need to say. This sucks man, I don’t know how to help, but maybe go ahead and get the mall rolling on signing up for Uber so you can still work while this gets resolved?
Good luck though! They wanted a free ride, my dude. It happens constantly, I **highly doubt** they actually thought you were intoxicated. 

Get two way dash cams asap, and good on you for the police report. You'll get your account back, don't worry. It's a bit strange. Scammers don't usually tell you, giving you a chance to defend yourself. And a dashcam will be useful.

Maybe they never ride in a Lyft and never use GPS. You are DUI because you don't know the best route???

I was try-and-erroring to get out of a huge parking lot at the harbor, driving into an exit look like thing at night with no lighting. The pax ask me if I'm drunk. I was in the place for the 1st time and even for the 10th time, I won't bother to remember the layout of the place. GPS is totally useless because there's no road to direct you around. So I drove fast hugging the concrete barrier, the sober test version for drivers. Someone said the same thing about me a few years ago. I emails Lyft back telling them I don't drink. They reinstated my account instantly. Honestly, they probably didn’t want to pay for that ride, or at the very least they wanted free ride credits. Send all of your story and documentation to the email. Team will respond as they are able. call in via Critical Response line and ask nicely to speak with Trust and Safety. They will reactivate your account within 48 hours I had same problem If you ever needed a better reason to quit this occupation, this is it. I responded to allegations of reckless driving in lawyerese and they honestly didn’t know what to do other than insist I drive carefully. Yeah whatever, they honestly don’t care. Your police interaction was great and the best proof you could ask for. Might think about sending your pax a copy of that 0.0 with your reinstatement. They’ll message you about the accusation. Your ban is only 24 hours. Respectfully but firmly stick to your story and you should be reactivated. You already signed up for Uber but also sign up for food delivery services as well. You need to stay afloat and for me I got approved for delivery services faster. Do not obsess on the why they did what they did. The most glaring rationale is they were assholes. The world is chock full of them. Naive to believe someone would not do this just because..... honestly for what those people do, I started lyft last week, as soon as I was accepted, to uber and lyft, I purchased a dual camera both ways in and out of the car. I read so many stories like these. it worry’s me. honestly for accusation like this, I would’ve called the cops in front of them and made the test in front of them, maybe they will be questioned by the cops too and hope they get deactivated too. but lyft shouldn’t have a problem with you if you got a proof. Good luck with Uber. I only do Uber Eats now. You can keep busy steadily from 6:30am-9:30am, 11am-1:30pm and 6pm-9pm, usually back to back stacked rides for those blocks.

It's so, so less stressful and people usually tip! 

Good luck! I was recently deactivated because I had a no show whom I collected the $5 fee from accused me of denying them a ride because they had an animal with them and I was acting hostile towards them. 6 hours later, I was reactivated because Lyft couldn't get any proof from the pax over what they accused me.

People are pieces of shit. I used to love doing Lyft but now I'm desperately trying to find a more stable job. You're lying. You were high. Based on your post history, you appear to be heavy user of marijuana and psychedelic drugs. You know damn well a breathalyzer test won't prove shit. Maybe you should be sober when driving people around."
What am I doing right? I keep seeing pictures of really shitty earnings. Mine have gone down over the last year but 1k for less than 40 hrs of work is still pretty standard for me. (Seattle),24,97.39480199650481,Lyft,Image,"Base $21 an  hour is great. I'd still be driving if that's what I continued to make. But, like others have commented, many of us started with decent results, which declined week by week, giving the same amount of rides. I live in Phoenix AZ now, but raised in Seattle and I can imagine it's a better market than most. Also, you do need to be commended on your tips, on that, you ARE doing something right. High demand, Lyft must be pulling more demand than Uber there to hit that many rides. Sitting here in Denver for 30 minutes now I’m the most popular area, no ride requests, I rarely get more than 50 rides in a week 30-40 hours Wow do people in Seattle tip very well or was this a lucky week in tips for you.

Here in Los Angeles people are stingy as fuck when it comes to tips.

And my weekly bonus is usually like $110 for 108 rides, and the bonus is given to me like 1 week out of the month.

And streak bonus are very scarce out in Los Angeles Uber and Lyft are both just games. It's about when you drive, where you're at, and what you accept. You know how to play the game, most people don't. Outside of a select few markets, if you aren't making $20+ an hour, you're doing something wrong. Demand of your area. I live in Seattle driving for Lyft part-time and I haven’t seen a ride challenge bonus in years. It’s always been earnings guarantees. Seattle is a great market though. How do find this summary in the Lyft website? I live in the Inland Empire area in California. I'm 45 mins from LA, 1 hour and 30 mins from San Diego and 1 hour from the beaches. I think it has to do with the areas you drive in honestly. This is like a game and it's a very strategic game. I've made $60 in 6 hrs and I've made $120 in 6 hrs. Gotta learn the spots in your area to hit. Beaches do very well just to let y'all know too. 

Thanks for sharing your earnings keep it going."

I look at the pictures, and it's really the same picture repeated three times, a giant wet spot in the center of the back seat. I show my husband and we are both confused. Ok...we think, you know we just came back from the gym...maybe it was his wet pool clothes in his bag. Even though the clothes were wrapped in a plastic bag AND put in a tote bag...AND  the bag wasn't wet or damp at the bottom..we both just assumed...crap...clearly that must've been us. It felt a little suspect but we were like, ugh...ok whatever. I'm annoyed with him for not being mindful and he is understanding. I write Lyft back and and mention that 50.00 seems excessive for what is probably just a water spot and I waited to see what Lyft replied back with. I figured they'd go into about how much the driver gets charged to clean it and yadda yadda, I was prepared to concede because this had never happened and I like to take responsibility for myself and my Lyft guests like an adult. But the email I got was not what I was expecting. Lyft emails me back and basically says, hey the driver just sent us a receipt of the cleaning cost and you'll be charged an extra 12.00 bucks...so look out for the receipt. Also the driver identified the spilt liquid as coffee. Also the claim is closed but if you want to re-open it you can. So....here's the thing. Neither my partner nor myself had any coffee. We were coming back from a gym. When I ordered the Lyft I actually put in the gym's name. All we had on us was a bottle of water, I had my purse on me, and he had his tote bag with his wrapped pool clothes. I'm actually astonished. Not only did Lyft just flat out let a driver just file a fraudulent claim...in what's best described as a he said / she said situation they basically have no process. Driver claims I spilled coffee, even though I had no coffee and my husband had no coffee, Lyft doesn't care about silly evidence, they just go ahead and CHARGE my card, send me a receipt, and tell me the case is closed. I've replied back to them and hit them up on twitter. It's honestly not about the money but damn. I'm nervous about using their service anymore now. Like what's to stop other drivers from just randomly deciding they want to file a damage claim? What if I have another perfectly fine ride one day by myself and go about my day and find myself charged for some random damage fee? Clearly there isn't any process...it honestly seems illegal that a company can just willy nilly charge you money, send you a receipt, and say that you were charged money because you damaged something...and that's it. How is Lyft or drivers held accountable for taking the money of people who didn't cause any damage? I'm seriously considering filing a police report for theft and just getting things on record because it's really unsettling. I really liked their service..but now...I may just have to figure some other way of getting around :/","Can you check the photos to see what the time stamp is? I’m a driver and we’re supposed to report damage either within 6 hours or before we pick up our next passenger, whichever is first. If the photos were taken well after you got dropped off it’s likely he had another passenger who caused the damage. I doubt they’ll change their verdict, but you could maybe get them to review the driver’s ride history and find out whether he had other rides after you and didn’t follow the rules.

 I say “rules” but they’re wildly inconsistent in how they apply these things. I had a passenger knowingly give her kid a leaking water bottle and it spilled all over the backseat. I didn’t realize until she was getting the kid out of the car and said “why is the seat wet? Oh right his bottle was open.” Called Lyft to complain, sent in photos of my soaking wet seat, and got $15. Which is obviously not the same as your driver got initially. Lyft is dumb.

As to how they’re allowed to do this, it’s probably buried in the TOS somewhere that by using Lyft you agree to them charging you for “damage” or whatever the hell else they felt like including. You can dispute the charge with your bank/credit card, but it will get you banned from Lyft. i h ad a pax pee in my seat last week . she was charged just 50 dollars i thought it  should of been 200.

 my advice to  the poster of this . i would call your credit card explain you did not do the damage they will refund the charges BUT you will need to use a different credit card for lyft and a new account . 

or set up a uber account  . uber is typically a bit cheaper anyways I had a guy drool on mmy seats and left a puddle. Nothing from lyft. 4 incidents and counting with no compensation.

Lyft kind of blows"
This has gone too far lol,21,97.62299644097133,Lyft,Image,"This is why I will only drive for lyft if Uber is dead.  That rarely happens.  I make close to 110 a day doing maybe six to seven rides.  About to dump Lyft all together. My market has been like that since September but somehow lyft keeps on going here. I’ve even checked response times and prices on the rider app. It’s comparable. The few times I’ve used lyft I have not been picked up in a rental. I honestly can’t explain it. Our city GM knows this and exploits this to the lowest possible margin of incentives possible. 


Insanity. I will tell you this, you keep on messing with the driver pay, it just takes one to go postal on the office. I personally am just making an observation but these full timers drive 70 hours and get angrier and angrier yet don’t leave. It will become like the movie Taxi Driver at some point. stupid lyft . how does those demand zones help us  again ? thanks will just drive uber it's because Lyft is run by drivers who rent their cars from *gasp* lyft and their local rental agency.  Drivers have no choice but to do rides with no surge.

Uber has wised up and partnered with Fair.  It's coming soon to Uber also.  thousands of tiny Kia compact ubers driven by homeless people who get a free car to make money and sleep in. Yup, July 4th 2017 I made $400 with Lyft, a year later I made <$100. Today I only drove for Uber and made $340 even after going to the wrong spots. So I understand what’s going on here, but a couple questions:

1. Is the demand on Uber THAT much higher? I’ve been told it’s 5 to 1 here.

2. Or is Lyft charging pax up the yinyang and not passing it on to drivers? What gives with those fancy orange arrows?? I don't get those 😭😭😭
Here's mine right after the fireworks ended...
http://imgur.com/I6tUq4q I don't ever see surges like that driving for Uber. And yet the poor express drivers still do it, because they HAVE TO in order to have a car at all. Complete abuse of underprivileged immigrants, Lyft is a severely abusive organization that exploits the poor & needy. SHUT IT DOWN!!!!! Lyft cyaan suck mi rasss."

Is there a way I can communicate with the driver?,2,97.74674644098238,Lyft,"Is there a way within the app I can write a note to the driver? I made the arrangements for 2 people in the app on my phone but I won't be riding in the car.  I wanted to let them know the 2 people they will be picking up so they don't expect to be picking me up.

And also want to give them better directions to the pick up address. If they go by GPS, they will get confused.",Why didn’t the riders schedule the ride?
I will always cancel on passengers that have a baby and no car seat or booster. I call support right away and get paid $5 each time.,19,97.7918737557972,Lyft,Image,"Nice earnings for just over 3 hours, what city? You call support? Oddly enough, I just had to deny a woman a ride because she didn't have a child car seat for her little boy.

She told me to cancel the ride but then told me she would report me if I cancelled the ride lol. All through text messages as well. I'll make a post about it when I catch a breather from driving people around. Always works for me too... does it not work for some? How do you call support? Make the pax cancel or wait 5 and no show. Then follow up with support to CYA From my experience, the best way to automatically get the cancellation fee is to wait 5, cancel, collect $5, and drive.  However, I would rather have pax cancel before that.   I explain the law, and that they are going to be charged cancellation fee no matter what.  They are welcome for me to wait out the timer, but then I will be forced to report them to Lyft/Uber as a safety violation.  It will sometimes work, and they will cancel in hopes of getting another driver willing to take them.

If not, I drive a safe distance away (if pax getting unruly), and text them this: 
“ Parents: If you do not have a car seat or booster seat for your child (GA Law for 7 & under), please CANCEL this ride request. I will not break the law for you. It's not worth it to me to risk your child's safety. If I arrive and you have no child seat or booster seat, Uber/Lyft will charge you a cancellation fee, and I will have to report you as a safety hazard.”

I also follow up with an in-app Help With This Ride report. But why do we have to contact support each time ?? There is an option to cancel if pax doesn't have a car seat, does Lyft not reimburse you for choosing it like Uber does ?? If they're my daughter's size I usually just offer them the one in my trunk. If not, no go. But thankfully I haven't run into this yet. I get this issue at least once a week.. Cancel after 5 minutes get your fee and drive. 
Below is a video of 3 ways to handle problem, but Only One is Correct!

https://youtu.be/33daI3q2MYI I’m gonna use that trick next time :)"
1st time user - scheduling for 2 elderly. Are there hidden fees no incluced in what I see when mapping out the ride?,2,97.89754505209348,Lyft,"To go from here to there, I see a price of 36.01. Does that price include all fees and taxes, etc or is that all that would need to be paid?

If I put credit card info in the app, do I need to do anything else...does the charge automatically come off the credit card or would I have to manually send it in after the ride? I assume I'd have a bill? I'm also reading I can't pay with  cash right?

Thanks.","The price you see when choosing the ride type is the actual price you pay, and if you change your pickup location, you'll be immediately shown if it alters your trip price. After you finish your ride, you can tip your driver in the rate and pay screen and will then be shown the total price being charged to your card. It's all automatic, you finish your ride, it's charged to whatever card you've put into the app, and you get emailed a receipt. No cash, nothing else you have to do."
I start to apply for lyft and it asked me a social security number but accidentally I putted wrong social security number and I already submitted so they didn’t send a background check I need to change mine social security number. how do I change that??,3,97.95837838544062,Lyft,,got to your local Lyft Hub and have them send you something to re enter your ssn leave it alone ? i put a question mark for a reason . if it went through   what would happen when it was tax time ?  would that be turned into the irs ? hmmm   not in your name . would this be a good or bad thing for you ? never pay taxes simple mistake like i said question mark So I just have to leave it I already delete my account so I can apply again with the correct social security number. It says like issue with driving record even though I uploaded all the documents and it won’t let me go online. Is there anyone I could get in private?
Can a driver get more than one scheduled pickup in their queue?,2,97.9952649595147,Lyft,"I just realized while I've done several scheduled pickups, I've never had more than ONE pickup scheduled at any given time.  I have a airport ride scheduled for in the morning.  Is it possible for me to get an offer for a scheduled ride at some point this EVENING?","Yes, it’s possible. I try and line my early airport scheduled rides so they are as close as possible to being back to back. Never seen it once"
Why don't people tip?,22,98.01962838545165,Lyft,Do I need a sign?,"Why do people not tip at any service being provided? Who knows. If you provide a service you get a tip, $1 is a tip. If you do something exceptional you get more. Not tipping anything is just being a cheap ass. stop fucking stressing about tips stop being a idiot and think for a second 

these pax use this service daily  they cant afford to tip the driver every trip .

take your self to the airport then its 90% of the fares tip .

would you tip every time you used this service 2 o 3 times a day ?   no you would not .

lets use our brain think about it for a few .

ever notice new users usually always tip or bar people or somebody picking up there car ?

they are not using this service daily yes get a big  sigh  ( please tip your driver ) think it will help ? or do you think it will kill your ratings ?

if you so hard up get a tip jar cut a slot in it put it in plain view of the passengers  so they can put in loose change .  do you think it will make any difference at all ? When Lyft and Uber first started, they advertised that the driver got most of the $ for the trip and so there was no need to tip.  In the early days, one of them didn't even have a tip option in the app.  Uber and Lyft have taught their long-time users that tipping isn't necessary. > Do I need a sign?

I always tip in cash (unless the ride was horrifically bad). But if you had a sign asking for tips, I wouldn’t tip you at all.

A tip shouldn’t be expected. A driver with a sign asking for tips would make me think they were entitled and expect one, so they wouldn’t get one from me. Cause they cheap as hell... case closed Well if people are using it everyday, 2/4 times a day. Thats a majority of people in SF and I'm sure other big cities.

You cant expect these people to tip every time they take a lyft. That's why you have to provide an exceptional experience, good driving, conversation, cleanliness, etc. 

Its also why people may just tip a buck or two. It all depends on the person. Before being a driver, I thought most people tip like I do, but that is not the case. I drove one girl about 2 blocks and she tipped $2, while a guy I drove for an hour and half in full traffic tipped nothing. Initially I saw tipping with new tablet I placed for pax, but now I never see tipping anymore.  I'm like this stuff is wils and spontaneous. Access your riders when you greet them. Are they social and chatty? Actively participate and listen and be polite and entertaining.  If you aren't in a good mood, don't drive. Are they quiet/ putting  in earbuds/ focusing on their phone? Greet and verify then quietly take them from point a to b. If they are on a phone call or make a phone call enroute, turn the music down for them. Hot? AC. Cold? Reasonable heat.Have extra charger cords available (iPhone, micro, usb-c) and a multiport charger to use if someone needs it. Keep the car clean and fresh. Try to adjust music to what you think will be acceptable and public-friendly. I see 65-75% of my riders will tip me either on the spot or over the next 24 hours via app. Signs are a waste in my experience. Just talk to them like normal people. Try it!!! wrg, converse infinitely any and any be perfect"

LIke it's this person's  job to prosecute drivers, This is good news, because it shows they are doing their part to verify of driver did indeed refuse a service dog.  Many people lie just to get a ride for their pets. Sometimes, I honestly wonder if Lyft is somehow getting accounts confused in their system. I’ve been cited for “speeding” and I hadn’t driven a passenger in four days. Then I had another issue, and the Lyft representative had the information of a totally different car, and said I lived in a totally different state. yeah, but why did they deactivate before they knew?
They assume you're guilty before the investigation and deactivate?
Typical lyft, no respect for us drivers. 
Did they reimburse you for the money you couldn't make yesterday?'

LOL As a passenger I when I have my dog on me. (Pet not service) - I text first notifying the driver that I have a dog. Then I call and hang up quickly because I know it messes with your navigation but will draw attention to your phone so you see that I have a dog on me. From there the driver either shows up or I respectfully cancel on my end. Basically,  I don't like wasting time with a driver arriving and then refusing the dog....

Of course, there's no pleasing some drivers though. Someone is always going to be upset no matter what you do. [removed] **LYFT ATTITUDE** (summed up):

*pax writes a message to Lyft on the app, and says some nasty lying  bullsh#t about a driver*

**LYFT (to the lying pax):** ""oh we are so sorry your majesty, its totally our driver's fault, may we kiss your @ss some more?""

**LYFT (to the honest, hardworking driver):** ""you total piece of scum, we are going to start off by believe the pax OVER you.  You are a suspended.  We hate you! you are just here until we can replace you with self-driving cars! go f#ck yourself, and too bad, while we investigate the lying pax, you get no ability to earn.  hahahaha!! we LOVE f#cking you over.   Too bad driver, you can't do anything so just suck our b@lls""

*...also Lyft (to its drivers)*

**LYFT:** ""we care about our drivers so much"" I think Lyft is little too much. They actually have no way to confirm that's what you did or did not do. 

They most likely just deactivate everyone and use that as credibility that they took the necessarily steps to avoid a lawsuit. Just call and request to be Transferred to Trust & Safety

Make sure to ask those two questions because 95% of the time they aren't service animals. I was reported at least 5 times by people who didn't actually have service animals.

Either the pax goes “oh ok/dang it screw you!!/but but but...”  and you drive off or put the dog away somewhere...or they say “sir/ma’am this is a service animal” and you open your door and let them in 

I honestly am too fearful to even ask the legal questions we technically we are allowed to ask (what service does your dog perform/is this a service animal) 

Just open the door and welcome them in You’ll be back in 48h It’s gonna be 48 hours that’s how lyft does it Update: I received a reply from them via email regarding this matter. Since they were unable to find any proof that I broke lyft's animal policy, my account has been reactivated :D

"Recently Lyft changed its style. Now it's completely denying all customer service complaints even when complaints are significant, shocking, and justified.

&#x200B;

Someone high up in the customer service department is leading Lyft down the wrong path. Now it's just become Uber, who in my experience has long been known as unresponsive to customers' feedback. Lyft just lost the essence that differentiated it from Uber: being classy, engaged with its customer base, listening to customer's feedback and offering actual solutions--when warranted, in the form of refunds or credits. Now it blanket denies everything with multiple reps speaking the same lines which even substance wise are ridiculous on the face of it.

A group left their take out in my car which spilled over and made my car smell of bad chinese food. Nothing from lyft.

Have you considered a taxi? When people raise questions about ""how many complaints"" you've submitted it's probably because your contacts with Lyft are all on a list ""of sorts"" as someone who repeatedly asked for a refunds. May I ask how many refunds you've received in the past? I absolutely hate when pax complain about directions. Lyft won't charge you extra if the driver took an alternative route, unless the difference is significant in miles traveled.
With that being said, I agree with you on what Lyft had become, but what you don't understand is that these companies mirror our behaviour as people. Pax don't want to pay extra to see their drivers pull up in better cars providing better service. Plus, a lot of people have been pulling this ""I had a bad experience with the driver"" stunt complaints to get refunds or credits, so Lyft isn't falling for it anymore. How many significant, shocking and justified service complaints did you have recently?

I agree Lyft CS sucks, but I only need to contact them once or twice a month, tops. 

Troll much? > I've had multiple customer service reps

Ok Karen... Define *Independent Contractor*. The complaint resolution centers, driver ratings, driver rating auto termination levels (currently at 84% ), are not how independent contractors are treated, it's how employees are treated. Lyft needs to beef up and make easier their *unpairing* function between drivers and passengers, and leave it at that. DRIVERS ARE NOT LYFT EMPLOYEES. I agree. Today I had a shared ride and they tried to screw me as usual by only paying for one passenger. Tonight after calling a  customer twice and them not showing up after waiting 10 minutes I pressed No Show and left. Called lift twice, the first idiot, Michael insisted that I had cancelled the trip. The second moron said his name Richard and hung up on me before I even told him my name. So, I am taking the day off tomorrow. 
You know that stupid survey after sending in a complaint. Yep Lyft really gives a shit about you.
After what happened to Lyft and Uber up in NYC last week my guess is that they will try to screw everyone else to pay for the NYC drivers.
Everyone else can go futhselves lol. We should get together and talk about taking a day or a week off not an hour or two. That joke in May was truly a joke and flopped big time. What refund? Can you walk backwards? Can you time travel? [deleted]"

I've been surprised to see a scheduled pick up at a 25% surge.  It happens sometimes.

They need to stop this over saturated market and I don’t think I should ever give anyone a ride for under $5. $3 bucks for even a mile makes me so upset. 
I got myself screwed up taking my pay daily because of such a huge loss in income. I have no clue how to fix this or get out of it. 

I am hating Lyft so much right now. I am crying daily because I can’t make enough to pay my expenses and eat. I wish I had never started doing this. I feel like all these other drivers must be making money. 

Lyft needs to change shit and make this more profitable. I am killing Myself and destroying my car. 

I also don’t understand how people who use Lyft think it is ok to not tip. I give excellent service. Clean car. Smells great. Water. Mints. All kinds of stuff. Then stiff me. Almost every damn ride. 
I had a drunken very old man piss in my car. Because I couldn’t get photos of piss I get no help. Wtf. I always get stuck with people who need all kinds of extra help. 

Elderly pick ups from hospitals. That I then spend an extra 15 minutes helping out of my car to their homes. Hospital doesn’t tip.

FYI you are a noob if you think the business model is unsustainable lol. does anybody pay attention ?

this is a pay cut .  there slashing your rate card giving this .

some drivers reporting there  making .45 a mile no time to pick up then  its .45 a mile and .19 a minute .

his rate card was .85 and .15     he no longer drives .

during the day my eta average under 5 minutes how would this help me ?

Check out my amazing earnings with Lyft in Las Vegas!,47,100.05425801516131,Lyft,Image,"Six dollars a ride. Seven dollars an hour. Gross. Ended the day with 92 dollars working over 11 hours. Been online this morning for over two hours with no rides. Finally drove to the airport queue (15 miles on my own dime) where I’ll wait over an hour (98 drivers ahead of me) for a 6 dollar ride. lmfao. 

Lyft is a dogshit company. The biggest advantage of having your own vehicle is being able to multi-app. I would have barely made anything doing Lyft only when I did ride share. There are less trips on Lyft by 3:1 where I was at the time in Atlanta. On the busy Friday and Saturday nights I got Surge trips every weekend, and for 2018 only one PPZ trip on Thanksgiving. I didn't work NYE as I went off to visit family instead of fighting that chaos.

I typically made over twice as much on Uber than Lyft in a week. Full disclosure, I rejected every Lyft trip while I was on a sticky surge during weeked nights, so I could have made more on Lyft but less overall had I accepted those.

Of course I don't know all the details of your circumstance, I'm just asking you to think long and hard about continuing with the Lyft rental. He hasnt made anything yet. Cant cash out until he covers the cost of the car. Hes currently giving his time and gas for free in hopes that later he can get some of it back if he meets the requirements for rental rewards.

My advice give the car back. You made barely 1 dollar an hr that is shameful Way to kick ass and take names! Today I did a ride that was about 41 miles and took me a little over an hour to complete, I got 39 dollars and NO tip :))))))))))) Drive smarter not harder Damn, that's rough ! I really have the strangest feeling you have no idea what you're doing, and have yet to learn how to maximize your earnings. Hang in there - @ 60 bux a day, you should have that rental covered by Friday afternoon. Prob have most of your gas covered by Saturday afternoon but then EVERYTHING you make from then Saturday at noon until 5 am Monday is YOURS TO KEEP.

You don't have toll roads in vegas do you? I always thought vegas was the place to make money. Yes! Toil for your oligarchial overlords. Crushing it, bro! This week has been tough, I think it's 4th of July weekend, people are just lounging around the house all day.  Probably just going to take tomorrow off completely to avoid wasting gas, or just do airport rides and turn my car off during the wait, that's the most fuel efficient way to earn money on Lyft.  

I have a strong suspicion that 4th of July will make up for it these amazingly bad days. I have made dirt this week in SF too Maybe try Postmates as well? It's rough out there. I'm not trying to say this isn't right but don't Uber/Lyft/taxi drivers have an app for kickbacks in Vegas? When I was there back in September, my Lyft driver was raving about it the whole trip lol Nimrod=OP So you started driving around noon on a Tuesday. I know it's vegas but even then that has to be the shittest possible schedule to ride. Try the next 9 hours starting at 6pm and see what happens. Drivin in Vegas fuckin suckkkkkkkkksssss....

The strip is the worst. I hated getting stuck down there. 15 minutes to get a pickup for a 4 dollar ride from rude ass drunk tourists. Dead for me in Houston too. Funny thing is last Monday was my best Monday. This Monday was my worst. It should pickup over the 4th. Holy crap! Not much better here in LA! Sorry it’s really rough out there right now hopefully it gets better but will probably only get worse.

Accident Happened while Off Duty to my Lyft Vehicle,7,100.60744088554273,Lyft,"So see the title, I drive for Lyft(my vehicle) and my car was hit by another driver while I was off-duty.  They were at fault, but now my car needs repairs and I can't drive for ~2weeks, which hurts my income.  I approached the other party's insurance about wage compensation and they replied with: ""because there's no set amount lyft drivers make, we don't cover lost wages for that"".  I have a clear record of weekly income via the app that can be referenced for wage compensation.  Does anyone have experience succeeding with this?  Lyft makes up a fair amount of my income and I really don't want to lose out on this because of someone else's fault.","Maybe you could sue the driver for lost wages, I'm not sure. Of course insurance is going to get out of paying anything. Sorry that happened but hopefully you can get something, good luck! I was in the exact same situation a few years ago when I got rear ended at a stoplight. I filed a claim through the at-fault party's insurance company (USAA in my case) and they approved payment for a month of lost wages based on my pay stubs. I got a check about a week later.

YMMV, I can't promise that every insurance company will be as cooperative. If possible, I'd submit a claim through your own insurance (you DO have rideshare coverage, right?) and let them go after the other party for lost wages. The other drivers insurance is bullshittng you. Threaten to sue for lost wages and provide your last four weeks earning statements."

Dispute a charge,11,101.0354154226046,Lyft,"Hello Reddit,

I just need some advice on this photo here. I was in a lyft ride home with 3 other friends. The ride was a quiet ride, but the driver was one of the worst drivers that I have ever been in a car with. She would drop her speed randomly on roads, was swerving heavily and seemed like she was falling asleep. It seemed like she was trying to smell her breath at one point. She didn't really speak to us when we talked to her and seemed kinda out of it. After consulting with the others in the car we decided we should report her because it seemed as if she was under the influence. Lyft team did a good job following up right away. The next day around 3:10 I was notified that I was being charged 100 dollars for damage done to the car. We were told this was vomit in the car, but I know for sure that none of my guest threw up in the car. The picture that is attached shows what lyft claims happened in the car. I am unsure the best steps to take. The support line for the charge has been unhelpful at best. They have taken a long time to reply to emails and said they opened the case and I will be charged. I have not been kept in the loop on any of this and feel helpless in the matter. Any advice on how to deal with this?

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/pb6ovjkj3q731.jpg","Don't give up. Keep in touch with support and continue to deny it every step of the way. I don't have any personal experience with this but I've read about it again and again. The best thing to do is to be persistent because that will make you stand out. And someone that's lying wouldn't necessarily put in as much effort to dispute it. That driver will eventually be deactivated if it happens multiple times and each person disputes it persistently.

There's hope, friend. See here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/bqmb9w/lyftuber\_vomit\_fraud/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/bqmb9w/lyftuber_vomit_fraud/)

**Contact them on Twitter.** As an aside to /u/31337hacker 's method, it is entirely possible that the driver reported your ride by mistake. Sometimes the Report-a-Ride automatically selects a different ride than the one we were seeking to report. So, asking support to contact the driver to confirm it was your ride and not, say, the next passenger they took could be fruitful. Hopefully you get this resolved in a timely manner. The fact that this driver instantly knew who reported her and retaliated with vomit fraud means there's a lot more to this story. That's the drivers front door. How would you have even thrown up there?"
I'll be periodically be posting my 2015/2016 earnings to show new drivers what we used to make before Lyft screwed us.,64,101.16822792261563,Lyft,Image,"We were the power drivers that made Lyft what it is today. Holy shit. I did lyft for about 2 months while I had the new driver bonus and made like 150-180 for 6hrs then that bonus went away and it just wasn’t worth it.

[https://imgur.com/NDqupoT](https://imgur.com/NDqupoT) So what used to be the minimum fare? As someone who is just in the process of signing up to be a Lyft driver -- what changed?  Is it even worth it now? Yep then they came up with the know your rates before you go or whatever the term was and it was all over. Then people started shopping the apps for the cheapest rates, figured out that they could walk outside of those Prime time squares. Instead of paying fair market prices for the demand or time of hour. The trend became finding the cheapest ride. That trend evolved into multi stops taco mode and the Lyft Shared crap. Just gettting cheaper and cheaper, now rates barely match the expense to drive. It’s a shame what this whole thing could’ve evolved into. Now all parties involved: Lyft and it’s drivers are barely getting by. TIP ALL DRIVERS WITH CASH WHEN YOU CAN! The days of Power Driver Bonus, how I miss thee.

I've had a few of these as a lyft driver that I have to remind people to put their seatbelts on. The way I do it is I say ''Please fasten your seatbelts and we'll be on our way.'' Most if not all obey my request. But I've had a few that ignore me or try and argue with me. At that point, I do remind them it's the law and it's for safety as well. If they argue and refuse some more, I then ask them to either put their seatbelts on or I will have to cancel the ride. I've had one that refused to do so and I ask them to call another lyft and please exit out of the vehicle. I then report them to lyft.

""Hey, buckle up real quick, I'm gonna try something"" Honestly it's a huge liability problem. If you tell them to click it, they give you a low rating for telling them what to do in your own car. If you don't, you're both at risk. It's ridiculous. My state it's not my problem if they are over 18. It's their ticket and life. Your philosophy is probably the right one, but I tend to let anyone over 18 do what they want. If they're in the front seat, the indicator will beep for the duration of the ride and I'll usually use that to strongly suggest they buckle up, but half the time they don't anyway. I can't afford to refuse the rides in my pretty slow market, so I generally just give up at that point. Not a great philosophy, but at least in my state they get the ticket, not the driver. My car makes this annoying beeping sound if you don’t put on your seatbelt. Sooo that seems to work well with those people who don’t want to wear one. They usually do it just to get the noise to stop My car doesn’t move unless they are buckled in. Some people don’t immediately think of it (often people in the back), so I turn and give them “the mom look” until they grab for the belt before I take the parking break off. It actually works. Unfortunately the extreme majority of my passengers do not wear seatbelts and I'm not willing to guarantee a bad ratio from every other ride by telling them to put it on It's an every day problem and it's fucking annoying. Lie to them and say you’ve already been ticketed for unbuckled passengers.

If you have a accident what happens?,7,102.19108671893676,Lyft,"One of my Associates is driving in Maryland for Lyft.  She got into a accident with a passenger in the car and it totaled the car out.  
 She was on Express Drive which is a rental I believe, but less than two weeks later they had put her into another car.  
 I'm only asking because she won't tell me the details and I would like to know how lyft is recovering especially if they put her in another car? She was not given a ticket she says but I don't believe her because there was no other car involved and wouldn't the police give her a reckless drivers ticket?    
Does anyone know what really went down with her, she still driving for them in the rental car, did she have to pay a deductible? they put her in another car but she didn't have $1,000 for the deductible at the time, I'm positive about that because she is behind in her rent from the time she started driving for Lyft  6 months ago.","Her situation, personally, is none of your business.

Lyft’s insurance does have deductibles.  I don’t know how express drive changes that - I’ve never seen the terms of the express drive contract.

A single car accident doesn’t necessarily mean a ticket.  There may not have been a ticketable offense observed, alternatively the department will have its own policy on when tickets are or are not issued - that’ll vary by locality.

Depending on the circumstances she may or may not get personally sued and that could take years to happen, again depending on the state.

How’s the passenger? Ask her directly. If she won't give you answers, mind your own fucking business. If they got her into a new car and she didn’t have money to pay the deductible I am sure they worked something out with her where she’s paying it off from her lyft income."

Insulting man. “bonus +$1.85” gtfo Yep it's become foolish to take a Lyft trip when last I did it in March of it's busy.  For the Superbowl in Atlanta I couldn't find a PPZ but the whole area I was in had a surge of 8-10. I shut off Lyft for the weekend as Uber also had a Boost going. In the heart of Los Angeles at 2am they offered me a $1.50 bonus [deleted] The problem is that they took surge off the front and hid it on the back. You pickup in the pee-spot and don’t find out until *after* the ride if you got a bonus. I like gambling as much as you, but this is my job. I’m not sitting in heavy traffic in the chance I’ll get something. The red is a great indicator to where to go to get the Uber surge. Even when they have ""prime time"" it sucks. They had a $2.50 bonus in my market compared to Uber's $6-7. That plus a worse rate card and the fact that all the worst passengers have started riding with them because coupons. Since their IPO the plane crashed into the damn mountain for them. that just shows overall demand, PT/PPZ shows supply. There may be plenty of drivers servicing this area already. Story of my life lyft really wants to play the game How low can my acceptance rate get Will i am at 12 % now got fed up with there bullshit lies they show primetime and then you get pings from 15-20 min away with no primetime well big fuck right off to lyft cause  I wont pickup anyone anymore Looks like I need to login and get some rides everyone is declining lol Same here in La, I stoped going to busy areas, there is no point. you are correct and incorrect here.  yes lyft took away prime time ......

lyft is still charging higher rates for pax just keeping the prime time for you ! .  

my info is from pax i ask them often . how much is lyft charging you ?"
New Lyft Scam in New Orleans?,6,102.95774181154867,Lyft,"Last night I ordered a Lyft from downtown. Driver showed approaching on the app and then his marker hit where I was. But he nor his car were anywhere in sight. I walked around searching for him and then a different car came up and two girls asked if I needed a ride. I said no and they drove off. I kept calling the 5.0-rated driver like 7 times and he never answered. The girls again pulled up and asked again and I said no. Finally, the app flagged me as a no-show. I appealed and they refunded the $5. Is this common? Is there anyway that driver can be reported? It blows my mind that a scammer can hold a 5.0.","[deleted] Ok. NOLA can be a rideshare beast. If you ordered from the Quarter and put down a pin, not an actual address or business, that pin is likely to be off by 3-4 blocks. This happens to me CONSTANTLY and as you saw, there's nowhere for us to pull over. So if you're not toes on the curb ready, we likely pass you, park about a block up (IF there's parking) and wait. Now, the guy make have just been hiding from you bc once he saw where you were going he decided it would be more lucrative to collect the no show, who knows? But I don't think it was a scam. They might be spoofing their location her is the deal .  lyft changed drivers . somebody was closer then the driver that accepted your ride.

so those girls were you new drivers ."
How safe is Lyft? (Drivers welcome to respond as well),14,103.12689690415506,Lyft,"Hi everyone , I just have a quick question 

I’m away from home on a summer job contract with no vehicle. Up until now , I’ve been carpooling with a coworker , but his car broke down on our way home yesterday so I’m out of a ride for at least the next week . It’s looking like I’ll need to use Lyft to get home, and I’m really nervous because I’ve never done it alone before. I’m a pretty small petite woman, so being in any situation where I feel like I have no control , ESPECIALLY with strangers terrifies me . My job doesn’t allow us to bring weapons (as in mace) onto the premises so I have nothing with me except my keys if something goes wrong. I’ve heard so many instances of people being harmed by their Uber/Lyft driver. I don’t know if they’re isolated , but it’s enough to make me anxious . So how safe is Lyft? Do drivers go through extensive background checks, fingerprinting included? How do I keep myself safe riding alone? I planned on calling a friend and having someone else track my ride just to be on the safe side. Is it safer to sit up front, in the back, or does it not matter? I can usually find a ride TO work with no problem (I don’t mind going in earlier and sitting for an hour) but getting home is the issue because I finish a lot later than my other coworkers , and no one is willing to make a 12 minute drive to come get me (despite me offering gas money). To be fair , it’s not their responsibility and I’m well aware of that, but I’ve expressed my safety concerns to them and no one will budge, leaving me no other choice but to Uber or Lyft . Since I’ll only be living in this city for the summer, I’m not familiar with their taxi service or else I’d call a taxi . I just have some preconceived notions (and valid concerns) about riding alone and I want to keep myself as safe as possible . 

TL;DR: away from home on a summer job contract with no vehicle . Coworkers car broke down so I’ll need to use Lyft to get home and am concerned about my safety .","Ridesharing is almost totally safe. Just make sure you get in the right car with the right driver. And if you don’t feel right for whatever reason, don’t get in or if you are already in ask to be let out while dialing police. That said, how hard would it be to familiarize yourself with the taxis in the area? I’m a driver and before I could drive with Lyft, the company ran a background check on me. They run background checks on every driver just like any other job. The app will tell you the driver’s name, a photo of the driver, his license plate, and the color/make of the vehicle. Just make sure every checks out and you’ll be ok.

What you can also do if you don’t feel comfortable is to share your location with a close friend through your phone.

You don’t have to speak to the driver if you don’t want to. I personally just ask how the passenger is doing and go from there. I don’t mind when a passenger sits quietly. What the others have said: Just make sure that it's the right car. Also, if at any point you feel uncomfortable, find a reason to get out. Report unsafe drivers - they won't match you again. You will be fine. The news likes to hype stories about pax safety but they have all kinds of protection the drivers don’t. I am probably justified in being more worried about a random pax pulling some bs. License plate, type of car, the Lyft emblem is displayed or they have a Lyft app that lights up (these drivers have been around longer) persons knows your name and destination, and you feel safe.
Wait inside where you’ll be able to see the driver pull up. You’ll have 5 minutes of wait time before he cancels and moves on. Lyft is 99% safe, just like the society is, but make sure all those things I listed are correct in the app and match, if not, cancel, order another. If they charge you for canceling, you can call and tell them that the drivers information wasn’t correct and they’ll refund you. 
So I highly recommend not doing a shared ride for the first go. I think many drivers are missing half the point. Background checks don't eliminate the means, motive, and opportunity. And that sexual harassment isn't the same as sexual assault; the former gets people fired but the later put people in jail.

Every driver has to pass a background check. You can assume that only in rare cases convicted violent criminals can get through. You just need to check the driver's name and license plate.

There is a first time for everything, including violent criminals. You are within two feet of a total stranger who may be much stronger. You are alone and you have no control where you are going. You can't easily get away. You can't carry anything but he may have as many tools as he wanted.

Are there opportunities? How long is your trip? How much traffic? Sparsely populated or city center?

The safest way I can think of is by chatting with your mom or boyfriend on video throughout the trip. You can fake it if you cannot make it. At least you can live stream your video or voice so if you cry for help someone like flatmates can hear you.

Some of my lone female riders do talk over the phone throughout; it's their natural talent. Follow Google maps to see where you are and if you are getting there. Even if you are clueless you can tell your phone that ""I'm at 711"" as if you know where you are.

What who give you the idea of sitting in front? It makes no sense. This gives me doubt if you can handle yourself well. 

Obviously, some drivers get a kick out of probing you with personal questions and see how far they can get away with, even if they don't have violent intentions. Politely refusing to respond to personal chat is not rude. Just treat your driver as a human being, not a low life, will not trigger the worst in him. You should not tolerate sexual harassment, even verbal, because that's a sign of weakness. And who knows what next? Anyone can be a murderer. Even doctors. 1) if your not sure that the person there is for you, check plates. If they look right it's also fine to knock on the window and ask for the drivers name. DO NOT GIVE YOUR NAME UNTIL YOUR SURE THE DRIVER IS THERE FOR YOU! 

2) Small talk is fine, if you feel uncomfortable or uneasy about conversation, don't just stay quiet. Let your driver know you prefer not talking or if they are playing music ask them to turn it up a bit. They'll get the hint. 

3) Always set your ride with stops included. Don't ask once your in the car if you can add a stop. Its actually rather annoying as we don't see your destination but we do see how long the ride is and some drivers actually budget their time as they need to get to work or go to the bathroom. We consider it very rude to asking to add stops after we pick you up and we will give you a lower star rating for it. 

4) if you have a pet you wish to bring please let your driver know in ride notes. Don't lie and say your chuaua is a service dog, its blatantly obvious your lying since the minimum height and weight of service dogs. Also you might want a safe ride to your destination, I'm very allergic to dogs and cats. I have very serious sneezing fits around them if they get too close. Last thing you need is me on a freeway/highway sneezing my head off at 60mph because scruffy got curious and close to me. 

5) Please remember your in someone's private vehicle, if you would do or or let someone else do something in your car it's a good bet the driver doesn't want you doing it in theirs. Respect goes both ways. [deleted] Which city? For the most part, you will be fine but just always remember the tips above. Make sure car matches. Plates match. Driver matches their picture. Like others mentioned, it’s perfectly fine to knock on the window, look at the driver and ask if they are there to pick you up (never mention your name, let the driver ask you). You can say something like “hi are you my driver?” And if don’t say your name you can follow up with “ok can you confirm the passenger name?”

Most drivers want you to feel safe and are nice. If you get a bad vibe, don’t get in (you have control here). Sit in the back, you can see the driver better and you have full privacy to text or call 911 without feeling intimidated. Also easier to make tiny conversation without eye contact :)

How late do you work? Is it in a public area? Will there be other people walking around? I also recommend setting the pickup area in a safe area and not hard to get to so the driver can find you. I've noticed (and been told) a lot of women ride shared car exactly for the reason that they can not ever feel completely comfortable alone, in a car, with a male driver but late at night the chances are that traffic is light and you will have the car to yourself.

Do not sit in front. 

Sit in back and sit directly behind the driver. This makes you essentially invisible. 

You do not have to engage in conversation other than to say HI HOWYADOIN? THanks for the quick pickup - you see where I'm going right? (Have them read it back to you) and then you say ""THANKS. EXCUSE ME,  I have some email to catch up on..."" 

&#x200B;

 put in your earbuds and look at your phone.  

&#x200B;

Until you do this, some drivers may chat you up and / or appear to be overfly friendly - this, in and of itself, does not necessarily mean they are zeroing in on your esthetic - some are bored and some are just chatty cathy's but most are hoping to strike up a convo and earn a gratuity - ( as avery general rule, people tip the people they like and felt that they were looked after or taken care of v. being ignored)

Most drivers will gladly cut it out if you simply say 'thanks, listen, I'm beat and if it's ok, I'm not much for chatting, would you excuse me? ima check my mail, catch up on messages, make some calls"" etc and you put your earplugs in and look at your phone.  Most of us just like to drive and not have to worry about entertaining you - but we roll with it depending on the rider. Most of us keep quiet and let you run the ride.

&#x200B;

I've noticed some women riding alone, late at night, getting picked up in the boonies, or in isolated areas are by their very nature the most high anxiety creatures I deal with. 

As such, they tend to be the endless chatterboxes, they just can't help themselves. That's OK, but for your first few rides I might suggest keeping it simple. most drivers that have been around for a minute understand completely when a girl gets in and sits behind them , puts in earbuds and looks at their phone - **it's loud and clear :**  

**LEAVE ME ALONE.**

While some would accuse you of being sexist for cancelling rides from drivers who do not meet your requirements, it's YOUR RIDE and if you want to decline a couple drivers in the hope you get a female, or at least some harmless looking old retired guy with one leg and an oxygen tank, **that's your prerogative.** Period. Full stop. 

If you are willing to wait - lyft will send you as many drivers as they need to until you get one you like. It's annoying as hell as a driver to get a ping, make a u-turn just to see it cancel and then get the next ping and then next and get cancelled on over and over because we're still the closest driver - been there and done that. 

&#x200B;

It's an imperfect system and truth be told, If it's after 10om or midnight in an industrial area, you may not find many females willing to come pick you up in there, but as a customer it's your call."

One disgruntled driver has gotten me suspended from Lyft.,30,103.44058903379573,Lyft,"I ordered a ride accross the Bay bridge

The driver accepted and we waited and he arrived.  After arriving and accepting the ride he told us to get out because he didn't want to go where we wanted.  We were a little mad but did as he said and my friend ordered another Lyft.  I put my phone away (without cancelling as I believed he should cancel since he refused our ride).  Side note why the hell doesn't Lyft show the drivers the ride so they can reject it immediately instead of when they pick us up???

Anyways as we are waiting for our next ride, he loops back around the block and yells at us to cancel the ride.  We yell back to fuck off and that we were going to report him.

I emailed Lyft help right away and let them know and they cancelled the ride for me and assured me I wouldn't get paired with him again.  I told them about what he did and how he was yeling at us and he shouldn't drive.  I got a few canned responses but they basically just told me to go away 

Today I get an email and a phone call that the driver said I was aggressive towards him and they are suspending my account.

Wtf!!! When I report the driver I get canned responses and no follow up but now that the driver reported me in retaliation I get mmy account banned and some trust and safety guy accusing me of being aggressive towards the driver.  

Well guess I'm not using Lyft again.","Well maybe don't yell fuck off? > Side note why the hell doesn't Lyft show the drivers the ride so they can reject it immediately instead of when they pick us up???

They dont want drivers refusing to pick you up. Most people are too afraid of confrontation when they arrive so even if they dont want the trip they'll accept it anyway to avoid an awkward situation. This is how lyft/uber want it.

Additional side note: with lyft you actually CAN see their destination when you're within about 100 feet of picking them up. Doesnt do a whole lotta good since you already invested the time to get there. So this driver must've been a complete newb not to realize he could have just canceled/avoided you entirely, which kinda makes sense since you said he kept driving around ranting for you to cancel as if he didnt know how or was too afraid to do it himself. You must have had a lot of drivers complain about you for Lyft to be so drastic. Lyft doesn't tell us were we are going. It freaking sucks.

Yea if I see bay bridge I cancel. I pop it a block away and just take my hit. 

But there been two instances where I have screwed up. I popped it sooner and I cancelled. The lady was closer than the mark and actually approached my vehicle. I just told her I wasnt trying to go to Oakland and I had already cancelled it on her. I'm sorry. Frustrated sigh and walked back.

Another time it was a couple. Who were at a restaurant. I forgot to check, Then I remembered to see where I was headed. I immediately cancelled. Then I looked back and they was literally taking the step to cross street towards my car. I Just yelled out the window, ""I'm not trying to go to oakland!"" and sped outta there. 

Anywho maybe send a text message for next time, ""hey we crossing the bay bridge is that alright"" of course this needs to be Lyft job but for now, that's all you can really do. Sounds like you deserve it.   Lyft wouldn't suspended you unless you have a pattern of bad behavior. Lyft has no choice but to give the benefit of doubt to the complaint so you just gotta wait for them to accept your denial and reinstate your account. Just make sure you actually fight it because if you dont they'll assume he was telling the truth. i am not buying something . i wonder if the magic dash cam into play with this one You wrote;

"" Anyways as we are waiting for our next ride, he loops back around the  block and yells at us to cancel the ride.  We yell back to fuck off and  that we were going to report him. ""

How were you able to order another ride if your app was open to the ride you and he would not cancel ? Yea if u going across the bay bridge.

Text them. Its a big committment that could result in lost money for drivers. Because we can go back across the other way in an empty car burning gas and shit. Not fun. Don't treat drivers like shit. We have the right to refuse service to anyone. [deleted] It can't be one.... check your passenger rating if Lyft is suspending you..there had to be lots of complaints against you. They rarely do this. Entitled aren't you. Maybe learn that you ain't the main character and respect other people."

Is there a parking rule or guideline for Lyft drivers?,5,103.56925801528824,Lyft,"I live off a fairly busy road in New England that has a speed limit of 50. Where the turn for my road is, there is a widening in the shoulder and a cease in the guard rails for residents of the development to pull over out of the faster traffic to safely pull into the development. I recently nearly hit a Lyft driver because he was parked RIGHT in the middle of that small area, almost blocking the entrance to my development, with no lights or blinkers on to indicate being stopped. Is there anything as a resident I can do besides the words I already exchanged with him telling him it is EXTREMELY unwise to park there and that I almost hit him, and would have hit him if I wasn’t paying attention, or I would have gotten rear ended if the vehicle behind me wasn’t paying attention because I couldn’t move out of the way ?","Lyft/Uber provide absolutely no guides or information to drivers at all. Predatory businesses like these rely upon driver ignorance in order to satisfy their customers. They *want* drivers breaking the law like illegal stops, allowing alcohol to be consumed while driving, overcrowding vehicles, etc, because thats just 1 more fare for them and non of the liability. 

You did all you can by helping out 1 driver in among the sea of others. As a driver I always look for a safe place to stop, but I have noticed many drivers just stop anywhere and worse, PAX like to stand in very unsafe pickup zones or run to the car before a safe spot can be determined. It’s just one of the many hazards of the job.

If pax are exiting left into traffic I always glace in my mirror to check oncoming traffic and warn them, mostly for protection of my door not getting taken out."

I've never had an issue with 5.0's but I think there is some potential to the theory that they are just new accounts which could mean anything. I will decline a 5.0 if it has a fake name though, since I assume that is a total moron who cant even properly fake his account. No. It’s most likely just a shitty request that the driver only makes a few bucks on and is going away from demand No. No, it's not true. The grand majority of drivers dont care. How out of touch do you have to be from realistic human behaviour to ask this question seriously. I only take 5.0 rides. If it's slow I will lower my standards and accept a 4.9. I never take ""NEW"" passengers because I have no interest in being their guinea pig."
"Lyft increases the price of your ride when you have credits. Shown here are two identical rides from two separate phones, one with Lyft credit from Samsung, one without. Lyft credit is a scam",54,103.86364458937611,Lyft,Image,"This is a blatant scam I had a $10 Lyft credit, clearly the fare does not go down by 10 dollars Companies screwing customers and services providers and the government's just looking the other way.

 [https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lyft/current\_employees/current\_employees\_image\_list](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lyft/current_employees/current_employees_image_list) 

what lyft is doing is wrong.   i hope there sued soon Nice catch, that is bullshit Sounds like Kohls, but more blatant. Kohl constantly advertises huge ""sale"" prices, but the original price is simply inflated, making it appear the new price is a good deal.

Theres a market place by me trying to get rid of some packs of fruit of the loom underwear, and the clearance tag show that it's on clearance for 75% off and the new price is 14.98. That means this fruit of the loom underwear was originally priced at $59.99. It can be bought at Walmart for 9.99 regularly priced. Of course they do. They will even say that you're getting a discount, with a straight face. And have a rationale behind that statement for when they need to defend it in court.

Walmart and Target raise their prices in your phone app if your location data tells them that you are near or inside one of their stores. Your power company might be building a consumer profile on you based on all that data that their meter is sending back to them, and in the future they might even sell that data to a consumer research group.

These behaviors all root in how being listed on a stock exchange dictates a business's priorities. It's what you must expect from modern-day public traded companies.

That said. A company offers to hold your money in escrow so that you don't have to link a credit card, and set the hook by telling you you're going to get a discount. You need to look out for yourself. 100% of the time there's an ulterior motive. It's a stupid scam since people will be less likely to use it after their credits, believing that the normal price would be $20 instead of $15 Agreed. FUCK LYFT AND FUCK SAMSUNG PAY False advertising is handled by the FTC. To file a complaint (which you should, so Lyft knows it's not okay), go to https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov and select ""Other,"" then ""Something Else"" and describe what happened. Wow, my dumbass never even thought of this with all of the ""you've got a Lyft credit!"" spam I've been getting lately. I never use Lyft and I haven't bothered using the credits. I'm glad I haven't now. Am I missing something here? That is a genuine question… The one that has credits applied is the one on the right, no? These are on different phones, right?  24hr and 12hr clock.

Rates are different for each customer, entirely possible one phone got a higher price due to increased demand in the area.  Surge pricing aka prime time isn't shown to the customer at all anymore except in a higher price quote.

You'd have to test this a few times to be sure this isn't what is happening and they are actually raising prices for credit applied riders, especially need to test at very low activity times and ideally not somewhere around a mall like your photos show.

By all means: I encourage you to do so (and talk to a lawyer if you find further evidence), but this one photo isn't proof. This happened to me and my friend too. Same place, same time. I have the Smart Savings Plan and she have a discount but still different base price. I just started driving for Lyft and reading this concerns me!! 
My question is, at the end of the ride, I immediately get the screen which asks me to rate the passenger; I usually just give 5 stars but the tip screen (whether I got one or not) doesn’t pop up until after?
I’ve taken a few bartenders and waiters with NO tip, how so I alleviate this? TIA I would expect nothing less from Lyft, especially after the crap I've been getting from them concerning a possible fraudulent ride taken using my account, and all they did was logout  any and all devices on the account. The email had no phone number either, even when fraud was suspected. These jerks need a wake-up call and I'm going to do my part by complaining as high up the ladder as I can get, and I'm never giving them another dime of my money. I'll take a cab before a Lyft now. Uber and Lyft are simply untrustworthy companies. When will people ditch them for good? They are not worthy of the success they have had. They only got there by cheating and buying politicians. Guess what? They're the new yellow cab. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. the real issue is why is Lyft pushing their ""shared rides""?

shared totally fucks over drivers, and drives our pay to below-minimum-wage levels.

first of all, Lyft SHOULD NOT EVEN have shared rides, period.

and if they insist on having this terrible option, then they should bury it way out of sight (not have it as one of the first things a rider sees).

yikes!

Will lyft ever stop fucking us drivers over, and will lyft ever do *anything* to help us?

the lyft executives make millions, but what do they spend all their time doing?

figuring out ways to screw over drivers, and also pushing stupid credit schemes.

hey Lyft, how about you just stick to delivering rides? and paying your drivers fairly as we drive around your customers? What is the price difference in standard ride? In Uber Eats you are offered free delivery if one of neighbors ordered something from the same restaurant. I am wondering if they reduced the price for the second rider because they assumed there’s already a rider with the same start and destination. More like dynamic pricing. Every person is charged differently based upon how much Lyft thinks you are willing to pay for a ride. Another way to look at it. Perhaps lyft wants to make sure you will have a ride whenever you request it. To do that, they'd apply a slight surge to entice drivers. That extra money is either going into Lyft's pocket or is a nice bonusnfor drivers.

Guaranteed rides.

Also, make sure both apps are up to date on both phones. Older versions work funky. I'm willing to bet that each phone is using a different account, and the infrequent rider has the cheap fare. I've come across this situation a few times before with my friends and realized that infrequent riders get discounts, presumably to encourage them to ride more. The credit account isn't getting a jacked up price, it's getting the full fare and the less frequent rider is getting the discounted fare."

Lyft Driver and Pax killed in hit and run crash,3,104.45834366346122,Lyft,Image,Wonder if lyft contributed to the gofundme to help the family with the funeral expenses? insanefrompain ill answer your question what  lyft will do.     NOTHING. if it makes the news they will say were very sorry .
this is how the new system they are gonna put out for everyone soon my city and 5 others right now are the ones using this system,23,104.4795357931019,Lyft,Image,"Just going to mean lower pay in the end. If they paid us for time to pickup and didn’t change occupied rates then maybe it would be something to get excited over, but lyft is just looking for ways to keep lowering driver pay, even if it’s disguised in a change like this. 


It’s disgusting, disrespectful and shameful lyft just continues to exploit their drivers and get away with it. Please tell me that this is the “we value your time. So we raised the time pay and cut the mileage” thing? Not soon enough. that is about 2 dollars less then the  rate card in detroit . i can see them cutting our rates soon .

its time for you to decide if its better to bypass freeways and take all surface streets making the trips take hours longer . just give the pax lyfts # so they can call and bitch . explain to the pax sorry i cant put food on my table if i take the freway from these pay cuts. make a copy of them put them  on the back seats tape them up Anything to make Lyft more money and will try and pretend they're making the drivers money even though it's a huge cut So they will start paying while you have the app on but no passenger? Where can I find more info? I'm only about 3 weeks into driving, but Lyft has been terrible in disseminating info on these kinds of updates, I don't see anything in the app or on the website about this...

&#x200B;

So can I just sit with lyft lux on and get paid while I wait for a ride? What market is this? So they paid for pickup time, thats good. The real question is did they reduce the travel pay to compensate? Or was this your normal pay card all along? For arguments sake, it costs a contractor 100k in labor and materials to remodel a house. Would you rather do 2 jobs at 100k each and gross 200k or would you rather do one for 200k?

Yeah, same fuzzy math here."
Why would anyone think of their rideshare as a trash can?,53,104.58815847828708,Lyft,Image,"Yeah shitty pax getting what they deserve. Wouldn’t it be nice if we had ways of letting other Drivers know about this shit? That's douche next level.  Who does that?  A douchey move would be to leave the trash on the ground in the back.  But this guy puts effort into throwing it to the front.  Way to be a trash person in general I don't see why people do this at night or bar closing.  They take most of the surge now.  Why bother then with dealing with drunks?  Also the best thing to do really when you see a passenger holding a open container is to just drive off and cancel making no contact.  I mean most rides are under $10 now.  Why risk something like this or over that?  Let someone else deal with it.

And of course that driver driving a truck took them.  That driver is probably making negative money after fuel expense and repairs.  They don't care or just aren't smart enough to realize it.

Also if the cup struck you I would have said to call the police and file a report.  It might be considered assault or battery and is what the passenger deserves. People who leave trash in that manner are trash themselves. This is why I don’t drive anymore.  Rude and ignorant people.  Not worth $5 to be treated like a garbage can. Happened to me at the MN Wild Game when I picked up couple of not young and not elderly woman and her husband.  When I arrived at their house, she was sitting in the back and she quietly placed her taco platter that she finished eating but still had lots of taco and crap, on the floor.  I told her ""Pick that up mam, I can see you have a big garbage bin in front of your house"".

Another time a Canadian couple did the same thing, and quietly placed their empty soda cans on the floor even though place I was taking them to clearly had a garbage can outside.  I was once Canadian and I found that place shitty so it didn't surprise me that they would do this.  

Pax disrespect us because they view us lowly as if we are nothing,  I was in the lotto Sub and one of them starting attacking me saying I gamble too much and need help and he even referenced my Uber driving and Lyft driving from my post history.  He said ""You can sleep in your Uber"".  I told him FYI I own a luxury house, not only did I win big on lotto before, but I also made a shit ton off CryptoCurrency.

Society apparently things Uber or Lyft drivers are on a lower level like that of building garbage cleaners, they think we make like $9 or $10/hr as employees and stuff and not as independent contractors. Did you get a cleaning fee? Man, the douche baggery of some people. Better question is why would he engage the rider at all? Toss him on his ass, all other conversation is unneeded and increases the chance of a violent encounter. That's when you report them to lyft and charge them $150 cleaning fee. Section F of the Louisiana law for open containers (LA RS 32:300) says they it doesn’t apply to any paid fare passenger of a common carrier. [deleted]"

What city? Of course your making less money.  They have the advantage.  They are gonna give the ride to the closest driver so big deal they are paying a little to get there.  They are making so much more on the actual trip.  What an obvious congame.  And they'll use beautiful and wonderful language and love music telling you all about the change.

Lyft's monthly subscription is a fucking scam,4,104.73172329311294,Lyft,"I used to lyft regularly from my home to work. It was always 13-14$. After they introduced monthly pass, it's always 15.5 - 16$. If you take 10% of 16$ it's 14$ again. What a scummy business tactic. Basically the same rates except they get 10$ per person joined it. For past week, I've switched to good old uber. Fuck you lyft.","Yeah, Lyft's a scam for both drivers and riders...this is news? I was tempted to get it (Monthly Pass) myself. But didn't - for exactly the same reason. I figured with upfront pricing there is nothing to prevent Lyft from raising my price by the discount amount. Yep, same thing happened to me when I got the Lyft pass. Bullshit ride pass. If you live in the city, it does protect you from surge prices during rush hour, right?"
I just hit gas pedal on dude who was smoking as I pulled up.,40,104.76447792274256,Lyft,App told him i was 1 min away and I got to him in 1 min.  Sorry but what is the logic in lighting a smoke after you request a Lyft around the corner and you can't even finish the smoke so you have to hold the smelly smoke you put out on the ground in your hand and you breathe it out in a drivers car? I swear I hate smokers that do this.,"Even worse.....the ones who give u the just a second finger as they puff that thing down as you sit there.   Ive wanted so bad to cancel on them but havent....im thinking i might next time it happens *They* hire *us* so they have no excuse to pretend like they don't know we are on the way, or that we'll be there in less time than they can smoke and then properly air themselves out. Have some social decency, and don't purposely smell bad in my car. Annoying a f. Had drunk couple come out lastnight from a trashy bar  downtown.  They were out front talking to friends and the guy looked at me several times. I knew he knew I had arrived and was his ride but they were having so much fun with their extended goodbyes. Finally they start headed toward me and he says put the cigarette out and she says wait let me finish it (its maybe 1/4 gone) and I just drove away as they were standing next to my back door. Smokers are some of my best tippers It annoys me as well but I figured there's no point in fighting it. All I do is tell them I'm rolling down the windows because of the smoke smell. They're always fine. I apologize to any pax I get immediately after by telling them the previous person was smoking. The new ones always say it's OK/Don't worry/It's fine. I wish we could indicate - absolutely no smokers!!! When did all of us turn into such cry babies talking about us and the passengers. Seems like everyone is so fucking sensitive about any little thing. Just deal with it and stop complaining the only thing I agree is with the couple who were standing and looking at the driver knowing he’s there and still talking to their friends I would have done the same just leave. But seriously people stop complaining Are you simple So you'll pickup drunks but not smokers..  mighty white of you. [deleted]"
Question RE: Lyft Event Code for Wedding,5,105.08006820053413,Lyft,"*I posted this in a different sub yesterday, but just realized this was probably a better place to ask*

Hello! We are doing a Lyft code for our wedding guests as we are not able to provide shuttle services. (Each code good for $20 off)

Our venue isn't in the *middle of nowhere*, but it's also probably not a hotspot for rideshares. 

**Is there a way to let Lyft know there will be an event in the area?** 

I did ask the venue host if anyone ever had issues getting a Lyft, and she said no. However, She didn't seem too confident or have much info to offer about that type of stuff.","There is probably a local Facebook group for rideshare drivers in your area.  Message the administrator of the group. That's probably your best bet to inform drivers. [deleted] If you have 100 guests requesting a ride after the wedding is over, you may cause a Primetime and have drivers willing to drive in from miles away. You'll also be charged a premium for the rides. A local group may not want to be in the area to keep the primetime/surge down."
Is it a scam email??? Or is this actually a Lyft Promotion that is being run in my area?,4,105.08297329312674,Lyft,"I noticed in my email that I had an email from Lyft (or at least, it looks like it). It states that since I have taken five rides within a certain time frame recently, I can get $20 dollars in taptogo credit for the metro system (Los Angeles area for reference).

I haven't heard of any promo between the two companies until this email, so I'm not sure if it's a real deal. I tried to see if I could send a question to Lyft's customer support, asking about it, but the system wanted me to choose a ride that had the issue, so I couldn't put the question through.

It seems way too good to be true, so I'm leaning towards it being a scam... But I'm not sure.",scam. lyft sends those promo bonuses directly to your account you will see it on the app Did you try emailing Metro?

Lyft / Hertz -- Florida; Palm Beach & Broward,21,105.57220940425992,Lyft,Image,"This is net -  NET - after car rental? so after gas you made 50 bucks? sheesh.

I worked express drive for over a year in Miami. Last year during the summer I was barely covering car/ fuel/ chow - I found that being locked into just one service (and the weaker one at that) is suicide. (here in Miami we get people from all over the world and they know Uber - Lyft is USA and Toronto only - Uber is 75% of my biz)

Every time I went into the hub (mine was pep boys on 163rd) they were churning out a new class of ~~dupes,~~ drivers.

I heard through the grapevine they had a 50% flake rate within the first 2 weeks. after 30 days it was maybe 1 driver out of 6-8 that stuck it out in the summer. People would drive all week and OWE money on their credit card for the car rental. When I left the rates were approx 250 a week and if I got stuck with a vehicle with poor gas mileage (jeep or sportage SUV for example) I was dropping 100 a week on fuel. I was driving just for the sake of driving and to get out of the house because I was making dick.

&#x200B;

Time to put some serious thought into efficiency and how you operate. Where are the best rides going to be any given hour of the day?  Don't drive around aimlessly this time of year, find a spot with action and park - you can literally drive from downtown west palm to downtown miami and not get a single ride - the algorithm will ALWAYS give the ride to someone closer who has been sitting there for 5 or 10 minutes or longer. As a moving car YOU WILL NEVER GET TO THE FRONT OF THE QUE IN THAT AREA IF YOU ARE MOVING AND THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A CAR ALREADY THERE. Every hotel, every mall, etc will have MULTIPLE DRIVERS camping. You pull in , find a shady spot and wait until you come up in the que. After 15 minutes I might move to another spot down the road - especially if I see 3 other cars and none of them are moving either. BUT YOU CANT JUST DRIVE AROUND BURNING GAS.

&#x200B;

The suck is tough sitting in a car for sometimes an hour  - pull into a shopping center and run your errands. walk around the dollar store - whatev, it breaks the monotony. Eat lunch - turn on the app once you are done eating and just read your phone until you get a ping - try and stay out of the car as much as you can - even pulled over and idling you are burning gas.

&#x200B;

Choice spots. The beachfront hotels or any hotel around checkout time or dinnertime , shopping malls anytime, large apartment complexes, colleges, wal marts , grocery stores, big medical office pavilions and office parks. late night you can get rides outside the big nightclub areas

&#x200B;

I use an app called FARE PILOT that tells me where the local hot spots are - I used to get pulled 30 miles out to the boonies and then drive back to the beach empty and rinse/repeat. it's helped me HUGE with efficiency.

&#x200B;

Learn how to use destination mode and use it to stitch 3-4-5 rides back home at the end of the day and stop spending time cruising around empty.

&#x200B;

I've had some folks tells me that the food delivery thing can add some income - door dash, etc.

&#x200B;

FInally, you HAVE to work ALL the commuter rushes and you can't afford to pass on shared rides - in some areas it gets busy as early as 6am and usually by 11am it's over. then you can run chow for a few hours until about 2pm - grab a bite yourself and then work evening rush which may last until 8-9 pm - go home (if you can) get a bite and if you have any energy left - head out for the crowd in town on vacation going out to dinner and evening stuff. late night driving home, pull it over near all the clubs and see if you can score one last ride or two going home along your route home.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps. 35 hours... $159? Isn't this awful? When I returned the rental at 2pm. I was told 10 other drivers returned that day.

Yes, I was stuck with a gas guzzling crossover. ( not full SUV)

I added postmates and Shipt. Which means in total I spent 75 -90 hours working shit gig jobs that week.

I have since returned to a 9 - 5 job.

Im not so stupid to just drive around.

If this is possible to spend 35 hours with the app on and make this little it is a disaster and everyone should know.

The rates to drivers through the rental program recently decreased, the amount of drivers increased ( maybe due to season) This was my last effort to recoup some of the cost I lost. Initially, I set out to do 60 hours. When I reached 35 hours I stopped.

I parked at a popular office plaza in Boca and recieved a few rides to Miami. I parked at Ft Lauderdale airport. I drove in peak times 

I was EXHAUSTED. ( working other gigs too)

THe damn car had no tint. ( Florida needs it) I WAS HOT.

I have a 5 star rating I would like to also add that the 2500 deductible was an added pressure driving around. It was always in the back of my mine when I drove or parked at grocery stores. 

Per time it never would have been a living wage. Or minimum wage.

Waking up early and coming home late was loads of fun too! Well yeah you still pay the full rate even if you don't get any bonuses. Yeah.... you get like half the rate on express drive  Fixing the nails in the tires and blowing out on 95 were also experiences I really didnt need. Miami region is the pits, in general. Dade/Broward/Palm Beach is huge area and saturated. I’m southeast FL too. Usually hang around FTL, but I venture into Miami and West Palm sometimes. 

Lyft sucks. I get about 3:1 to 4:1 rides on Uber over Lyft. Uber is much more popular. 

I average about $18-$25 an hour gross at any time of the day. My best times are when it’s busy on weekends, $25-$30, and can be upwards of $40 on long drives. 

I have learned what neighborhoods are good for long trips to downtown FTL and the airport. I have also learned where to hang out by which hotels to get more rides. I also found an absolute honey hole of a spot that there are literally no drivers at and there is constant rides from. 

I made $134 yesterday in about 6.5 hours, from 7 AM to 2 PM with a lunch break. I made $83 the night before from 8 PM to 11:30 PM. 

There’s money to make. ...if you are not driving a Hertz rental WTF If you're only doing 31 rides in 7 days, it's kinda your fault for making so little. I am in LA, and I make solid 1k to 1.2k each week. I always work enough to pay the minimum weekly, which is $47. It seems like you didn't drive enough."

This goes for vallet too. They get pissed. 

And it is always in a single lane road. So we can impede traffic. 

We dont have any form of immunity to disrespect traffic laws and lyft will never pay a dime to a ticket. 

Stop it.","Please stop asking us in general to pick up at no parking zones. Please stop trying to enter my car with a solo cup filled to the brim. I had a pax yesterday who was waiting for me while leaning on a ""No Stopping Any Time"" sign. Sigh... Stop setting your pin so far away from your actual location and act like I'm stupid for not driving my car through your house and into your actual bedroom to pick you up. And for the Lord of God stop slamming the doors! :D valet can suck a cock, they don't actually own the roads, but pretend they do, when in fact, the majority of Valet curbs in downtown are on public streets.  Just because they put a big sign above the street curb in front of their store, doesn't make it their curb.  Pull right up on their asses, then don't move when they tell you to. Please stop not bathing for days before ordering a ride Please start realizing lyft is the cheaper option of transportation and thus actually tip. The alternative is more expensive. What are you really going to do with that money saved? At least throw a dollar... we dont even get the full amount YOU pay. 50% or more goes to Lyft.

A tip makes all the difference for short rides. I'm easy, just pick a spot where I don't have to impede traffic (that's not a bus stop) and I'm happy. I have never had issues with valet , i pick and drop off in them all the time. Some will even open door for my PAX. Your city must be filled with a holes. Same for the COPS here, as long as I am not blocking traffice, they dont hassle me if I am at  fire hydrant  bus stop. If you didnt make surges happen and then wait till then die.

I actually enjoy going out when its like that and laughing at the saps walking with their phone in hand. Especially when it's raining. Please stop requesting shared rides to only get taken to a bus stop or train station because it's too easy to give you a 3 star rating."

No responses from Lyft?,14,105.90766079315985,Lyft,"Hey guys! I had someone track dog shit through my car on Sunday. I had to take the day off to clean it all up (they got it all over my seats ugh) and I contacted Lyft about getting paid for the damages. So far they have not responded to a single inquiry I have made as to whether or not the cost of the damages would be covered. I specified the ride as well as the time of the ride and incident in the report and included multiple pictures. 

Since Sunday I have sent three emails along the same email chain and they haven't responded to any of them.

They contacted me on Monday via text to let me know that evidently that passenger had left their glasses in my car. I informed Lyft that they had not and asked when I would get a response from them about covering the damages and they simply replied that they would let me know soon. Obviously it's Wednesday so it's been 3 business days since my initial report and 2 business days since my last contact. 

Has anyone else been having issues with Lyft responding all of a sudden? They have always been good to me in the past.

No return trips from airport (Denver),9,106.00004505243014,Lyft,The last two trips I've taken to DIA have resulted in zero pings for rides back from the airport. I've tried asking Lyft what they thought and have yet to get a response. Is there something I'm not doing right with the new implementations that they've made for drivers over there? Is it just bad luck? I've never had this happen before.,"one small piece of advice is to check out DEN airport website to see what time flights come in. That could help, however, sometimes its just a matter of supply and demand. Happened to me a few times. Your window to get a ping after drop off is small, like 30-45 seconds, after that you're out of luck. However you can get a ride auto queued as long as you're on a ride, so I would take my sweet time hitting that drop off button after I pulled up. Helping the pax out,  getting their bags, driving away as slow as possible. Usually I'd get a ping  in time to circle back around and grab it, and if not I'd end the ride as I was merging back onto Pena and head over to the gateway park hotels to wait for another ride in. Dang. Thanks guys - these trips have been mid-morning (10ish) so I wonder if that might have been the issue. Just strange considering any other time I've been out there it hasn't been an issue getting a trip back. Rematches at the airport are NOT guaranteed in any way. Contacting Lyft to ask why you didnt get a ride at the airport is funny. I am sorry but it is."
"hi! So yesterday was my first day doing lyft, in Seattle area. Did 16 rides all around with small trips, and only 4 tipped. is that normal that people don’t tip? oriole depend on the situation? also, any tips where to work in Washington? other than airport? which places are the hot places?",42,106.02812375613385,Lyft,Image,"> is that normal that people don't tip?
  
Yes. I’m sorry. Never ceases to amaze me that new drivers come here looking for trade secrets. Even more amazing is that drivers offer ""hot spots"". All of the markets are driver saturated. Compensation is meager at best. Yet here it is. Someone looking for hot spot advice. SMFH Seattle driver here - Just don't expect tips. It's a nice surprise when you do get one. This goes for all markets, not just Seattle. You’ll find longer and larger fares outside the city of Seattle. When you take shorter rides Lyft takes a bigger cut of the overall profit, about a 40-50% of the fare from my experience. With longer rides that are 10-20 miles it’s more like a 30% cut. Going 3 blocks to complete a trip isn’t profitable. You're lucky you got 4 tips. i drive in the high desert, and in LA on the weekends. i rarely ever see tips. other drivers i know say the same thing. people just doesn’t tip when it comes to rides for some reason. a lot of passengers i’ve had seem to think we get like 90% of what they paid for the ride, which is obviously not true. Yes pretty normal.  Many ppl don't really see rideshare as a service or are just cheap as hell because they are using direct service transportation like it's public transportation.  I think it really just depends on the person and how they grew up.  If it makes you feel any better, between Lyft/Uber the other day, I was 1 for 8.  4.95/Lyft, 4.97/Uber, so... It use to be out of 6 rides you'd make 100 plus. I see fares for under 3 dollars on your log and im so sorry you have to deal with that. 

Best advice I've seen, if it's not surging, it's not busy. Fares under 5 dollars shouldnt happen. Dont be afraid to decline. I would suggest driving during commuter hours. If you start around 5am or 3pm, you'll probably get more hits. Is there a neighborhood near you that's popular with commuters? What’s not normal is 25% tip rate. You’ll have days where you don’t get any tips. Yep gas and maintenance is going to eat your profit on those $3-4 rides... yikes that was a bad streak.

Hope this is just extra but back out gas and then 15% SE (self employment) taxes you will owe on “profit” .... and then you get an idea before federal taxes how much you really make. It's normal. Wow, you had a good tip day for most people! I get fewer, most days. At first it was appalling, until it became my outlook on the service industry and ultimately began to consider just reciprocating in my own patronage, in contrast to my prior 40 years of nearly always tipping 20%. Yeah most rideshare folks just don’t tip ... its the fault of Uber when this whole thing started.
Don’t let it change you, I always tip well period, and you will get some generous folks and it makes em stand out. My last generous guy was a bartender, we hit it off had good convo he threw me $25.

It's a pretty big job that's going to take most of the day (5-6 hours) so I figured I'd just take a Lyft to and from Starbucks (because it's closer/cheaper than going all the way home).   


Even though I don't regularly use Lyft, I figured that buying a Lyft Pass would pay for itself in the two rides I was planning on taking (less than 3 miles; about $3-4 WITH the pass). Unfortunately, Lyft is demanding I add a second card to my account which I don't have.   


No big deal. I go ahead and purchase a gift card for my account. That payment goes through without a problem.  


Then the problems begin.  


1. My $10 credit appears in the app and ""no restrictions"" is listed underneath. Yet, the $4 discount on my rides from my ride pass doesn't show when I go to reserve a ride. I purchased a GIFT CARD. If I went into Bed Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon, they would discount my purchase and let me pay with the gift card. 
2. I am still unable to get a ride because a $10 giftcard is not enough to cover a $7 ride (that should be $3). 
3. I have tried putting my debit card in manually and going via Google and PayPal. I thought PayPal almost worked, but Lyft tried charging the card on file $15 for a ride that was listed as ""FREE"" under my fare estimator. I don't have that $15 in my bank account because I've already paid it to Lyft. I have a bank deposit pending, but those funds will not be available until tomorrow.

I'm not sure what to do at this point. Lyft has taken my money but I cannot actually use their services and now I'm stranded.",[deleted]
YSK: reasons for Tipping cash,3,106.05234829318192,Lyft,"So short sweet and to the point. This goes for any food delivery (DoorDash, postmates) as well as ride sharing. 

Please tip cash for a few reasons

A: They get the money. Postmates, Uber (Eats and ride share) and Lyft have been caught stealing several times.

B: They get the money FASTER. All services have a fast pay option but it costs, so tipping in cash lets them get lunch or gas without having to cash out as often. Also Postmates can take up to 24 hours to give the driver your tip and Uber takes up to five.

C: In case of DoorDash, tips go further. Dashers get a gaurentee for delivery. If your tip plus base pay isnt high enough, DoorDash gives them more. If you tip cash, they get both. So your tip goes further. 

D: Taxes. Cash tips are between the driver and God. And God takes less than Uncle Sam.

So basically in app tips can be stolen, take longer and not go as far to helping your driver stay on the road and that means your food takes longer/less chance your uber or lyft has a free water bottle for ya.

Edit: A LOT of you are stuck on the taxes issue. Point D was a joke. Most drivers dont pay taxes once they do their deductions. So if youre sitting there thinking me trying to stiff Uncle Sam is a valid point for you to ignore this, undertstand that me and him are good. I took him all my stuff and at first he was like ""you owe me money man,"" and I was like, ""Check these deductions"" and he was like ""Aw shit, son, we square.""

Also edit becuase some formatting issues.

Edit 2: Thanks for the plat anon

Edit 3: And gold too",Im usually getting between $10 and $20 in cash every week. It’s refreshing and welcome! Cash makes a huge difference. But then you get rated 5.0 and drivers don’t pick you up because you must be bad. Logic. That’s what happened to me and I had to wait five minutes for someone to even accept tonight. Lol.
"As a lyft rider, how can I make the driver's experience better during the actual ride?",23,106.06701264503378,Lyft,,"Make sure your pick-up location in the app is where you want to be picked up.  


Make sure you are at that location.  


Don't talk about tipping. Either do it, or don't.  


Talk if you want to talk, don't if you don't.  


Make any requests that you have verbally. No one can read minds. If you want windows up/down, heat/AC off/on, radio/music etc. [deleted] Do not do shared rides Don’t sit directly behind the driver Don't be stinky. Don't make a mess. Don't ask for a random detour in the ride so you can buy weed. Sitting there like a dummy all the way will do just fine. Taking a fragrance-free bath before will be universally accepted.

What is more important is the before and after. Uber gave riders the illusion that we can find you with pinpoint accuracy no matter where you are. GPS is complicated and far from that.

Make sure you have wifi at home and opt-in to Google location so we can pick you up right in front of your door for a single-family house even without looking at the house number at night. It will work inside an apartment complex with street names and numbers, though getting into gates are major hassles. Also, Google couldn't tell which gate is the entrance or the exit when they are separate.

For anything else, you need to stand under a big sign with safe legal parking. You always enter a name, Starbuck, Apartment complex, Hotel and let Uber fill in the address for you. Failing that, check with Google Maps to see if the pickup point is what you wanted. Always text the driver with helpful pickup location information.

As good as cash, you should be ready for the tip button before you leave the car, so the driver gets a notification before he even drives away. Don't be late for pick up and try to be mindful about the pick up location !! Try not to be awkward. I hate awkward rides, I'm always counting down the miles.

Also tip. Never, ever slam doors. Gentle and steady does the job. This is not the 60's.

&#x200B;

and all of the other hints mentioned.

&#x200B;

P S avoid allowing someone else to ride on your account. 3rd party rides are fraught with complex issues. \-Be ready at your pin. Kudos if pin is an actual pickup spot and not on a downtown street with nowhere to actually pull over. 

\-Don't be an ass. 

\-BJs are always welcomed, but a tip would suffice. Get naked in the backseat, if you're a cute blonde"
How do I proceed?,8,106.09174644134112,Lyft,"Lost my phone in a lyft. Google Timeline and tracker showed me a passenger has my phone, I know their location and where they live.

let law enforcement handle the situation.  second option go to the home tap on the door . tell the home owners you want your phone back . if they say f off tell them your going to follow though with law enforcement and you will demand charges for theft. You're a passenger, left your phone in a driver's car, but another passenger has your phone? How do you know it's a passenger and not the driver that has it?"
Does she know about Lyft scooters?,29,106.11417699689666,Lyft,Image,"Out of 1,300 rides I almost had 1 entitled passenger that called me before I got there. She had a list of outrageous demands that must be met before I picked her up. I said ""ok"" hung up and canceled it. Redneck lol jesus fuck that lady. The guy in the video is pretty well spoken and the car is nice. Had a stacked ride on Uber and this guy calls wanting to know where I'm at and how long is it going to be until I get to him.

I'm nice and cordial and explain that he is a stacked ride and I'll be there ASAP once I drop off my current passenger and that Uber has determined that I will be able to get to him quicker than another driver.

Apparently, he was tracking me since after I dropped off my first pax I was on a one way street heading away from him looking for a path to turn around when he calls again to let me know that I'm heading away from his pick up point and why the hell am I doing that too him.

I nicely try to explain that I'm on my way to pick him up but he is mad that I'm taking too long and says that I want to cancel this ride but that I have to cancel it so he doesn't get charged. I tell him no, he will have to do it.

At this point I was never going to pick him up but decided to aggravate him more since he was rude and unreasonable as all hell.

Anyways, I keep heading away from him off to go to a dinner spot while he is standing there waiting for me to cancel as he watches me moving even farther away.

After another five minutes he calls again and at this point is yelling and cursing at me while I just tell him that I'm sorry it's taking so long and that I'm still on my way!

He proceeded to call me again two more times and I let those both go to voice mail where he went on screaming and having a tantrum about how I was stealing from him and I was going to get a one star from him and kicked off the platform as his family are big shots at Uber, blah, blah, blah.

That was a good one... Wow. Good for you!  I've never had anyone complain about walking to my car before. You handled that very politely. I would've cancelled it as soon as she said ""does this look like a door?"" That would be the end of her ride right there. Knowing that her rudeness would cost her a few minutes would be well worth it. Cutting her off and telling her ""you can hop out"" made me hard btw. Thank you. I once picked up someone at an address. I parked on the street at the house next door. She stood on the sidewalk losing her shit until I put the car in reverse and backed up 10 feet so my back door was beside her. Where did I take her? To the check cashing place literally around the corner, then back (round trip ride). Before you suggest that she couldn't walk or something, no, it was just a hot day. Thank you, I love watching the entitled ones get theirs. How did he get paid if he canceled? Its cause of these bitchs I stopped driving for uber and lyft , everything was proportional on that lady her attitude and her fat ass but had peanut size brain lmao That lady is so insufferable. Here’s the thing...is she a rude bitch? Yes. Is she in the wrong? Absolutely.

BUT I’m sorry, his response escalated the situation.

“I was over there I had to walk all the way over here.”

He says, “Is there a way I should know that?”

Wasted opportunity.

Instead, say “Oh shoot I’m so sorry, yeah sometimes the pin gets screwed up. The developers really need to work on this app, ya know!”

Sympathize with the passenger. Talk about how bad the app is and blame it on the company Lyft. That way you separate her frustration from the INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR DRIVER who has no control over Lyft the company.

I can almost guarantee it would diffuse the situation.

Most of the videos I see on here (most, not all), the driver could have done something to de-escalate the situation. I’ve dealt with every type of these passengers, and almost every situation I see in a video I’ve encountered.

Perhaps it’s because I know how to “play my audience,” but I get the bad ones on my side 99% of the time. It’s not because I’m a “likeable person”....it’s because I adapt to the passenger. All I can think of as she starts talking is, what's the best way for me to get the f out of here Nope. Fuck that shit."
Hey r/Lyft I want to travel the USA while I work!,10,106.19542699691047,Lyft,"I’m currently based in South Carolina and I’ve decided I want to pack up for a couple months and see the country, I drive for lyft full time and I was wondering if I would be able to accept rides in other cities/states? I would spend 5 days or so in each city doing lyft to support myself and then move onto my next city for a few days. So is this possible to do or is the process of applying to different regions too lengthy? Anyone who could provide some feedback, I would greatly appreciate it!","I think if you get accepted in the tougher to qualify states and have a vehicle inspection you would be open to all states with less standard. Don’t ask me who is toughest. I live in Iowa but South Dakota and Nebraska are minutes away. I can no longer accept rides in Nebraska because they changed their rules. I seem to be able to drive in Minnesota until I get to the twin cities. 
TL:DR is it’s probably more complicated than it’s worth. I'm from South Carolina and currently driving in North Carolina temporarily. I had to switch things to drive in NC because I didnt have a particular document on file as an SC driver and while yes some states you can drive in easily like from Ohio to SC in your case. Some have more strict legislations and requirements that would require you to update information and region to be able to add required documents for the new locations. The process for doing so is simple I did my switch to NC in all of 5min over the phone with Lyft support while some states may require a day or more of wait time if you have to have certain inspections or acquire certain forms etc. From what I hear though NY is the strictest state as far as requirements go so if you have all of that stuff you would probably be good for most of the country. I'm pretty sure you'd have to change your residence and driver's license every time you wanted to drive in another state. It's doable but might not be feasible."
Working for lyft and Uber,3,106.49838995987342,Lyft,I just started working for Lyft a few weeks ago and I have heard about people who do both lyft and Uber at the same time.

Sometimes you may need a vehicle inspection done by Uber in which case you go to the nearest hub. I waited about two weeks after applying and I was good to go. Business license?

Best phone mount that holds up?,46,106.88447792285847,Lyft,"What brand/style do you guys think is the best?

Edit: No vent mount and something that can be removed without leaving residue and/or does permanent damage. I want to be able to use with multiple vehicles.","My fav is a vent mount with magnets. Just get a cheap vent clip. Depends what kind of car you're in and the dash/console layout. I've used 4 different cars to do this gig and I've had to rethink the mount each time. But I personally don't like vent mounts or windshield mounts because I like my phone to be EXACTLY where my right hand naturally rests as I'm driving. It's more personal to me and you get less of passengers looking at your phone.

So I usually use a bendable, aluminum gooseneck mount that is meant for the windshield, with the suction cup, but I attach it to my dash. Usually this means it won't suction, so I drill a couple of small holes and screw it into an open spot on the dash.

This allows me to place and adjust my phone to exactly where I want it. And if I ever sell the car, I will just take some paintable glue or like nail hole wall puddy, fill in the drill holes and get some hobby paint that matches the dash.

This is the most recent one I'm using although it didn't need to be this long.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07DD68VWS?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title I got this CD mount one. It is by far the best one I've had.

Mpow 051 Car Phone Mount, CD Slot... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC29ETE?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share Check out ProClips. They sell phone mounts that are designed to fit seamlessly into your car without leaving residue or damage. You go to the website and select your make and model vehicle and they'll suggest a good mount for your car. I know you want something that will be good in multiple vehicles, but moving the mounts around can affect the structural integrity of them. You can get one single phone holder and just move it from car to car as needed (while keeping the main mounting base in place).  


Plus, depending on where you live, windshield mounts and/or dashboard mounts may be illegal. ProClips are designed to mount your phone in a spot where it's visible, but not directly in your line of sight. The last thing you want is to get pulled over for something as simple as a taillight that just died only to get ticketed for distracted driving because your phone is ""obstructing your view.""  You're probably not going to be pulled over for having a phone mount in the wrong place, but it may end up leading to, at best, somewhat of a pass (ie: A ticket for the phone mount instead of being ticketed for a more serious offense like speeding- which happened to me once at a speed trap where the speed limit dropped from 40 to 25; I was given a ticket for a small air freshener I had hanging from my mirror instead) or at worse, being ticketed when you were going to be let off the hook. (""I was going to let you off with a warning, but this is a second violation so now I'm going to have to ticket you.)   


I am definitely planning on getting a new mount for my car soon.

It’s cheap($6) and very decent built quality. Works fine no issues. It holds very tight and unlike some mounts with an arm that sticks and shake constantly. This stays stable solid. Arkon. I’ve had many people ask me what brand mine is. They have their own website and sell on amazon. 
Amy kind of mounting configuration you can think of. My favorite is windshield suction cup with a long telescoping arm. Head swivels for the perfect viewing angle. Not beam electronics.  Ive been driving since September and technically it's help up,  but the left side broke early on and it's been a pain in the ass I like the Bracketron Uber version. It comes with suction cup and vent mounts. If you're an Uber  driver too they likely sent you a coupon code for 60% off too. How about the cup holder ones? I use the Magic Mount by Schosche. Absolutely love it. You can get it at Walmart. They come in two models. One for the vent and one has a sticky bottom you stick anywhere in your car. I have both, but like using the one that sticks on the bottom.

I have one like [this in my car](https://i.imgur.com/aChbW0V.jpg)
It has 2 USB ports and a magnet to hold my phone. I also use the vent clip once in a while, but I prefer this. I got a $4 one that clips into my air vent. A bonus is that it cools my phone when I'm trying to charge it in 95° weather. If you like to keep your phone off the windshield (visibility or heat reasons) and you dont like vent clips then you will have to use the adhesive kind. They wont ruin your dash, just use dental floss to saw off the adhesive mount when you're ready to remove it and spend a little time picking the rest of the goo off with your fingers and finish with some alcohol wipes to clear any residue. Just dont try to rip it off with your bare hands otherwise you could definitely crack the dash. My go-to is definitely a vent mount with the magnet. Easily removable but holds up super strong, doesn’t leave behind anything and you can get one at family dollar for only 5 bucks!! Super easy and convenient Ram mount x-grip

I've had mine for 3 years in the Arizona heat and it still works. Solid construction, no little cheapo molded plastic pieces to break. You’re right, maybe it’s just that scent lol.

How is Lyft compared to Uber in terms of app bugs/issues?,17,107.047406163613,Lyft,"I recently had a very negative experience with Uber in terms of their app lagging/bugs and there is no intuitive way for me to report tech issues or even talk about it with someone, making the whole experience all the more stressful in terms of getting it resolved since the bugs messed up the payment as well.
I googled about uber app glitches and it seems common.

Is Lyft any better in terms of these? Does Lyft app get buggy/laggy at times as well? Do you guys have ways of reporting tech issues and talking with a real person to get it resolved?","I've had way more issues with Lyft app than Uber app.  Granted I use Lyft way more, but I've encountered many issues with Lyft, including far too easy/quick OOM issues/redraws, (that don't happen with Uber) multiple map types showing up when logging out and then back in quickly, multiple times my PPZ bonus has just disappeared, never to be seen again and Lyft support basically says go finger yourself, multiple times I have been en route to a pX pickup, and then (I'm assuming) the pax cancels, but no cancel message is given, no fee given, and no record of the ride or the cancel even exists on my end.  Whether Lyft can find it will be a crap shoot. 

Yeah, tons of bugs on the Lyft app.

EDIT:  FYI, I'm no shill - I use the app 5x a week, 13 hours a day.  If other people say they've had No issues whatsoever and they run full time, I would take their responses with a grain of salt, or perhaps they run part time.  My buddy has had multiple issues with Uber's app, but he uses it far, far more than I do. 

I have a pixel 2xl, but have recreated the issues on an LG V20.  I've verified others locally have similar issues on galaxy s8, s9, and a couple others I can't recall. I’ve never had an issue with either app. What kind of phone do you have?

Edit: actually both apps get confused when i travel abroad and don’t have local data service. I can request a ride when i’m on wifi but lose the signal when i’m riding. Honestly, as a driver, I prefer lyft's app, 10 times out of 10 compared to Uber's. Lyft's design language is heavily influenced by Google's material design language, which makes the app much more intuitive and easy to use, I also rarely get to see bugs or errors with Lyft, which is something I can not say at all about Uber. uber is hands down a better app. it crashed 1 time out of 1600 rides .  lyft always loses connection .  twice a day . garbage .  i have 3 different services plans connected to uber and lyft trust me its not on my side . i hate losing internet . i trade futures need it at all times . Uber is terrible app wise.
I rarely have an issue with lyft Yah, I've never really had an issue with Lyft after two years of use, set updates to do so automatically and there shouldn't be any problem.  The only ""issue"" I ever have is a bogged down cell network but that isn't Lyft's fault. Lyft is pretty bad in terms of payment bugs and issues. I stopped using the app when it started forcing me to have 2 credit cards on file instead of 1. you should be driving for both anyways. On Lyft there have been times where the app will freeze at the drop off location making it difficult for the driver to finish the ride. It has happened to drivers twice in my Seattle market since January of 2019. Both times the riders were overcharged, and later reimbursed. It shouldn’t be a problem for you, but it’s been known to happen. This is all based on my experience of course.... 


Lyft - much better designed app, better in-app mapping and pickup system. 

Uber - still looks like a 9 year old colorblind kid designed it.



Uber - rock solid, few if any bugs encountered.  I've NEVER had an OOM (out of memory) condition and redraw with Uber.   Rides start and finish promptly, and I've never seen a network issue with the Uber app that wasn't plainly caused by the cell network I was on. 

Lyft - buggy POS marring a much better designed app.  App goes OOM on a whim, causing redraws and causing you to miss pings if you don't realize it's like that.  Recently, a nice little bug where if an OOM condition occurs, the setting for the little driver shortcut gets reset and you'll have to set it again if you want that button.  FREQUENTLY, like at least twice a month, there are Lyft-side network issues that persist for sometimes days at a time (like this week!  2 full days of limited connectivity, causing some to not get pings, and causing slow downs for payments, starting and ending rides, etc for everyone else).  I have encountered TONS of bugs where a Pax cancel after 2 minutes doesn't give me my cancel fee AND the cancel doesn't even show in my ride list, so I can't even reference it when calling support.  I've also encountered, multiple times, another bug where when I'm holding a PPZ bonus (once jupiter and saturn align to the winter solstice and make a few appear) it will just disappear while I'm driving for no reason - and again, not something Lyft support can or will help you with.  Also had a bug where a Pax cancel caused my bonus to vanish and then the cancel doesn't show in my list.  Basically anytime a bug COSTS ME MONEY, there won't be a record of the ride or some other similar scenario so that it makes it hard if not impossible to get what's owed, as Lyft support acts like they can't see anything, EVER, unless/until a ride has been requested and accepted - which is BS. 


There are others I'm forgetting.   Lyft is INFINITELY more buggy than Uber, but it's by far the better designed app.  I wouldn't pay much attention to people saying they've never had an issue with the Lyft app...  If they work at any decent clip at all, they will have hit bugs of SOME kind unless they are in a dead market where it's just not busy enough to cause some of these bugs due to congestion (or lack thereof).

I've used the following phones with Lyft and they all experienced the same bugs, to varying degrees of frequency:

Pixel 2xl
LG V20

My buddy uses a Pixel 1xl and has encountered same issues."
Question about my Lyft application,5,107.12976727473516,Lyft,"I recently applied for Lyft and have a question on if my driving record has been accepted. When I go to check my application status, my driver's license and DMV check both say accepted. The background check still says in in review. Does this mean my driving record was accepted? Or is my driving record included in the background check? I am only concerned about my driving record being accepted as I have no criminal background. Thank you for your help.","you should be good to go . depending on your state that background check could take 7 days  but usually less then 24 hours. I assumed they were separate and both of mine came back same day, within a few hours, so I'd say the odds are good you'll be driving in a day or two, as long as you submit all the other required documents today. Mine took almost four weeks to go through... Why not try Uber? They have been paying better .Just curious."
Rental reimbursement?,8,107.23903810806847,Lyft,Good morning I'm wondering what are the cost to rent a car from lift and how do you get reimbursed? I heard you can make a $1000 a week but you have to drive 55 or 60 hours with their rental car . Is there a Chart with all the Figures? Thank so much,"Don’t do it. Period. The rental car itself is about $1,000/mo* or you could buy a brand new car for about $250/mo. It's kind of sad when flipping burgers is better than ride sharing but he's right. 

The best way to describe this rental program is indentured servitude. Forcing drivers to get unrealistic goals in hopes for money. It causes the market to be over saturated, which is good for lyft since they can boast fast pick up times and low fares for pax, but for drivers... it hardly surges and if it does it's only for a few minutes. 


IF IT'S NOT SURGING, IT'S NOT BUSY. Stop being lemmings. Wake up. Get a job that will be beneficial.

Edit: i just did a base fare ride just to test numbers out. One ride was 10 minutes in length (from time i was pinged to drop off so like 8 minutes with them in my car.

Ride totals! I made 3 dollars. The pax paid 7.31. Lyft takes out 4.31. What is the percent lyft takes? Its more than half, i know that much.

I feel you might get 3 in an hour and at base fare its not fucking worth it. Food delivery, although it does suck, it sucks less than lyft. bad decision 1 ..... signing up to drive Lyft

bad decision 2 ..... renting express vehicle. The cost and bonuses vary by market. It's funny how people don't realize 60 hours is a Full time plus a part time job.  I always remembered people complaining they were working 60 hours a week in the distant pass.  Christ if your working 70 plus hours that's 2 full time fricking jobs.  Add the pay for these 2 jobs and your making more than Uber and Lyft.  Because the liability and expense can be a infinite number.  You never know what kinda repair damage, ending depreciation on your car.  Accident, injury, potential lawsuit, a whole host of shit your responsible for that could not conceivably happen with any normal career or job. what flying was trying to say the rental car will cost  you 235 a week !  you will not make 1000 a week .  even if you owned your own car will say in 70 hours you made 1000. minus fuel . will say 225 in fuel an average  city dives  11 an hour profit . now will say you did not get that 200 rides from lyft so the rental car is not free.  most people never get 200 rides in a week far from that . its impossible in my market .

so profit is 540 in 70 hours or  7.70 an hour  with the rental . better to work fast food you will make 12 to 14 an hour here plus benefits"
Help,5,107.79310060806849,Lyft,"So I took a lyft and the starting price was about 75$ but when my ride dropped me off I didn’t get the receipt in my email so I brushed it off as the system being slow but then an hour later I get an email with the details on my ride, it was about $60 extra dollars more and the ride had a longer time and distance than it was in my ride, I think this is the driver didn’t end the ride until an hour after I got out of the car . Is this a good assumption? What should I do? Is there anyone that can help?","Message Lyft. The email has a map that traces the GOD route the driver took. Is the end point near your destination? Or further away? Could also be that there was a prime time fee added to your fare.

If the charge is incorrect though, you can email lyft support and let them know what the actual drop off address is and they'll adjust the fare.

Price Fixing - Bad for passengers and drivers,3,107.99617931178324,Lyft,Noticed different pricing compared between accounts ($15 & $18). How does a company model their costs based on varying each individual ride. Shouldn't Lyft be paying the same fare for both user and drivers?,"It's been happening. Welcome to the world of algorithms. It’s based on traffic data it gets from Google or some other source. Your rates will be always be lower outside of rush hours Drivers get paid based on rate cards, per mile and per minute. It’s pretty consistent and pretty shitty with low rates only going lower.


Pax pay based on demand which varies one minute to the next. It’s probably still cheaper than a taxi and better than taking a bus at a low fixed fare."
"First night trying out placing a Tablet in back headrest area for pax to use.

I tried this with a crappy tablet. No big difference tip wise for me. But then again it was a crappy, small tablet that T-Mobile offered with no down payment.

I did have one moment where a group of girls were in the backseat eating pizza and watching finding dory on Netflix while their friend in the passenger seat complained about her fuck buddy she liked being on vacation with his boring girlfriend 😂 The large majority of passengers I pick up have a phone. They use it. In case you are wondering if they can steal it, an alarm goes off if they unplug the charger from it, and I have placed a sticker that tells people if it is unplugged alarm goes off.  It is really loud police alarm too.  Plus they can't shut it off, it is in lockdown mode via Kiosk admin application for Android.  They can only access Youtube, Spotify and Chrome surfing internet or reading news.  I got it as an idea to keep their mind of off me so they don't hurt my ratings, some pax love to use little things against me and flag me.  Example someone else does something crazy in the road and I avoid them and didn't actually hit them,  Pax still does safety flag and 1 stars me lol.  Pax using things out of my control against me are why I actually got it, so they can look at it and not focus on me lol.

Lyft is coming down HARD on both Black and Lux. They are changing the years and models. Most of their current “fleet” will no longer be eligible starting this fall. I pity the poor fools who buy new cars at this point.,52,108.05815847845817,Lyft,Image,"Wow the 3 series is gone!  I can understand the old cramped ones but the new 3 series are decently sized cars with plenty of 'lux' to go around Who the fuck is driving for Lyft while also driving around in a Rolls-Royce or Maserati?

I believe the oldest model year is 2014. This takes effect in September I’m told. No grandfathering. 

Note the list excludes the hyped up Tesla model 3 which maxes out at $60,000. So much for being green! 

Lyft on bros!

PS- my own ride is now ineligible. I’m so done with this shit company. I’ll be patiently waiting for them to implode. Time is not on their side. 

This company has no self-awareness saying making drivers employees  in CA will bankrupt then and begging for forgiveness and then pull this. Even Uber isn’t doing this. This is ingenious on Lyft's part.

Now Lux drivers whose vehicles no longer qualify can still drive them for base rate standard Lyft fares.

Pax get to ride in upgraded formerly Lux vehicle for base Lyft rates.

Win for everyone except the drivers as usual... Glad my phantom still qualifies!!! But muh muh Buick Enclave cheat code!!

Crafty basturds! lmao I love how is the C class Mercedes and 3 series bmws are gone hahahahaha, Yeah let me use my 50-60k car to drive around people for 10-20 bucks an hour and put 2-5k miles a month on it! Sound like a great idea! Good thing I traded in my Tahoe for a plug in hybrid last week lol. They’re also dropping the rates and removing the multiplier for PPZ in my market. was nice while it lasted! I love how they just say Tahoe and Suburban but on the Fords they have specific trim levels. Time to hit some government auction sites for retired fleet Tahoes! Looks like a lot of livery drivers only and not many personal drivers. With the large Lincoln list it favors chauffeurs and limo drivers. Lincoln Town Car? They quit making those in 8/2011. Damn, I guess my GLA no longer qualifies. 
Or is this for newer applicants because I got a $40 Lux ride two days ago.

Dc market Im a driver in maine. I have a 2015 Volkswagen jetta. Not xl so im assuming ""black"" or ""lux""

Am i going to be ineligible now? Just another reason to hate lyft. If this is true,  i feel they are just trying to hit reset in terms of drivers so they acquire a new fleet of fresh faces willing to do everything they ask.

I can't wait till ridesharing dies. Whatever they can do to make more profits for shareholders, they will do.    
The easiest thing they can do is to pay drivers less and make them work more to keep themselves afloat. 

It's the ONLY thing you should expect from now on. So they can use a Cadillac CTS-V, but not a normal, more commuter friendly CTS? Nevermind the interior is the same GM plastic shit all around some leather seats and fake wood, you can only drive the one that rips shit down the road with 500+ HP if you wanna drive LUX. Makes perfect sense. Lmfao the Acura RLX? How the fuck is a 50,000$ TLX not on the list. Are they fucking stupid? Anyone who actually buys a new luxury car strictly for Uber and Lyft is not very smart to begin with. It’s one thing if you already own one of these cars like I do and drive here and there once twice a week but to go out and buy a 50+k car is just an idiot I'll have some of what they're smoking! Surprised there is no S4. Thry are a nice car to ride in. I got my Infiniti Q40 at the end of March, now effective in January, it no longer qualifies for LUX.  Uber still has it on SELECT.  PPZ are a joke.  At DFW airport last night, Uber surge was $10, LYFT had a $1.76 ride bonus.  What a damn joke.  Looks like I'll be doing Uber exclusive in January.  Thankfully I don't do this full time, I'd go bonkers You got to be a retard to drive for lyft if you using any of these cars  actually if you use anything but hybrid , you are straight a dummy I bet those special Lyft branded SUVs they were trying to get people to buy a few years ago no longer qualify. I feel bad for any of the suckers who bought those things. They've removed my car, but at least I still get regular Lux. No one wants a low end luxury, compact sedan when ordering a Black car anyways. This is old news.  Not all info posted is correct regarding eligibility."

Edit: sorry if this is a dumb question!","Usually, but idk enough about Alaska to be positive Heh, I was able to setup a trip in Anchorage and see vehicles on the map. I'd call and ask the hotel or ask in the city's subreddit. You can check on this next upcoming morning to see what the landscape looks like. Just set your pickup at the airport, even though you're not there.

Got a referral as a rider from a friend which states $50 in credits in 5 rides ($10 off per ride). Does the credit apply once I pay for a regular ride?,11,108.6585635710756,Lyft,,"I don't see the credits, am I suppose to pay full price on the first ride and then I get the discounts? I’ve never heard of such a discount, but on the regular ones, it starts on the first ride Check in the promos section of your app to see if the info is there. Alternatively, start booking a ride and see if it indicates a discount in the price. Usually how it works is *up to* $10 off per ride, so if you take a $7 ride you won’t get charged, or if you take a $12 ride you’d get charged $2. The app should show you the usual price with a line through it and then the discounted price you’re paying."

Check the app when you get up and see how many drivers are out to be sure. Are airport trips attractive in your area? Big airport and far away? If yes then there must be plenty of drivers starting at the 4 am shift. 4 am is also the start of the rideshare rush hours.

If nobody has picked up your trip, maybe it's short. Just fake the destination until someone picks it up. Just an idea. Compensate the driver one way or the other."
$100 damage fee?!,12,108.78204736738293,Lyft,Got a Lyft at 7:00AM the other day. Driver picked me up at a hotel and dropped me off home. Sat in the front seat. Small talked with the driver.

It was just an ordinary Lyft ride.,"did they send you photos of the damage? when i reported someone for making a mess in my car, lyft said they forwarded the photos to the woman who caused it. They should send you pictures with ""proof"" of whatever the damage is. Assuming he's scamming you expect to see some laughably fake spill like nacho cheese all over the seat or an obviously 3 year old stain on the seat claiming to be from you. You can either contest it with lyft to see if they relent or you can file a chargeback with your CC to get refunded. If you do this Lyft will ban you for life. This is what some drivers who work for peanuts resort to.  They need to get a real full-time job instead of doing this to passengers and causing bad impressions on Lyft service which affects other drivers across U.S. and the Canada. Dispute it.

Nightmare service.,16,108.99837838591525,Lyft,"Anyone have experience driving passengers for this service? Picked up an elderly pax who needed significant assistance getting out and in the car, was unbearable about asking me to turn on and off the radio, and then was furious that I wouldn’t wait at her drop off location and take her on a shopping day. It seems super unsafe that Lyft lets this service order rides for customers if they don’t have working phones to order another ride. I felt bad leaving her but had other passengers in the queue. Called her assisted living place, Lyft, the store, and the service and nobody really seemed to care.","You know I try my best to go the extra mile for my pax. But that is unacceptable. Honestly, Lyft and Uber need to add a wait time feature. I could spend all day on one drive but I want to be paid for it. I HATE this service.  I’m always getting morbidly obese older people who want me to put their giant wheelchairs in my trunk.  I have a really bad back and I’m not supposed to lift anything over 20 lbs.  Then of course they get bent out of shape for every little thing (A/C, radio, etc).  I started canceling if I got a go go grandma text.  I’ve had one or two who smelled like they peed themselves too.  The last one was a extremely entitled guy who screamed at me for following the gps.  I had it and went off on him. Never again Screw that service indeed. It's a guaranteed no gratuity, a short, unprofitable ride, and you often have to get out and help them oftentimes with their wheelchair, oxygen tank, walker, or some combination of the three. You never know it's a GGG until after you accept a ride and they send that stupid text. I'm tempted to reply back, tell them to f*** off, and cancel it outright, but then I'd be deactivated. Yes! I tried to be nice do one. Picked up an elderly woman who needed to go to cvs in the next town over.

LYFT doesnt give me driections to the destination, just a note saying ask the person where they are going. Only thing available to me is a pick up option and a drop off option at the same place.

Im to nice and deside to do it, but half way there, she tells me she forgot her wallet and needs to go back to where i picked her up.

So i take her back. She says, are you going to wait for me. I say i need gas and cant do this. She says do what you want, gets out and goes to get wallet.

I quickly end the ride and leave. Made maybe 3.75. I bet round trip it would of been 5 dollars at most for nearly 30 minutes of my time.

Whats your story? I refuse gogoparents now because of that lady. so i was on my way down to a bigger city to work lyft one day and i was on the freeway and i got a lyft from “go go grandparent” and he lived almost 25 mins down the road i had to get off of. he lived in this “neighborhood” that was all unkept dirt roads but it wasn’t desolate cuz there was a ton of houses just spread out so i go all the way out there and pick him up and he’s this old dude and he’s nice and we’re talking and he’s like super polite and we get up to a “intersection” and he’s telling me “ok so if we go up here you wanna take the road towards the top, or you could go the other way and it’s easier on your tires” so i’m like “oh ok so i think i’m just gonna go the second way cuz i came from there and it’ll be fine on my tires” 
and i start driving that way and he starts violently SCREAMING at me, and at first i’m not sure he’s talking to ME, i thought maybe he was continuing the story or whatever he was telling so he just keeps screaming 
STOP!!! STOP!! STOP THE FUCKING CAR WHY WONT YOU STOP!!!!! 
and i slam the brakes when i realize he’s yelling at me and i’m like in shock and he just keeps going 
“ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! WHY WOULDNT YOU TAKE THE WAY I TOLD YOU?! ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?! WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU!!!” and i’m like “EXCUSE me?! i hope you don’t think you’re talking to ME like that!!” and he’s like “YEAH I AM, CUZ YOU FOR SOME REASON DONT KNOW HOW TO FUCKING LISTEN, I TOLD YOU TO GO UP NOT TO THE LEFT WHY WOULD YOU GO LEFT WHEN I SPECIFIED YOU GO STRAIGHT?!”
and i’m like “do you want me to turn around??” and he’s like “YEAH, NO SHIT THATS WHERE I TOLD YOU TO GO”
and i’m like “you know what i’m gonna take you home, is that what you want??” and he just looks at me and is like “you know what yeah PLEASE take me home because you’re so stupid and incompetent i hate stupid people just take me home. i can’t believe you can’t fucking listen, you’re so STUPID!!”
and i slam my breaks and i’m like “get the hell out of my car you can walk you do NOT talk to me like that get the HELL OUT OF MY GODDAMN CAR”
and he grabs all his shit and his cane and gets out and starts yelling at me and i’m like LEAVE!!!! and i swore he was about to bust my windshield with his cane but he didn’t and he’s like “YOU WILL BE REPORTED!!!” and i start laughing and go OKAY whatever 😂 and he slams my door and i made his ass walk home. 
i don’t care if you’re old you don’t treat me like that in my car. i don’t accept gogograndparent rides anymore.

\- What's your average hourly wage?  What city are you in?

\- Do I need to clear out all passenger seats?  I like to keep my lunch in the passenger seat and munch while I drive, how often do you get all seats filled?

\- Do I need to have an empty trunk?  How often are trips made to the airport?  
\- Should I get a rear-facing dash cam? (any experiences/opinions appreciated)

\- Do people sit in the front or the back?

\- Do I need to tell my car insurance company?  


Thanks for your time.","I’m fairly new myself, so I can’t answer ALL of these but I will say keep all your seats clean and available for guests because you never know when somebody is gonna need to or want to sit in passenger seat. Average hourly wage can vary depending on ride quality and quantity. For me it averaged out to be about $10 a ride. Can be higher or lower. Los Angeles area for reference.

You should keep all seats available. Lyft allows riders to occupy as many seatbelts your car's VIN has. There's also shared rides. A lot of time people will ""isolate"" themselves by sitting next to you if there is someone already in the back seat. Really no way to predict how many people a non-shared Lyft will have. So be prepared.

Same with the trunk. I keep a small gym bag in there. Never had an issue. But I do have a roomy trunk. I do airport runs nearly daily. So yeah... Room is needed.

No cam on my car... So no advice there. Don't feel I need it.

People will sit where they feel like. Most pax ride in the pax side rear seat. Easy to get in and out. Occasionally, you will get a friendly pax that sits up front with you.... But mostly, they sit in the back.


And yes. You absolutely need Rideshare insurance. For one, you will lose your insurance if they discover you're Lyfting without it. And for another, if you're in an accident while on the job, you may as well be uninsured. Don't pick up people wearing your pajamas. Some things are obvious.

Drive how like how you want to be driven.  Do you want your driver to be munching while he's driving?  Hell no.  Don't eat while your driving, do you want your driver to have crap in his trunk?  No.  Give it some thought. I can answer for Uber and Uber Eats.

Didn’t know I had an amphibious vehicle,4,109.44707051555591,Lyft,Image,"The Duck Ride tour people are cashing in I've seen that a few time around SF.

Used to traverse the serengeti of your life, only fitting to use that for your passengers. 1.65 in the water lol. but the entire joke is that 1.65 wait in the zone prey you get a ride soon.  likely wait 2 hours for that ping"
A QUESTION for you more experienced drivers...,34,109.63483671927067,Lyft,"i have heard some local people (here in a busy market like Los Angeles) say that they just sit back and wait for the really long or good rides to come in (as opposed to taking anything that comes in).

They say that they just turn down whatever comes in, and keep not accepting, unless its a long ride.

They say that they would rather do one long trip per hour, and just reject everything else that comes in.

With them saying things like ""i would rather do just one long trip per hour, as opposed to 4 shorter trips"".

Anyway... my question is, when a ride comes in, how do you know how far the trip will be? and where its going to?

All i see is the type of ride (lyft or pool) and the pick-up location, But I do not see the final destination when i get the ping request.

How is it even possible, when a ping comes in, to know if its going to be a long trip? or a short one?  and where its even going to?

I can not see it on the app, but maybe I'm not looking in the right place?

Anyway, if anyone knows, can you let me know?","If it’s a long trip, it will day (45+ minutes) or similar when it sends the request. If you keep your acceptance rate high you see more info. 

If you’re doing it full time, you still want the short rides for weekly bonuses. Keep in mind, this strategy can kill you if you don't get a ride back.  And here in LA, +45 should absolutely be avoided in rush hour on Lyft due to primetime being gone. On Uber with surge okay.

PPZ has changed the game. With flat rate surge, you only want short rides. I usually don't have luck with waiting for the long rides. Realistically, I find that I'm more productive if I take the smaller rides and let them guide me around town. The thing to take into consideration is that with long rides, you can't always guarantee a return trip. Unlike trips to the airport, it could be less profitable to take one long  trip than several little trips that could have been done in the same time frame. If you reject enough rides to drop below 90% acceptance rate (which happens quickly), it stops showing you their destinations. So yes you can skip one or two but then it becomes a gamble because you can't see the destination after it dips below 90% Yeah That is terrible advice. Imagine you’re waiting 30 minutes for a 45+ minute ride. In that 30 minutes you could have made an extra $10-15 AND have a 45+ minute ride. When they claim to make $30/hr I have a hard time believing. A lot of time they only consider drive time as work time, but waiting for a ride also counts as time. You wait 45 minutes for a 45 minute ride that pays like what, $30-$40? You didn’t just make $30-$40 in 45 minutes. You did it in an hour and a half - 2 hours depending on how long till your next ride. That's logic from 2 years ago.  You need to maximize your time.  Run both apps, ignore pings more than 6 or 7 minutes away.  Ignore pool or shared.  You'll learn to recognize busy areas.  Churn and burn. Yeah, wait a few hours for a 45 mins ride and can't get a ride back, so you wasted almost 2 hours making like what? 30? In this time you can do a bunch of short ride that would be 20 total and don't cost nearly as much gas. You are finally starting to at least try to figure out how to drive ride share effectively. Maybe you will start to make what the majority of LA drivers make."
WTF,4,110.063170052604,Lyft,"So I was picking a passenger up downtown during rush hour. The address they put in was on a one way street with no parking. I pull up and put on my hazards, hoping they’ll be right out. No sign of anyone, so I call the pac and she keeps shouting, “I’m at Target!”—which is about a block and a half behind me. There’s construction downtown, and coupled with traffic, I would be a nightmare to get back to her. 

So I cancelled the ride, thinking she’ll probably get another one right away that’s closer to her. I then immediately get another pick-up. Next thing I know, the original pax is blowing up my phone. She left me a ton of nasty voicemails and texts about how she was going to call Lyft and tell them I took her money and didn’t pick her up. 

When I tried to text her back, I got a bot response saying my message wouldn’t be forwarded. So how is it she can continue to call/text me while I’m on a ride with another pax, but I can’t contact her? I thought their ability to contact us was gone after the ride is cancelled/over?","you did the correct thing the pick up was not worth it .   just ignore messages and texts who cares ? I had this with some students a few months back. I arrived at their destination, (condos in a crowded marketplace) waited the five minutes, called, and nothing. The whole time, I was looking at the yellow man icon 20 feet away from where I was parked not moving an inch. On top of this, the passenger had no avatar, so I eventually canceled and got the $5. Then I get a call from him chastising me that he was going to miss class. (nine mile drive to campus.) Too bad, pal!"

"When a PAX says ""I'll tip you in the app!""",31,110.13648023780023,Lyft,Image,"I almost always tip on the app, like 90% of the time.  I don’t always have cash and being able to tip in the app is super convenient. 1 out of 2 passengers did tip after telling me that. Both drunk, lol. What are the pychological reasons why they say they do but won't? I've gotten used to not expecting it. It's less disappointing when you assume they won't tip rather than assuming they will. In my experience,  if they say they'll tip they most likely won't, I swear its gotta be at least 90%.  I don't understand why they would even bring it up. I was actually talking to my partner about this earlier today and decided to keep track and run the numbers to show how shitty pax can be. If they say they will tip, they definitely won't. I dont get it. I always tip from the app. That's why I like lyft. Its not even discussed. I dont even carry cash. Ever. Been thinking of ending a ride the moment a pax says that. Gonna do tonight.  😂 Just tell them how much you appreciate the tip as if they did give it to you. Say things like ""It really means a lot."" but don't get desperate or demanding. You want to make them feel good about doing you a good deed. If they get a whiff of entitlement or obligation, then your odds drop considerably. It’s cool.  I remember them.  All the ones that say they will, and then don’t, get 1 Star.  I wouldn’t have cared if they didn’t say anything at all ... but then they had to go and lie.  Liars get 1 Star. I always tip in the app,  unless funds are too low. My driver on one trip said that the passengers traveling on business trips frequently don't tip, which is particularly shitty given that they are expensing the cost.

Do you find that the percentage-based tip suggestions have improved earnings? V 11231 r Just a thought...Automatic 1 star for pax who say this. I imagine they might say this to every driver for whatever reason. I know the star rating system means nothing for pax, but It'd be nice to get a heads up when accepting a ride.

Imposters,6,110.5516191267029,Lyft,"I saw an article in a Denver news source that stated a woman was almost abducted by a fake driver. With the amount of things that have to align (driver knowing pax name, type of car, GPS tracking of car, license plate) how are people getting into the wrong vehicles? I hate to put blame on victims in cases like this but I'm genuinely curious how that happens?","they just get in . not paying attention Just outright fucking stupid. Fuck em all. I go to pickup at the airport yesterday and some lady comes up to my car, told her nope not me. Then she goes up *to the very next car* that was *completely* different. We're talking a fucking silver SUV vs a black sedan. He also tells her no ma'am. Then she starts walking down to what is likely going to be the next car, which was a red wagon... hollllly christ. At first I was going to flame the article and the writer but then after taking a step back it's not that farfetched. When I worked a club night downtown once, I accidentally picked up a snooty prick and went a solid 6-7 mins before we realized we were not a match (yes, that was my education on confirming names EVERY time someone opens the door).

So a malcontent could easily troll the club scene when everyone is good and wasted for their next victim. A dash light or sticker for authenticity but I can tell you I never ever used mine and have had zero pushback or static on account of their absence. I’ve only been driving for a few months and have had several people get in my car that did not belong. For the most part it’s amusing and they quickly realize their mistake. Early one morning I had a scheduled pickup and had been waiting for several minutes when some guy got in my backseat and didn’t seem to understand that I was absolutely not there to pick him up. I finally got him out of my car but he decided to stand on the sidewalk and stare at me, literally a foot away from my door. He didn’t even have a phone visible so I’m not sure if he was just that drunk or what. It was certainly a weird experience."
Update on California drivers being labeled as employees,19,110.57087838596217,Lyft,Image,"An independent contractor needs to see the exact destination and pay BEFOREHAND before making a decision to accept a job. If you can “fire”someone after changing their mind after they accept the vague terms, you are a direct employee. 

Some Delivery gig  apps are exempt from this. They often  show you the expected pay and location. Then you have time to choose to accept. That’s 1099. 

If I legally hire someone as a 1099 to do physical labor like yard work and do not tell him how long it will take, how much he will make and not even where it is and he only has a few seconds to say yes or no and after that face severe penalties if he changes his mind, how does that sit with a court? Oh one last thing, he can’t sue anyway. He was forced into signing an arbitration agreement. The headline has a total lie in it:

total lie

if there's a lie like that in the headline, i cant trust the article.

Its 2019.

Time to give workers the basic employee rights.  End of story.

No matter how much these companies lie, and claim they'll go bankrupt, don't believe them, they have billions.

They are not going anywhere, and hey... if they need to save money, there are plenty of things to cut before reducing the already poverty-level wages of us drivers. By rating the drivers they are employees. 

>A. The person is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact.

By sending the driver  ""warnings"", which are suggestions on how to be a ""better driver"", they are employees. If Lyft stopped at not pairing drivers and riders, that would be fine. > Wall Street analysts say that Uber and Lyft drivers are likely to pass the test - and that the change could bankrupt both companies.

Driver support ignoring responses,2,110.57867931189914,Lyft,Anyone deal with this before? Generally Uber support is responsive albeit with pre-canned copy/past responses however Lyft lately has been totally ignoring support messages and responses.,It seems like they’ve gotten slower. I’ve noticed that it’s been taking them 4-7 hours to get back to you. Its true I called them up two days ago  waited  15 min to be connected and she gives me a lame excuse saying what am asking about is out of her reach and she needs to escalate it to different department  and to this moment no ones gotten back to me.

Lyft deletes the lowest rating each week - which humorously means that the lowest rated ride still affects your overall rating but does not show up on your weekly report It is an average of your last seven days now I've been told by Uber that cancellations lower your rating for both drivers and riders. Not sure if Lyft does the same. I have this exact same problem. I don't know what to do about it either. I have this same issue. I’ve been 5 stars for over 700 rides and last week it dropped, but I haven’t had any ratings below 5 stars. I thought it's based on the last 500 rides.  So a 4.96 means you got 496 five star rides out of the last 500."

Lyft is updating the way your pay is calculated,11,110.81800801562491,Lyft,Image,"What they will do is lower your per mileage pay 40-50% then raise your per minute pay 10%.

The new people never see this because they haven't been around but all the veterans (who are left) do see it because we've watched our pay get lower and lower each and every time. This is another thinly veiled pay cut.  This is the same verbiage they used last time they pulled the per minute / per mile shift.  The ""accept"" pay amount is unspecified but is surely designed as a distractor from an overall cut. >In a recent survey, over 1,000 drivers across the country let us know you value time over distance.

I'm an independent contractor though so how about I pick which I want? Another no lube sandpaper dildo Any drop in pay is unfair and intolerable. Getting rid of prime time for ppz is a perfect example. 


In 20 rides, NOT being paid for time to a pickup equals about 1.5 hrs of free work they get out of us, plus miles and gas. It’s so fucked up! Drivers should not have to take a pay cut in order to get paid for time they are working! Translation: minfares are now $1 so you still only make $3 driving 20 minutes to pick someone up. And they wonder why the CA legislature is gunning for their asses. Well, this could actually be good, unless the they mean they'll lower the per mile rate in favor of increasing the per minute rate, at which point it's a pay cut, and would maybe even out with the pay coming from hitting accept. This at best encourages more drivers to drive at peak times, which is hell, and personally I don't want to, even if sitting in a traffic jam is more profitable. Very non-specific in the actual values they are changing"
"PPZ- Bad for drivers, unknown to passengers, sneaky Lyft",8,111.05149181192121,Lyft,"I am a driver in the Dallas/Fort Worth area who does about 50-60 hours each week, and I have about 800 rides under my belt. Despite driving up and down the dark surge areas on the daily, I only ever get the PPZ around 10-15 minutes from these areas, even if they are on my normal routes.

These PPZ are effectively a means to corral drivers into desired areas, in hopes of that extra dollar fiddy, and the highest I've reached was $5.40, but didnt get the ride out of there and had to drive 8 miles back to actually populated areas. I haven't even seen one in my last hundred rides!

From what I can gather from my passengers fares, I have determined that PPZ is just simply used to take the entire chunk of surge prices, while selectively dropping a couple dollars here or there to sate the driving masses. An airport ride can cost your passenger 40+ while you only receive $15, during rush hour traffic. A rider paying that much is much less likely to tip, seeing as they are paying a decent sum already, and based on my interactions with riders, many assume that a decent amount of exorbitant surge prices they pay go to their drivers-to us- though we know that simply isn't the case.","I maintain the stance that Lyft is the worst (legal) employer in the United States at the moment. Far more than uber. 

The fact that the Department of Labor hasn’t investigated them yet means the federal government endorses this corporate abuse. 

I can’t wait for them to sink and burn. Zimmer and Green cam go hide in some luxury bunker and avoid the masses, what do they care, nothing will ever happen to them. 

PS- Lyft doesn’t have enough capital to raise a fleet of self-driving cars like Uber. They are done within a few years. First time I saw PPZ on the app I parked and let the amount go up.  I probably sat for about 45 minutes (estimated) and the bonus was up to $19.  I had never seen it before so I decided to wait and see.  It hit $20 then immediately disappeared.  No rides, sat in a deaf spot and wasted almost an hour waiting for a fake bonus.  I thought, WTF Lyft!!?  That was a terrible first impression of PPZ. Dont be afraid of declining rides. What happens if you sit in the ppz area and just deny people?"
First NSFW ride,23,111.13981357118045,Lyft,"     I started driving lyft about a month ago and its been going well. This past week i relocated temporarily to a bigger city and my first Saturday night presented my first nsfw ride. I picked up my pax at a club around 2am and this girl was drunk so my first thought is ""Alright we are driving you home."" Nope we are going to another night club go figure. 

     On the way she asks to vape which i don't mind but she is so drunk she can't figure out how to operate the vape. She was real chatty and things were going good. As we approach the club we are probably 500-800 feet down the street and I can see the club she sees an open spot on the side of the street between parked cars and says to pull over there. 

     I was abit confused why i couldnt just drop her off at the club but she insisted so I pulled over. She then proceeds to say that she needs to piss badly and determines that its time to piss on the side of the road. I'm laughing abit as it was unexpected and she asks for a napkin or something before she commences I keep some sanitized wetwipes on hand so I offered her one. She then uses my passenger doors both front and back as shields to take her bathroom break. 

     I turn my head away to be polite but as she was urinating the thought literally hit me. She was not wearing a dress or a shirt and pants. This girl was wearing one of those 1 piece full body rompers which means she basically stripped down to near naked to take a piss on the side of the street outside of my car. 

     After she got down she thanked me for the wipe and then had me end the ride and she walked the rest of the way. She tipped me well afterwards but I was floored about it for the rest of the night.","It may not be profitable .... but at least it's never boring + ) Classy lady like that and you didn’t even try to get her number? shopping list: disposal urinal, female adaptor, super gel Picked up pax about 30 min from the downtown club scene, where she was going.

Almost all were interested and appreciative. In doing so, I also found out a lot about crappy driver-tricks too from said pax. Interesting all around. Just not a lot of rides. Remember there's drivers 1 starring non-tippers so ratings mean nothing. Drove a 4.3 in silence to the airport, 5$ tip. Shrug.

I think below a 4 is satan. LMFAO I needed that laugh man nice 😂 Maybe he's just misunderstood... I mistakenly accepted a 4.2 last week... she had a ""two stop"" ride at a Walmart, said she'd ""just be a minute-- needed a moneygram"". She left her bag so I couldn't leave and only emerged from that Walmart 40 minutes later with a cartload of groceries, banged up my car loading them, demanded I help load and unload and... naturally, no tip (though several promises!).

I don't really use Lyft often (probably 2-3 times a month, usually a weekend), but have been considering it more since the bus I take has been spotty lately and as the summer goes on I would rather not wait in the hot weather for the bus. 

At least this new $15 version of the pass is better than the $300 and $250/month (or something like that) that they kept trying to get me to sign up for last year.","mine lists a ""discount"" to $9.99/mo for 10% off.  but yeah, even that is still not worth it for me at the rate I use it. This is targeted at daily commuters  and longer trips. If you are spending $100 a week on rideshare, you will save 45-50 bucks with this over the course of a month. 

&#x200B;

they are hoping $10-15 bucks to get 50 back is worth it to you and it's worth it to them to give you an incentive to CHOOSE LYFT v. other rideshare options that may be available in your market. It's sort of like Amazon Prime, if you are spending 10-15 bucks a month to get that 2 day delivery and all the other perks, why would you even check wal mart? You get the idea. These *deals* are structured to profit the company while only a small percentage of customers will see any positive benefit, even by a couple bucks.

I haven't seen a lot of ""we need to go back to the old system"" posts.  I'd like to drive more Lyft lol, been doing a lot of Uber since the change. Seriously though. Where is the motivation to drive anymore. We dont have ppz in my market, still get pt but even those are rare now. They pop up and dissappear super quick. Even if im in an pt zone, they give me non pt rides which i refuse to do. 

I learned from this forum that if it's not surging its not busy. EVEN though the graphs claim it will be busy, there are at least  16 other ridesharing cars doing this so why bother. ( lyft + uber show 8 cars available)

I've maintained a 4.98 rating but my acceptance rate is 9%. The market is over saturated with ""eager beaver"" drivers willing to drive pax around for ""peanuts"" when lyft is making the real cash. 

These ppz zones are a way to limit our intake  but increase lyfts amount by overcharging passengers. 

I for one went from a everyday driver to ""what's the point."" They are lowering pay, making us work longer to make up for that loss and putting us in horrible situations often going to places we dont wanna go.

Streaks arnt even worth it. First two rides will be fine but when the 3rd is 20 + minutes away... i feel like i wasted my time trying to fullfill Lyft's needs, especially when it's suppose to be a 5 streak thing.

We need to reclaim the power here. This is my fault. I set my app to Lux Black, sit in the largest pink bonuses I find, max out, then drive off and when I get somewhere I want to pick someone up at, set it back to all rides.

I didn’t know about lyfts policy for firing drivers with stars under a threshold and I gave a driver two stars,5,112.63355199713949,Lyft,I had a driver never pick me up. I was in a cafe and my phone said my driver was approaching so I left to go out but once I went outside my app said I was just dropped off and “thanks for your ride!” And it charged my card and immediately went to the tip/rate page. I thought I got scammed so I gave the driver 2 stars. Now I feel bad cause maybe it was just an error/glitch and the driver didn’t do anything on purpose. Will my 2 star review do any damage to the drivers career?,"A) contact Lyft and get your money back because wtf. Maybe he looked at your destination and decided he didn’t want to go there so he did what he did instead of cancelling? Which is dumb but whatever. 

B) your rating alone won’t hurt him. We have to hit 4.6 to be deactivated, but that’s super hard unless the driver really really sucks. Only our last 100 ratings matter, and any rides where the passenger doesn’t leave a rating get 5 stars automatically.

Edit: Missed the part where you said it might be a glitch. If he’s got an old version of the app it’s possible, but it’s a stretch tbh. stars mean nothing . Contact for a refund and fuck that guy, who cares if a scammer loses his “job” Lol the ""driver's career"""
Tips,7,112.63474412676912,Lyft,When your a driver for lyft do they give you the tips on the app or cash tips?,"Most of the time it’s done through the app. I have had some passengers tip cash, especially airport runs with a lot of luggage Well if you live near a university those are great spots to get rides. Also tech or business areas are good for group lunch runs or even airport rides after a morning meeting They can give you cash or tip in the app. Most people who tip do it through the app. With that being said expect about 5-10 percent of the riders to tip you. Some days you’ll get a lot of tips and other day you won’t get a single tip. When I signed up I figured the majority of people tip just like any other service industry. How wrong I was."
Possible glitch?,10,112.66259134900515,Lyft,I haven't even driven 250 riders yet and I got the invite to accept the AMP. Do you suppose I'll see it in the mail? Or was this possibly a malfunction?,"Definitely a glitch, I know someone who hasn’t even taken their first drive who got the same message.

Well, at least you can throw it up on eBay.  I got it this morning and I’ve only done 172 rides....of course I accepted it, let’s see if it ever shows up lol I mean they just give them out.

Child safety seats please!,1,112.68413070085701,Lyft,"I had a rider once that opened door and baby was in a car seat and she was messing with the belt and closed door and seat belted herself in and I drove away. Baby was sound asleep and the handle of car seat in up position ready to be carried. While I was driving I was going really slow in a parking lot and I went over this RIDICULOUS speed bump. Baby bounced in the back seat and handle hit the roof and the car seat flipped over upside down in the back seat. Baby started crying and I asked the rider in a very concerned voice “Is the baby ok?!” She said “yes the baby was asleep and just got startled”. The baby was at least belted in the seat so it didn’t fall out of the car seat. She never actually strapped it to the car. I told the lady to properly belt the seat down. She did. I’m pretty sure the baby pooped it’s diaper. Please people no matter how short the ride, always strap them safely in the car. I will double check and make sure that never happens again. *HUMPH*","Those people are criminals, you should give them 1 Star and report them to Lyft. They are making you a criminal by being criminals themselves. You could also refuse to accept the ride and report them through the emergency call center.

Driver had a two year old in the front seat of the car,57,112.87810060827543,Lyft,"I recently took a Lyft, and the driver had a two year old in the front seat of their car. I did not realize there was a child in the car until we were already underway. It was so small that it was hidden by the seat and door. This child did not have a car seat and was only strapped in by the waist portion of the seat belt. Should I report the driver? I was extremely uncomfortable as this is unsafe, and I think illegal. I was dropped off at my apartment. I'm always nervous about reporting when the driver knows where I live.","Personally if I saw that I think I would feel I had to report it. Highly illegal Report please!  What is that person doing???  If that was the parent, absolutely horrible parenting.  Totally illegal and that person shouldn't be driving doing stuff like that Maybe it was a midget, was this a shared ride ?? You should have called the police I’ve reported a few scary drivers as unsafe to Uber and no ones come to my house for retaliation. The drivers have no idea that it was you who reported them. Call the police Erm, no. I’m a driver and I know I can’t have anyone else, not even a child in the car aside from my passengers. Report this. That is not ok... My wife drives Uber eats sometimes with our four year old in a carseat in back and brings our kid in to pick up food. Makes decent money compared to what child care costs here, but if she wants to drive Uber she waits until night and doesnt endanger our child. For others who may not read all the way through: Before I read through all the comments, I assumed the driver was probably too poor to afford a child car seat, but it is still illegal and extremely dangerous to: 1)have the child in the car with just the vehicle seat belt; and 2) in the front passenger seat. In my state, children are not supposed to ride in front until they are at least 9 and at least a certain height and weight. Clearly, this child was neither. 

Your statement that the car was an expensive SUV and she had a new phone tells me that money and desperation is not the cause, possibly ignorance or negligence. You should use the anonymous reporting system with Lyft. It's too late to call the police as they cant' do anything. It's quite alarming you're asking if you SHOULD report this.

I absolutely would to the cops, in addition to Lyft. Definitely report. I would have reported immediately. Even try to sneakily take a pic to prove it so that they don’t take his word for it and reactivate him. We are not supposed to bring anyone along, there needs to be 4 available seats (including the front seat) for passengers and what this driver did was illegal and stupid. Don't worry about them knowing it was you, reports are anonymous and your name doesn't appear in our ride history after 24 hours and neither does the address. How do you know it was 2? Did you have a conversation with driver? Did you ask about the kid? That's very bad, but car seats aren't much of a thing in a lot of the world so I would guess that maybe it's ignorance if they are new here. There's no excuse if they are American though. Report and call 911. This is the same amount of illegal as a driver who is falling asleep at the wheel or who blows stop signs. Report it."

Something bizarre happened with ride cancellation this morning,3,113.94981357127428,Lyft,"So I frequently use both Uber/Lyft and I use whichever one has the shorter wait ETA (cost is non factor to me since I get reimbursed anyways) and this morning it was Lyft. I'm in PNW region btw.

So I wait 6 minutes for my ride, he gets here on time, I get in, everything is great. Then I get a notification on my phone saying the ride was cancelled, similar to the one you'd get when driver cancels on you. I know for a fact that the driver didn't cancel it because he was already driving when I got that notification and he wasn't using his phone.

He was just as confused and frustrated. I ended up getting out because he was matched with another customer and I with another drive. But this whole experience was really shitty and made me think twice about using Lyft again.

Funny thing is I asked my next driver if that ever happened to him and he said it happened once in all year. But the fact that it does happen is super bizzare in my opinion.","It is the standard stupid Lyft thing. When a driver accepts a request, he may be canceled (not even re-matched) en route by Lyft while the trip is given to another driver. I think this is a cover-up of a deficiency in their platform. In your case, I think the re-matching happened too late when you are already boarded.

Yes, this is stupid for riders. Double stupid shit for drivers. But if they stop doing this, I will not be surprised when other much more stupid shit happens."
“I’ll tip you on the app”,49,114.03188533053354,Lyft,Image,"I hear that shit all the time. I just wish they wouldn’t say anything at all. I tip on the app every time (I also work at a steakhouse and some of my coworkers live off tips,lol) I have even tipped when service was below average...because shit happens.

I’ll say this about lyft...I use it daily to get to work and have NEVER been late...super early cause the driver was 2min from my house but NEVER late.

I’ll tip to that Why would passengers communicate about a tip anyway? Even if they tip in-app, why do they need to tell the driver? I provide bottles of water when requested, Cliff bars, I have four charging cables (two iPhone Lightning, one USB-C, one Micro USB), and I have a passenger data hotspot via Tmobile. Most of my passengers use the data connection, phone cables, and many take the bottles of water. I'm lucky if I get between 2-4 tips per day when I average about 20-25 rides a day in the Atlanta market. I'm very friendly and I always hear ""I'll tip in the app."" It never happens. You don't have to tip, but don't lie about it. Or you can tip me right now (: ""I'll tip you as soon as I am outside of your presence""

Sure you will bud.... Sure you will I guess I can also just not. Ha, I’ve been driving for like 4 months and I heard that for the first time a couple weeks ago. The guy actually did tipped me the following day <.< “Oh, show me right now :) haha” Mine are getting better. Was promised 15 and 5 and got both. 2 great riders. I started saying “Don’t worry about it. Have a nice day” they actually started tipping lmao. 

When I say “Thank you so much. Much appreciated “ no tip. 

The irony 😂 Lmao so true I’ve never had a passenger say they’re gonna tip me on the app and not tip me. I used to give tips when I rode Ubers. When I switched to Lyft, I tipped through the app. And I always tip even for shitty drivers.

I never say anything about it though. LOL I'm sure some people just forget. I have been guilty of that. If I get to my destination and have to start at something right away I will definitely look up at my emails or statements 3 days later like ""omg nooo I forgot to tip and rate them they probably hate meeee!"" ..... Then again, I never SAY I'm going to tip them.....

That's not to say they're aren't people who deliberately say it just to have something to say at the end of a ride, but I can believe it's the smaller percentage of pax lol. Anyone who tries to feed me this story and doesn't come through gets a 3 star. Again, you all must be terrible drivers or live in a shit area. When people tell me that here in San Diego, 100% of the time a tip shows up. Always. Have fun sucking?"

No permanent damage but piece of shit move Random pedestrian tried to tear my mirror off, while I had 3 passengers in the car.

Not sure if mentally unstable or drugs/alcohol. Went from irate to concerned real quickly. Ended that ride while talking with 911. Happened in daylight too, about 4pm on that day. I had a young lady throw a unopened water bottle at my head. It was crazy lol. I also had 2 very drunk passengers get so mad I think one of them tried to damage my car as I drove off after making them exit the vehicle when I ended their ride prematurely. I pretty much try to be merely a provider of a ride these days and be friendly-ish and polite but rarely do I encourage heavy interaction. Ensure their comfort and really just allow them to fend for themselves and safely get them to their point b. I used to provide water and gum and chargers and hand wipes and hand sanitizer and tissues but it all got stolen repeatedly so I stopped all of that all together. 

Having said all that, both of those incidents happened without any heavy interaction so"
WTF is this bullshit from Lyft now? The app talks to you and tells you to stay in the red box for more money,27,114.79283440461865,Lyft,Image,"It seemed to be doing this to me in a really dead area after every ride to keep me on Lyft only.  

So when I ended a ride, I immediately got a PZ in a place that would never have a PZ normally (slow neighborhood at a slow time).  

After a few minutes I'd max out around double the original and it'd make me stay in the pink zone, I could leave and come back if I wanted though.  After a few minutes more it'd turn grey like that and clear the zones entirely so I would get the bonus anywhere.  Drove back to civilization and got the bonus.

This happened 3 times in a row.  Wasn't very lucrative, honestly. so far I'm not hating the implementation of this in L.A. like I thought I would.  
You can just ignore them, or camp in the red/purple for 5 minutes while it maxes out.  
Then you can just drive out of there and you still get the bonus. prime time was so much better. for drivers. 

power zones are also better. for lyft A - it PINK

And B.... Yeah it's bullshit. Late to the party I see?

You’ve been #LYFTED! Get with Uber now if u haven’t- seriously. When Lyft gives u $1 for a “Personal Power Zone”, uber has “sticky surges) that usually pay out 5-10 times more than Lyft PPZ- no joke.

Of course, customer still pays the same...u/Lyft just takes that money for themselves. No wonder California is out to destroy them. So there copying door dash basically. I still have never seen one of these in my area (Phoenix) Holy moly! Youre going to be rolling in the dough! It talks to you? Huh I guess I'll keep mine on mute, it's nicer that way. Go to your messages in the app, I promise you you've gotten tons of notices and lots of emails about this. It's complete crap. Lyft is trying to make it seem like we are getting these great bonuses, but we are not even getting rides out of the area. Maybe one every 10 minutes if we our all lucky. It's crap Several times its been ok. Last night was real slow and i was surprised to see it in an area thats normally pretty good. I turned off uber and sat.   It eventually maxed out at $4.  Sat another 5 minutes so like 10 min now and decided to flip uber on and see what happens. Couple minutes later i get an uber ping and its just 3 minutes away so thinking maybe i can make this work out and get both so i accept it and keep lyft ap on and head that way. When im right down the street from the pickup sure enough i get the lyft bonus ping. Roll the dice and accept it. Get to the uber pickup and the guy comes out. Start trip and sure enough hes going across town. Have to cancel the lyft with the bonus. 2 days in a row I received these messages and did not get 1 ping from the pink and purple. Maybe it is a herding technique.

EDIT : Lyft has reactivated my account. Turns out she reported me for listening to porn on the radio. Passengers aren't enemies but they sure as hell don't let you trust them.","The only way is to sue Lyft. Go to the courthouse, file a lawsuit with an unknown defendant, ask for a warrant to compel discovery.....Lyft has to, and will respond with all the riders information.

Lyft and Uber only respond to being sued. Wild guess, but based on your post I think you know why. I'm guessing it was a disagreement that got loud. What exactly happened if you don’t mind me asking? Just hypothetically. 

Some people are classified as disabled but don't appear that way when looking at them, she probably called and said you refused her service based in her disability. 
 
You will have to spend time and money to rectify it.  Rideshare sometimes will just suspend you for a few days. I hope you get back on.

  Write them a note and explain your side of the story. If that person has had bad reports before they may unlock your account. I listen to podcasts too. But I never “make” the passenger listen to them too. They might get offended. Which is what happened here. 

Think about it from a pax perspective. 

They PAID for the ride. They don’t wanna listen tp anything that might offend them. I know the woody show, was it “who’s fart is this?” What was she offended by? Lol check your email You could’ve deescalated the situation,  the woman does sound horrible and it is your car but I mean you are in the service industry.... Still deactivated? This is Gods way of saying"" I love you child, please get off this stupid platform and utilize what I gave you.  Your better than this."" Yea. You did everything you could to motivate the passenger to report you. Next time stfu and turn off the podcast. (Or wear headphones like me) [deleted] I’ve read all this and honestly you are in the wrong , they are paying and it’s your responsibility to cater to them. Sounds like this isn’t for you You were reported for putting her out for no reason. You should be deactivated. First you pissed her off because she had to ask you to put her bag away when you should have helped her first then you should have turned your pre-recorded show off and played music.

Car broke down. New to Lyft worried about getting home from work at night and how Lyft works.,22,116.5093969046628,Lyft,Someone is giving me a ride to work in the morning but I come home at 9:00 at night. Just worried I will be left standing outside work with no way to get home. Should I be? Don't understand how this works. What if no one comes?,"I also have an anxiety disorder so I know how you feel. You should be okay though. 

How it works, generally:

- Open the app. It asks where you’re going. You put in your address. 
- It takes you to a screen with prices.  “Lyft” is the standard ride where you get the car all to yourself.  “Shared” is essentially a carpool; it’s cheaper than a regular ride BUT there’s a chance of other people being added along the way and might take you longer to get home. Both options will tell you an estimate of how long your trip will be, but it’s just an estimate. DO NOT pick anything except Lyft or Shared. The other options will cost you a lot more and you don’t need the features they offer. Tap the one you want and there’s a big purple button that says “Select [Lyft or Shared, depending on what you picked].”
- It takes you to the next screen where you confirm where you’re waiting. Sometimes the GPS isn’t accurate, so be sure to double check it OR you can just delete what the GPS guessed and type in the address of the place. 
- Hit “confirm pickup” when you’re sure the details are correct. This sends your request. It will tell you it’s looking for a driver. 
- Once a driver has accepted your ride, it will tell you they’re arriving in X minutes. Again it’s an estimate, but if you’re getting a ride at 9pm on a Sunday it should be pretty accurate because there shouldn’t be traffic or anything. It will also show you a route the driver is supposedly taking - don’t be alarmed if the driver isn’t following that route, because sometimes the GPS we use finds better routes than what Lyft thinks we should do. 
- You’ll also get the driver’s photo and name as well as the type, color, and license plate of the car. You can call or text if you need to get in touch, but I don’t recommend doing this unless absolutely necessary as it’s distracting to us. (I once had a woman who entered her location as being a CVS, and she immediately called me to say she was at a CVS, left a voicemail because I didn’t answer since I was driving, then she texted to say she was at CVS and wanted to make sure I knew since I didn’t answer my phone. Don’t be like her.) 
- Driver gets to you eventually, get in the car, go home and be happy. 

It’s obviously easier and faster to get a car in a bigger city than a small one, but you should be okay. Since the app tells you how far away the driver is you can definitely wait inside for them. You get alerted when they’re ~2 minutes away and then when they show up. If you pick the regular Lyft you then have 5 minutes to get to them. Drivers appreciate when you’re ready when they get there but you don’t have to stress about running out the door. If there are multiple doors where you’re waiting, just watch for them because we aren’t told which one and it’s almost impossible to tell on the map sometimes. 

Lastly, if you haven’t already set up the app with your payment info, do it before you go in to work. Sometimes it takes longer because the app is cranky so it’s just easier to get that sorted before you’re trying to get somewhere. I may be overthinking this, but i have an anxiety disorder so it comes with my brain, like it or not. How long do I wait out in the cold for my driver to come? I don't know if Lyft is a big entity here so concerned that there won't be a back-up driver. Just need a little help with understanding the process. I tried getting the Uber app on my phone but it wouldn't work for a bunch of reasons, none of which I totally understand. That is why I am a little concerned about whether or not Lyft is a big thing here in my area and I can rely that one driver will pick up if another one doesn't. ONce I have done it a couple of times I will be fine. If you downloaded the app you should be able to see the drivers in the area.  If you're not seeing any at any time then you might have a problem.  Get the number to your local taxi company, if all else fails call a cab.  But really, unless you work in the middle of nowhere, you can probably get a Lyft or Uber. ..... It pairs you to someone the closest. Rather it be 3 min or 15minutes. Just get ready to tip if they're more than 5 minutes away. If you sign up for the app it will come that's just how it works if it doesn't come get a different one don't stress you're overthinking it It is worth it in a pinch, but the price tag does add up after a few days... hope you get you car back soon : )"
I'm a conflicted new driver.,31,116.66489458986177,Lyft,"I've done very little driving so far, literally only two trips. I recently turned 21, and currently I'm just working a part time job that gets me roughly ~$11/hour. I don't have too many expenses right now besides contributing to rent and, occasionally, groceries, so I'm doing fine for myself right now.

Naturally, the idea of working when I want to work appeals to me, and as such I've been doing some research and I'm seeing a lot of complaints about the pay rate of both Lyft and Uber, and some articles saying drivers somehow make less than minimum wage. I'm not too caught up on wage changes this year, however, and I made a little over $40 my first (only) hour.

Obviously I know I can't expect to make that much per hour, and I do have other expenses in mind (oil, repairs and such). Do you guys think driving part time (most likely instead of my current job) can be good for me? I'd really appreciate any input at all from current drivers.","Depends where you live Work a little more to see the flow of market. Keep your job for now. If you work part time on your regular job, take Mon tue wed schedule, and leave thu fri sat for Lyft. If you have time to work for Lyft on mon-wed best time is early morning (5-6am) till noon. Weekends best time is after 7pm. 

Don’t expect $40 an hour, you just got lucky here. Usually it’s close to $20 and hour.

Good luck Both Lyft and Uber will favor new drivers for the first few months. Check back in after doing this for 6 months or more then evaluate your situation $40 an hour is not consistent, but you can probably expect to make more than $11, especially once they take taxes out. Why not try it for a couple of weeks before you quit to see if what I'm saying is true in your area? I think anyone who does this job more than a couple of months does so out of necessity, not ""weee this is fun!! I get to set my own hours!"". The biggest issue isnt the people you pickup but the losses you take driving them. So many worthless rides that pay 3 bucks or less that you actually lose money on after you factor in time and gas. Thats what will ultimately shift your opinion of this gig, when you realize just how much time you must waste in order to make some profit in the process. Some people equate it with a ""loss leader"" strategy, except in our case you take all the loss and lyft gets all the lead. 

Avg income in most cities is about $15/hr. In exceptional cities you can maybe eek out about $20/hr. Either way you only get out what you put into it. This job is a grind, meaning sitting on your ass putting in LOTS of hours."

Question for drivers!!!!,11,116.69512607135431,Lyft,"So my wife just told me it’s weird that I sit in the front seat during transport lol.

......is it? Am I breaking a rule?","I equate sitting in the front like using the urinal directly next to someone when there's a gap available. It's just weird. You dont know me, why are you trying to be so close to me? That being said I still allow it, and I'll talk to you too. But I'd prefer you sit in the back because honestly there is nothing I want to talk to you about and just want to finish my shift. Not a rule, but I expect people in the back seat.

I’ve sat up front on solo rides before too. Depends on the car and driver. [Y](https://Yes.It)es it is creepy I look as it’s easier to fight off a person in the front seat, so I encourage it at night The front seat is fine. I get a little paranoid when passengers sit directly right behind me. I sometimes want to but don’t look in my rearview mirror to see if they are ok or something and inadvertently make eye contact which then makes the ride awkward. Front = Chatty Kathy I like it. It's easier to chat and I usually get a tip. Front = no child locked doors when riding. If you really want a quiet ride politely ask Not at all. Enjoy the rides more when they sit up front
 
 
 This is Lyft not Uber.  If you dont want someone talking to you on a ride, drive the other. Front seat is OK just don’t change the radio or help yourself to my mints or charger cable without even asking. depends . on longer rides i could understand .  but on short rides i will straight out tell you  get into the back seat. not trying to get to know you  on a  7 or 15 minute trip.    so will say hour or longer trips i offer the front seat .  unless medical conditions  whatever seat helps you ..     and im a dirty dog . sexy ladies  a lot of them ask to sit up from  im happy with that."

Lyft needs to provide better services for their drivers - personal account,7,116.75416542320616,Lyft," Here's my Lyft summary for past 2 nights:

  
13.5 hours  
20 rides  
$130.26 total earned, including..  
$34.43 in tips (tipped on 55% of rides, which is very high.. average seems to be about 15-20% - math = 11/20, so avg $3/tip)  
So more math..  
\~$96 made just on base fares, not including gas (about 1 gal/hr @ $\~2.40/gal) and tolls (about $10-15, included in ""earnings,"" but still an expense to be deducted)  
In 13.5 hours..  
$7.11/hr.. still not deducting for gas and tolls (est -3.35/hr, combined)  
Yes, I'm saying I make less than $4/hr on base fares after basic expenses 💀💀💀 (not including complimentary waters, special tablet with pandora premium, daily cleaning, etc)  
For a 5.00\* driver with 1233 rides under his belt.

\*\*Lyft is GREAT for passengers because of lower fares and better safety and quality standards than uber, BUT they shouldn't be taking \~60% of each fare.. there's a reason why drivers are striking, if not outright quitting. It's not worth the time and effort.. they especially need to reward their top \*quality\* drivers, rather than only rewarding quantity.. they have bonuses for if you hit 60+ rides in a week, which used to be manageable when I was getting 2.25 rides per hour months ago, but not now with \~1.5..","If it's not surging, it's not busy. I've learned to ignore these daily graphs. I haven't quit yet but im driving a lot less.

I like to think im working on getting my acceptance rate down to single digits. The times of day where they claim it will be busy, i will get on, but decline almost every ride. Ride sharing has turned into a joke. This is why you multi-app....get with Uber too. Uber pays way more on surge these days in most markets, Lyft’s PPZ is crap and forces my hand to not drive for them essentially Your math shows what kind of driver you are. There are two types:

1. Those that work for Lyft

2. Those that work for themselves

Will my early-morning scheduled rides be reliable and on time?,5,117.52918857137914,Lyft,"I have to take Lyfts next week as part of my morning commute, and I'm admittedly very worried that a driver won't come and then I won't be able to get to work on time. (Thanks, anxiety.) If it is relevant at all, the rides are only 15-20 minutes long and I would be picked up 7:10-7:25 AM.","It's never a guarantee, however, I'd think at that time of morning, you'd have zero issues. You shouldn’t have a problem....

*BUT*...

I really hope you’re budgeting extra time to get to where you need to go. If it takes 15-20 mins to get another driver because the first one didn’t show up, will you be late? If the driver is on time, but they’re driving slowly, will you be on time? If you have a good passenger rating it shouldn’t be an issue. It's probably best if you don't make the pick-up window so long. Schedule the ride for the exact time you need it and please by ready at that time because if the driver arrives at 7:10, you need to be ready in 5 minutes to avoid being charged a $10 cancellation fee - he's not going to wait from 7:10 until 7:25, he's going to leave 5 minutes after he arrives no matter what time it is. Schedule the pick-up for 7:10am - that way if the driver who accepted the ride isn't making progress by 7:00am, Lyft will reassign it to someone else. If you make it between 7:10-7:25, they might not get anyone there until the last minute and then you'll be cutting it close."
Lyft Job Fulfillment,11,117.73148023805685,Lyft,"Hopeful future driver here. If you’re a Lyft driver, I was wondering if you get fulfillment from being a driver or if you JUST like/do it for the pay.

Do you find satisfaction from driving people around? Do you find conversation with riders interesting or tedious? Do you find quiet rides relaxing or boring?","If you’re in it for the money you might wanna go in a different direction It’s a good side hustle but it’s not sustainable. I drive in Los Angeles, and on a good day I can make $100-120 for 8 hours of my time (not Lyft time), Lyft time is just time getting to a passenger and driving them somewhere. From what I make, I have to pay for gas and maintenance every couple of months.
Money aside, to answer you question, yes I think driving people around can be enjoyable because you get to meet people from different walks of life. Some people want to talk and some don’t, it’s easy to tell when you ask them how they’re doing.
In the past 2 days I met some college kids from Oregon, a writer for a TV show on ABC, and a guy that just started his own fashion line for swimwear. I find that really interesting.

Quiet rides are fine with me, I usually have a playlist of songs that I normally listen to so I’m just singing along in my head haha.
I will say that I find it strange when a group enters my car and they all sit quietly, but I’ll start asking questions and the mood lightens up.

Pro tip: People love talking about themselves so ask them questions about themselves. Don’t get too personal though, just let them guide you on what they want to say. 
Ask about their jobs, trips, music, events, or plans for the future. Most people that I have encountered are extremely friendly. I have done 200 rides and I have never encountered someone that was rude or was in any way threatening.

Just always check their ratings, I will never accept anyone with a rating under 4.5 stars.

Feel free to message me if you have questions! Do not become a Lyft driver. They have lowered the rate of pay substantially and are keeping a huge percentage of each ride. Their responsibility is to maximize profits for their shareholders. They have begun treating their drivers like expenses. It’s sad that a company has resorted to such poor methods but it’s true. Look elsewhere. Your car gets eaten up. Easy 200 miles a day - city driving - oil changes - brakes - and with 30-90 people in out of your car, your seats start to wear out and puke in your car and people leaving trash and spilling food - fighting with people with no child seats - shall I continue ? pro of this job . work anytime you want.

cons to many to list .  but here are a few. wear your car out. less then min wage at times. risk you life  .

no benefits . risking getting into a crash.  higher insurance.  your better to deliver pizza jimmy johns  panera bread  these places your respected thanked . lyft uber drivers get spit on fuck the driver. no tip !! go get a real job loser .  first thing people ask .

Took my first lyft today,37,117.94688533066048,Lyft,"I am from Arizona visiting my family in Georgia. Today we were at a car repair shop, my brother, his girlfriend, and I had to get a lyft to pick up another vehicle since their car died right when we arrived to the shop. My brothers girlfriend ordered the lyft for us. When we got in, I realized the lyft driver had a male passenger/companion in the front seat. I immediately felt uncomfortable and the situation felt very sketchy. The companion reeked of alcohol and cigarettes. I felt like I had no choice to get in though because the lyft had already arrived and my brother insisted. The ride went fine, but I felt worried the whole time and glanced at directions to be sure they were be followed. Getting mugged and crime in that area is very common. I mentioned to my brother and his girlfriend afterwards who can be too trusting that their lyft drivers should not have companions riding with them as they’ve not had a background check and they should report it on their app, but they said maybe since she’s female driver she doesn’t like to ride alone, but it was daylight and that excuses the safety of the passengers. I have no way of reporting it since I did not order the lyft. I was only familiar with policies as I use uber often in Arizona. I know it sounds stupid, but no way for other passengers to report issues and I felt like getting in the lyft could have jeopardized our safety. Any advice next time on how to maybe explain this to the group I’m with and how to report it to lyft?","Sure it wasn’t a shared ride?

If your gut tells you no, go with your gut. I had a passenger this morning tell me the same thing happened to her. Upon further investigation, she realized she had accidentally opted for a shared ride. Is it possible that this is what happened?

If that's not what happened, it should be reported. It's against Lyft policy. I'm a female driver and I would never let a friend ride with me. If I felt that uncomfortable then I wouldn't do rideshare at all. So many things wrong with this whole post.

First of all, Lyft drivers DO have to pass a standard background check in order to have passengers in their vehicle. 

Secondly, it sounds like you should clarify what kind of ride your sister ordered, or maybe you shouldn’t use ride share in general if you’re that worried about your safety to where you second guess getting in a vehicle you requested to come get you. 

Most ride share drivers aren’t stupid enough to drive around while working with a personal passenger in the car. Not only is it uncomfortable for passengers but a violation that would result in driver termination.

Your Lyft driver was likely just doing his job more and giving a ride to someone who’s trying to avoid getting a DUI, which means the occasional person smelling of alcohol will get in their car. Get over it and move on. 

So crazy how people jump to conclusions and actively try to make some of these drivers lose their jobs. \# 1 rule..

if you dont feel safe pass on the ride. walk run whatever the situations requires . 

worry about getting another lyft  later.   your safe.    

its like people in a situation out of the car gun being held to them  there told  to get in.   do not get in scream yell for help run put of a fight . once your in that car your going somewhere private  not good. 1) you were probably in a shared ride.

2) what part of Georgia were you in? You think you feel uncomfortable, imagine picking up randoms strangers that dont have to pass a background check and may be drunk or high

&#x200B;

Also, you could have, you know....not gotten in.  got your own.

&#x200B;

I have heard of the female companion thing.  I even heard one had a dog. Whoa, first of all, learn to use paragraphs. 

But that’s not important, the most important thing is if you don’t feel comfortable getting in the car, don’t get in. No one will think twice if you feel like your safety is compromised.

Just apologize and say that you can’t leave right now and you have business to tend to. Leave a small tip if you feel guilty as tip and call another car. 

Sorry for your experience, but your safety is more important thank satisfying a driver. If you knew the rules why wouldn't you ask the driver wtf is up with the extra guy before getting in? You stated you took your ""first ride"" but you seem to have grasped the rules of protocol quickly. No matter how bad your area is, getting robbed will never be from a lyft or uber driver. it is their job, and they are very much exposed to everything they do.  Unless you get in the “wrong car” Then you are safe, worst thing might happen is you get a rude or a very rude driver, but no harm at all. also, picking his “companion” Rider will doubt cause any trouble too, because if the companion decided to do something, guess who’s getting arrested and fired from his job? The driver. so I doubt the drivers are that stupid to risk their job and life this much. Like I said, you might get trashy unprofessional drivers, but no harmful ones. but as I always say, trust your guts no matter who ever say, including me Decline the ride and tell the driver to cancel or if you have to youll file a complaint with lyft of the extra passenger.  He wont know you cant cancel and likely will himself rather than risk being deactivated. You should have declined on the basis of an unauthorized passenger and alcohol. You’re lucky to be alive.

If I had to say why I dislike lyft I would say it’s due to decreased pay and working harder to achieve a livable wage than most full time gigs. 


The company is supposed to support us but is not easy to reach and often the support is very lackluster. Pax have all the advantages when it comes to safety. 

Drivers are taking a big risk to make money off the app. having lyft not back them when drivers are the pawns doing the work to bring in the dollars that allows the app to be making money, feels bad and creates very low morale among drivers."

Had three tides tonight coming from areas that weren't even lit up high demand all that much.  Not one PPZ. Read the newspaper TODAY.  Both Lyft and Uber drivers are triggering surge pricing by turning off all apps when the big planes arrive at Reagan International IN PARTICULAR. It may be that surge was triggered on Lyft but not Uber.... the bonus in the red zone week increase to a certain max once youre inside it"
To Live and Die in LA,6,118.82623718254544,Lyft,Image,"If I drive during rush hr I don’t do it anywhere near the very high traffic areas. It’s not worth the hassle. In the end this 17 mile ride took ~1.75 hours and paid $25 best way  just stop driving 1 hour before rush hour.

i have been telling people to STOP  driving rush hour !  there is zero rush hour bonus !

WHY DO YOU CONTINUE TO DO IT ?????????????   STOP !! TURN YOUR APPS OFF !!! 

force a bonus .  lyft needs you more then you need them. [https://i.imgur.com/pfR2YCd.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/pfR2YCd.jpg)"
Any ideas on how to get a receipt if I cleaned it myself,8,118.8685751455084,Lyft,Image,"Go to a stationary shop/office max. Buy a receipt booklet. Write a receipt out. http://www.fakereceipt.us/sales_receipt.php i wrote my own . lyft said t was not good enough it has to be printed .   mine was for 15 dollars .they expect s to take it to a car wash detial shop that only charges 15 or 50 dollars there is none they  charge much more we all know this . Buy something and submit that receipt even if you just return it. Go to Microsoft WORD and find a template for a receipt. Create your own.

Dramatic reduction in rides this week,32,118.97752190477871,Lyft,"I live in Southern California. I have been driving for Lyft since 2016 and have given over 4,100 rides. I maintain a 5.0 rating. This week I have been getting far fewer calls than I usually get.

I have cleared the app cache, reinstalled the app, and even reset my phone, which is an LG v30 on the T-Mobile network. All software is up-to-date and Android is current.

I'm now at risk to not make my rent on my Express Drive car because of this precipitous decline in rides.

Has anyone else been experiencing this issue?","Ironically drivers who rent cars from the companies tend to stay a bit slower. I've been hearing the same complaints from drivers in my market while waiting at the airport same here in vegas I was told by a passenger to go apply for the taxi companies because they're clearly not dying and they make more money lol It's been slow everywhere.   Real bad School is ending for the summer. It always slows down a bit with the influx of teachers and college students returning to drive. If you work in tourist areas, things should start picking up again in a week or three. [Orange County this week](https://i.imgur.com/ttZmZxu.jpg)

I'm guessing it's the Express Drive that's killing you. Nothing lasts forever. It looks bleak. It would seem that a 50 % reduction in drivers would be the painful cure. TMFDs Market in maine has tanked this week. I like to think its due to eager/new drivers out in full mass 24/7. I just checked the android store and there was a update... that came out 3 days ago even though it just became available to me. Usually during that 2 -3 day window, this getting shitty. Drivers always seem to be around me and there are never surges. Since I've update, surges are more so but im too angry at lyft to do more after such a shitty start to the week. SoCal driver here. It has been kinda slow lately and whatever areas the app shows are busy, turn out to be an area that hands out a lot of short term rides before the big fish appears.

Hang in there, though; I'm in the same boat as you where I still haven't paid my rental but I plan on grinding like a madman these next few days to get what I can to keep my head above water while I start looking for another job. It's been messed up since the beggining of June.  I still only have a 16 % acceptance rate (because screw your no info giving ways Lyft) but the slowdown is on Uber side too. Been driving 12-14 hours a day, only to make what I used to make in 6-8 hours before. It’s the slow season. One day I was out for 8 hours and only made like 40 something, it’s terrible. i mean there could just be more drivers Gonna have to focus weekend nights hard from now on.Thursday night to Monday morning I’ve only been driving around 3.5 months and in express drive, but mostly LA areas. I’m already at 1800+ rides. I guess I am always hitting the 135 rides needed to get the rental mostly paid for, plus I feel like if I am not making $1000 in a week I am not driving or working hard enough."
"That's more like it Lyft, now you are accurately reflecting what a person can earn in a month before gas and expenses.",29,118.98148023812307,Lyft,Image,"[deleted] Every time a post like this comes up it makes me wonder about people. Lyft, Uber, and the rest were never marketed as a full-time job. In fact, when Uber first came out, it was touted as a side gig, like for giving rides on your commute to and from work. Looking at it like that, $800 a month for a part time job that lets you work when you want to isn’t that bad. Earning that would be the same as putting in 20hrs a week at $10 per hour at somewhere like Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Target, a local grocery store, etc. Lolol $200 a week. What a piece of shit u/Lyft That is an intelligent response and I appreciate it. I have to admit that I'm not watching flight times because I haven't been trying ever again to go back to an airport but I don't see this place having 25-minute wait times every time I've ever viewed it it's been full, the only time I ever did it I waited till 6 in the morning and daylight came out but I never even got a ride. Last question how do you view your ride's here I would have to accept the ride then say I started the ride to ever see the address otherwise I have to call the person hope they answer and ask him where they're headed to and how many people are getting in the car"
Changing cars,8,119.00513764554428,Lyft,"Hello all. Have a quick question, I have a 2007 corolla, car broke down, can I use my wife's car to do lyf without updating info? Or do have to update the car info in order to use my wife's car.
I'm in los angeles.","Some requirements vary by market. If yours is like mine, I would just be able to add the vehicle and upload the required documents. Other markets require inspections at a hub. Regardless, you wont have to do another driver background check or anything like that. No. Simply, no. 

Get your wife’s car cleared, but you just can’t show up in a different car. if you just show up in another car, youre going to get deactivated all sorts of quick.  think about it from the pax perspective.  they are expecting to see your, lets say white, 07 corolla, and you show up in a black mazda 3.  what does that look like to the pax?  if you want to use your wifes car, get the car inspected and and added to your account so its a legit car to drive around just wear the wifes car out you will be in the dog house for sure lol I had a friend who did lyft he swapped cars with his wife to do it but never registered his with lyft. Said he just always call and say he’s in wife’s car and what it looked like"
Bed bugs and customers,4,119.0071399603591,Lyft,So I was waiting for this to happen but finally got the most dreaded fare........customer left me a crawling surprise.  Found two in the back seat.  So now I’m down for the day and my car smells to unholy hell of chemicals.  Ffs.,"i have also had this happen with uber . i called bitched took pictures of the bugs i was paid 15 dollars .

best thing you can do .......         go to the store buy bed bug spray then vacuum it super clean.

let your car run for 2 hours in hot sun with the heat on max so it even gets hotter . this will kill these bed bugs.

your clothing before you go into your home strip down to your underwear throw those clothing into the trash do not wear them into the home!  all it takes is 1 egg and your infected in you home.

if you already wore your clothing into your home get the bed bug spray and hit the couch you sat on or so on throw those clothing directly into the dryer  will kill eggs and bugs.   dryer first do not wash  before you dry ."
When the time is up and the passenger is barely reaching the pin on map. I get the hell out of there with my $5 cancellation fee.,28,119.36058903444422,Lyft,Image,"I'll offer the same rebuttal I gave on OP's x-post:

Its the end of my night and I'm making my way home with Destination Mode on. I get a pickup at a college campus ~40 min from home. I arrive, wait, and with about a minute left on the clock, the pax texts ""almost there."" I respond, but the final minute goes by and there is still no pax.

I check my surroundings; it's night so I can't see too well down either sidewalk. They could be 20 feet away for all I know. I'm in no rush to go home and sleep, so against this community's general advice, I honor their text and wait a few more minutes.

No more than 3 minutes later, the pax arrives. He apologizes, he had forgotten something and sprinted back to retrieve it. Not my problem, but whatever. I forgive him and we set off for...my hometown, three minutes from my own destination. 40 mins of easy highway driving and conversing, and my night ends on a fantastic note.

I don't mean to invalidate OP's reaction, I do it too. I just hope we don't ignore the alternative completely, regardless of the particular circumstances. Your patience might just make someone's day, and boost your night. And then we have those pax who won't budge an inch, even though they see you a few yards ahead on a one-way street and won't walk to your car. I cancel and take the loss, because I don't get paid to drive another five minutes to get back to them. Pax seem to think technology can find their exact location. No. I enjoy that this is why I call ya'll when I'm already outside.  I look terrible running, and I'd probably fall...lol. I had a lady get mad when i denied her ride due to not have car seats for the children.  I waited the timer out to collect my fee and she walked back over to tell me to leave.  LOL I guess she owned the whole street. Hah! I did this once. Pulled away when the rider was making out saying goodbye. Next to my car. Idk if you're my pax or not. You didn't say anything. So I drove off. 

Or cancel on people and stay in the same parking spot and don't let them in when they show up. I love it when they try to run to your car waving and yelling. Sorry boo should’ve hustled 5 minutes ago. I have NO issue doing it because I’m in a college town so every ride is a minimum fare ride which means cancellations are more profitable. 

One time there was this guy who thought he could stand outside and smoke for 4 minutes and 50 seconds while I waited. LOL he was very wrong. 

Another time I now showed a ride and then saw the person running to my car from down the street. I stopped, let them run almost all the way to my car and then drove off.

Yep. I’m petty. You should probably find another job"

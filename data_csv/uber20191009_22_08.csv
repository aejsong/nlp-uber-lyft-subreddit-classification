Is it mandatory for all Uber vehicles to have busted-ass suspensions?,2,0.12971349276878216,uber,Jesus people. Basic maintenance.,"It's called sporty suspension. You feel the road rather than sitting on Grandma's crouch. Order an UberSelect or Uber Black next time. Lol these poor drivers do not make any real money in most markets. Next time order a limo. Suspensions cost a ton.

And uber doesnt pay enough in a lot of markets.

"Creating new account, I've never used Uber, but says account is disabled ?",0,0.2062296964918022,uber,"Next week I'm traveling for work, and it was suggested that I use Uber to get around as I just need to make it between the airport and conference hotel then to dinner if I go out.  I've never used an Uber, so I downloaded and started setting up the app.  Well after entering my email it said my account is disabled with a link to visit.  I went to the link, and it's asking for my last two Uber trips ... But I've never used it.  Does Uber not validate email addresses?  So could someone have used my email to create an account in the past? I don't keep old emails, but I don't remember ever getting any emails from Uber.  

I filled out the form with "" never used Uber"" when it asked for last two trips.  It said someone would call me but that was an hour ago and still no call.  I'll try to find a support number later this evening if one exists. 

Anyone seen this before ?  Not getting a warm fuzzy to use the service if this can't be resolved soon .

Thanks...","Quick update .. no word from Uber yet, but when I visit their site and attempt to log in using Google I get this:

>No Uber account is associated with this Google account.

Uber driver had a full on Brita filter in his car,29,0.2278153446509882,uber,Image,"Exactly what I need. Lotion and magazines. Some paper towels hand sanitizer and fresh water. You do the math. No coffee maker - 1 star So you got a ride in his home? This is one of the few instances that I’d cancel the ride. I wouldn’t feel comfortable. WTH. What country is this Uber from? I'd rather ride in a non-cluttered car. This motherfucker done lost his goddamn mind another charity driver donating his tips to pax, cringe No Sodastream? Super unsafe and an instant 1 star No Blu-ray movies on for my 3 minute ride? 1-star!!! This would make me feel claustrophobic Lol this is overboard. I couldn't imagine having that in my car. I wouldn’t trust that...  I would probably give this person a 1 or 2* for how gross this looks That would wig me the fuck out. I’d love it if those magazines were American Way, Hemispheres, Sky, etc. Lol! Throw in duty-free shopping and this driver gets 5* from me.

Seriously, though, wtf... Potential borderline mental illness? He's trying real hard, I hope he gets some decent tips. I wouldn't go that far but I'm not a full timer, respect his hustle though. Is 311 a thing? Bottled water is wayyyy over rated... Nothing like all that crap smashed into your skull as soon as he gets rear-ended. Way overboard, trying to over achieve, and will probably feel stupid when he gets deactivated after a couple asshole pax 1-star him or make unfounded, uninvestigated complaints.

Don't waste money on pax who just don't care. This is no more likely to get you a 5 star than just keeping a clean car and being polite. Is...is that... is that a mobil jerk station on these right there? Damn,  no shame in that game!"
What is the point of the website for Uber?,5,0.4608014557758967,uber,"Honestly, what in the world is the point of having the website being able to call rides for Uber if you're just going to ask me for a verification code from my phone?  


The whole point of using the website is due to, in case your phone is dead, or your phone is missing.

Trouble getting drivers to fill out a survey,7,0.593833863194342,uber,"I’ve been trying to get Uber drivers online to fill out a survey for a project I’m working on. However it’s been rather difficult finding them. So I’m considering ordering cheap rides with drivers around my city and then offering them a cash tip if they fill out my survey at the end of the ride. 
Do any of you think this would work? Or, do you have any better ideas? The survey takes about 3-4 minutes to complete. Thanks for the help!","Online survey? 

Why dont you post the website here and let us do the survey? 

Also there are groups and forum for drivers in Facebook ! For each cities in USA People generally don’t like to do surveys, but your idea of taking cheap trips and tipping so they are incentivized is good.  You’ll probably have to tip in advance or they might not believe you will, although I’d expect some may avoid or forget about the survey even after you tip. Maybe create an online survey and give them a business card or something with a link. Or ask your questions during the ride.

"Driver route charged extra, Uber promised refund and is charging the amount AGAIN!!",2,0.7023755298720465,uber,"Destination was south and there were 4 possible was to reach it, its a commonly visited destination for over a year no problem. Recent driver took a north route and it was heavily trafficked to the point where we were stuck in the same 2 mile section for 25 minutes. This was also ignoring Uber's chosen path and uber's re-routes. I told the driver to turn around and reached mu destination very late and charged almost double the estimated amount. 

I reported the issue with uber and to my honest surprise as i was not expecting or demanding it, i was told the difference would be refunded. 2 days later the difference is being charged to my account again. I have no idea how to continue handling rhe issue as there seems to be no option for this issue on the app.","If you have any communications with Uber, I would document it, and send it to Customer Support referencing your previous conversation and tell them that it is unacceptable that you have been recharged the difference. Do you have a text message documentation of the rep telling you there'd be a refund. If so take it up with Uber. If that still does not work you can always do a chargeback but be prepared. Uber can be a bitch-ass company and they may block you from using the service for that.  


I once had an Uber Eats driver only deliver half of my food order. Had them on my ring door camera telling me that was all the food the restaurant provided when I asked where the rest of it was. Sent the video to Uber and they still refused a refund because the missing items were in a ""combo"" and part of the combo was there, but not all of it. I ended up doing a chargeback and had my account cancelled. Just as well, I never intended to do business with them again after that, but still, a bitch-ass thing to do when you're presented with video evidence and you still say ""fuck the customer"""

"Getting Uber in a rough neighborhood, can I ask my driver this favor?",30,0.8530584002672522,uber,"I recently moved to West Oakland and it seems like a rough area. I'm a petite woman and concerned about my safety being out at night. If I have an Uber dropping me off late night, can I tip him/her a few dollars and ask to wait until I'm inside my home?","I've had plenty of women just ask if I can wait until they are inside, when dropping them off late at night, I generally do it out of courtesy even If they don't ask and sometimes I wonder if they think I am creepy for doing that. answer to your question - most of us don't mind making sure you get through the door - so long as it is brief enough we don't raise concerns or disturb your neighbors by doing so. If you have to jump a fence and deal with the neighbors dog it can get unruly but we roll with it. a smile and an uber sign can get you out of just about anything - as long as you are legit.

&#x200B;

it's a comfort thing (on their part) there have been so many issues in the media with drivers doing stoopid stuff , many female pax prefer not to be dropped right on their doorstep, especially late at night - let alone having you 'hang around' observing them - without express permission and invitation. 

the younger ones tend to be amazingly dismissive and nonchalant about the crappiness of their hood (they live there, after all) but if they are older and are peering around the car and appear unsure or concerned I'll speak up - are you sure this is your block/ building/ door/ driveway? do you want me to wait just a minute until you go through the door and close it?

&#x200B;

If it's really dark and sketchy - I'll pull in so my headlights illuminate the area around the door when someone might hide - or I have a bright hand flash. Drivers should be aware of this. It’s just a decent thing to do. I have no problem doing this if a lady asks. I used to do it as a matter of principle but I stopped. I realised one night that the passenger I just dropped off was hesitating going to her front door because she did not want me to see which apartment she lived in. Uber/Lyft drivers get enough bad press as it is. I don't want to creep anyone out. If I was your driver, I'd have no problem doing that if you let me know.  I'm a nice guy, so I wouldn't even expect a tip, but that will definitely sweeten the deal for some drivers. I'm always willing to do this. I do it with male passengers and female passengers. The funny thing is with Millennials, just to generalize, a bunch of them get offended if you do it. Especially if they're young girl they just think you're being a creeper. I would not mind if anyone asks. Don’t offer to tip extra to stay unless you see that they have another rider already in cue or if it takes you a long time to actually get inside. 
If you wanna give a tip go ahead but don’t make it part of the bargain. 
Don’t buy chivalry. The recent driver training said that offering to wait for people to get inside their homes is a no no. Good idea...., but some drivers are stupid, lack social skills, and can't speak English, so it's kind of a gamble on whether or not they'd actually do it. I don’t live in a rough neighborhood and even during the day, I have male/female drivers wait without me asking. They don’t mind! If the passenger asks I will, otherwise I don't want to be a creep I have no problem waiting. Just hope it’s a min or so wait vs 3-4 mins. 

The question I have is, what do you think I’m doing if two armed gunman pop out of the bushes? 

If you want me to describe the murderers to the first cops I can find, great. But if you think I’m getting out of the car, you gotta big surprise coming. Cash upfront no less than 10 bucks you can ask for what ever you want sweetie ;)"
Will an Uber pick me up from the Harrisburg PA Amtrak Station?,5,1.1093778447227345,uber,"Hey, I’m having trouble scheduling a pickup from the Harrisburg Amtrak station. Is anyone familiar with this area?",no https://www.uber.com/drive/harrisburg/places/train-station/
Has uber ever toggled on options you had off?,10,1.1353500669449568,uber,"So I just got an Ubereats request and I've had Uber eats toggled off for almost a year.

 I have found that it's not worth it to do eats in my market so I don't. Uber in its infinite wisdom decided to toggle it on and the give me a request.

 Now normally that wouldn't bother me I would just decline it which I did. but now that there is a pro program in my area I have take keep my stats at a certain level and declining orders because of their bs it's no ok.

My acceptance took a dip thx uber","Happened today! I always keep eats turned off and all of sudden I get bombarded with food delivering request. Fucked my cancel rate straight up.  Why they do dat like that? Because I've heard other people in these subs say this happens, I always check my settings before I start driving. I'll even toggle Eats on, save the settings, and then toggle it off. Just to be sure. Same thing happened to me. Got 4 delivery requests one right after the other and declined them all. Delivery had been off for 6 months and was off when I checked it after . Then Uber made it so I had to close the “message “ banner twice each time I open the app . The message tells me I am in danger of losing my “gold status “ because of a high decline rate. Only requests I have declined in months were those delivery requests. I came to the conclusion that it’s a scam to make us scramble. They want to make sure we are always worried about keeping our current status. It had to opposite effect on me since now I know they will take an earned status away at will and I have absolutely no recourse . Yeah, it seems to pop back on for me once a month-ish Yes, in Dallas there are areas that turn on UberX when I set it to Select only, and sometimes it just refuses to load the options page to let me turn X off. I called support and removed eats alltogether. Every time I cross into a new county it activates UberX for me, and I always seem to forget until I take a few rides and start seeing $3 and $5 tips."
Traveling with a child that requires a car seat question..,27,1.169933400289328,uber,So I’ll be with my wife and son who still requires a car seat.

Uber in big cities,6,1.235951918821644,uber,I am just curious about this. How much do regular Uber drivers make in places like NYC or Chicago? Thanks! :),"Chicago can make you 200$ a work day most of the year, but I also know a guy who makes 300$ a day consistently on UberX. He works like a mad man though, maxing out the 10 hour limit. NYC is its own deal and is more like a taxi. Do it as a extra job , there are no benefits and takes toll for your car 

I’ve been doing this for a year and clocked in 60k miles 
And kept all record for maintenance , and parts and labor for the car and also gas intake 

I prob makes around 400-1500 weekly , kept 20% for tax , and maybe around 100-300 for gas weekly i just did 19 hours in lyft and made $127, before deducting for gas. (Los Angeles) I work in nyc and I would say drivers avg $20-$25 an hour on slow days. But the city is full of random trips so we will get lucky days and make 200 in 4 hours sometimes with airport and out of town trips. My best day was 300 in 7 hours I work in DFW metroplex in Texas, I average $15-20/hr when I run. I only run maybe 2 days a week, but I'll do around 20-30 hours in those days. Maybe a night shift if I'm feeling froggy"
How long for approval?,3,1.2776996040151076,uber,"I am about to start driving for Uber. I sent in everything about a week ago and I still have not been approved. It just says ""Getting account ready.

For the love of god please stop accepting trips while you’re still completing a trip,22,1.288579233655775,uber,"Time and time again I request a ride and I see tons of cars around and my request always gets scooped up by someone whose always in the middle of a trip instead of any other drivers who are just sitting around waiting. 

As a result of some greedy driver, I have to wait even longer for a ride than I normally would. It’s incredibly inconvenient.

What’s worse is that they’re usually doing a trip in the opposite direction and still accept it. Like can y’all please stop that? It’s super annoying, like even more than y’all trying to have a conversation with me when I clearly have my headphones in.","If we don't accept it it counts as a decline for our numbers, which affects our earnings potential and driver rewards.

It's not fair to you, perhaps, but the system is set up (and intentionally) to force drivers to fight for every ride. We can’t help what the app offers us... and we can’t know where or how many other drivers are available anyway. This isn’t really something drivers can fix for you. Drivers don't get offered trips when there are other cars available.  I get maybe one queued ride per night in the slower market I'm in.  The algorithm tries to match you with the quickest available driver, and it's quite likely that when all the cars are in use the app starts showing you cars that will be available soon so it doesn't look like a wasteland when you open it. Yea this is a really dumb suggestion. Seems like you're problem is with the algorithm, not with the drivers trying to optimize earnings.

Get over yourself. Not sure if OP is just kidding. Do you know what your rating is? Sounds like drivers are declining your rides for some reason. You can’t know for sure that other drivers are just ‘sitting around’. I’m not going to get kicked offline just because I might offend someone that I can’t transport IMMEDIATELY to. Uber pings the closest driver to you, and if they don’t accept you (or, another thing you won’t know, don’t get pinged for you in the first place because they’re already stacked) then you might want to work on that attitude and raise your own rating. I’m going to accept whatever comes through because I’m working. If you want to complain about people doing their job, then transport yourself, request a ride sooner or schedule a ride. If they don’t accept you while they’re in the middle of one, you’d have to wait an additional half hour or more, your highness. Get a taxi then and see how long you have to wait

Driver have to accept the ride being offered to them , otherwise it will goes to their cancelation rate , high cancelation rate means the driver will have less perks and rewards and goes toward their ability to drive 

There is always uber select and lux that you can request , it will cost you more $ , but if you value your time as much then it is for you See how long it takes for a cab to get to you. 

Resolved. 1. If you have the intelligence to know that the driver is already on a trip, why don't you have the intelligence to cancel it until you get one of the drivers sitting around?

2. Try borrowing your grandma's hearing aid as a sign. You are tripping so hard and obviously know nothing. Uneducated people like you should walk instead. Let's see how you like it, imbecile. Just so you know, the cars on the app before you book a ride are not real Uber cars, they are representative of the density of cars around you. They have to. Uber punishes drivers for not accepting rides. If we're on a quest we can't simply decline your trip because we lose our streak. I'm not giving up money just because it's inconvenient for some pax. Stop your trolling!! Agree with all of the above"
UberPool?,13,1.4728847892113306,uber,So I’ve been driving a handful of months and just found out what UberPool is. Does this still even exist and why was I not automatically able to have that driving option?,"[deleted] It depends on market. It is not in my market. If it was, my acceptance rate would plunge like today's stock market. Pool is a terrible idea and experience from a driver's stand point - you're not getting the same you would make off two different X or XL requests, but you take pretty much the same amount of time unless those people are getting dropped close by each other.   


They could tweak it so that different passengers in a group could split the fare, and charge a premium (and PAY a premium) for that type of service. You like driving pool? 
What kind of car you have ? 
Normally your car model and year determined the class of uber .

There’s uber pool/X/XL/select/lux/black/wav 

Most car eligible for pool and x Uber Pool isn't available in all markets. It may not be an option where you drive. But if you are active for Uber X, if you enter an area that offers Uber Pool, you'll start seeing Pool trips too.

For this time, just contact support and I think they should be able to help you out with this! In India? Scammed? I’m surprised They do cash where you are? Well that's silly and just asking for problems like this. Why does Uber allow the driver to make that claim after you leave? If you didn't pay him enough, he should do what a regular cab driver would do if you ran without paying, which is chase you down, call the police, etc. So stupid that they let him harass a customer even if he paid. Interesting, about $3.20 US. What was the distance on your trip? Take pic of you paying Email a copy of your receipt to Uber and problem solved. How much in USD? $5? Why are you paying cash?

My uber eats/Uber account got disabled,4,2.7157898818756694,uber,"So my Uber eats account got disabled two months ago because I had registered a complaint that I found hair in my food - for which Uber decided to compensate me fully. Next thing I see is that they have disabled my account because I had “breached their community guidelines”. I wrote Uber eats an email telling that this is highly unethical in that they’re basically telling consumers to not complain over shoddy food safety practices. Anywho - they tell me that I need to send them an email saying “I accept the community guidelines” without which they will not be able to re-activate my account - which I do because I am PhD student and I depend desperately on food delivery some days. However, they did not reactivate my account and despite me asking them many times (on twitter support) they keep sending me the same auto generated message about how they have sent me an email following up (which they haven’t). I am just about to give up with them, I was wondering if any of you had any tips to offer. 
P.S I am based in Australia",Make a new account with a google voice number. It’s very easy. Hmm I don’t think that’s how uber accounts work  in Australia.... but thanks! Use another service. I don't understand how people will complain about a company and then continue to use them.
How long before self driving cars take over?,8,2.8659634929978184,uber,What are your predictions folks! I day 6 years and major of uber will be AI on wheels,"This is a sore topic. Damn death machines. I think it’s going to take generational acceptance before it really takes over.

There will be a long period where both driver and driverless cars are on the road and people will have an option to choose.

Once a generation is born into it and feels that it is normal, it will take over completely.

5-10 years before its integrated and partially accepted, 15 - 30 years before there are no more cars with human drivers. 10-15 years in selected cities 

AI for the autonomous car are ready and in testing phase .

In order a fully autonomous uber/lyft/trucks to take it place in say New York City, the whole city have to be adapt and revolve around the AI configuration, rfid chips need to be in place all over the city, along with the bike route/parking/tunnels/bridges/park area/home and apartment complexes.

That alone will take years , perhaps decade , it’s like mapping the road for auto car to detect and make its decision. Here in Austin Texas , the interstate highway still in construction and won’t be finished til 2024, by then we probably need more roads and patches and more construction in the developing area .

Unless they will build a city around the auto car right away , jobs for now still safe in major cities and growing cities 

But by 2050 everything should be in place and we should be right on schedule to have star trek style exploration system and economy Don't you mean Self-Driving Toilets? In 10 years, all companies will be self driving for any kind of public transportation as insurance for non-self driving public transportation vehicles will be way more expensive.   Self driving will be safer.  

In 20 years, every cars sold will be capable of self driving.     
In 40 years, cars wont be sold with a steering wheel anymore. Lyft already has those autonomous cars roaming vegas for months now. 

It will be sooner , make sure you have an exit plan now when you still have time."
What is a good temperature to maintain in the car?,6,2.8672019189375417,uber,To keep customers happy,"69° C I tend to try and do opposites to outdoor weather.

If it's hot out, I keep it cool but not cold.

If it's cold out I keep it warm but not hot.

If it's warm and comfortable out I crack the windows and leave the sunroof open.  No air on.

I've had no comments or complaints about the interior temperature.  Passengers also insist I keep the sunroof open on good days after I give them the choice of open or closed. Summer 72 winter 78 on auto.

Grocery pickup with Uber?,14,2.9212412708004316,uber,"I had scheduled my usual grocery pickup from my local grocery store for tomorrow evening. The type where you park in a spot and wait for a grocery employee to come outside and load your groceries in the car and go home. However, I forgot my S.O. has a meeting tomorrow out of town and won’t be back at the time I requested for pick up. He is using our only car to get there. Before I call to cancel, would it be strange to use an Uber for this? It would basically be drive there, wait for groceries to be loaded and drive back home. I’d like to not have to cancel this as I literally only have a carton of eggs in my fridge haha. Any advise is appreciated!","Not unheard of... i would call the Uber and then call the driver immediately to explain what you’re asking for. Some will be game, some won’t. Definitely tip well! Tip well and most drivers will be amenable.

Never say “I’ll tip you in the app” and then don’t. Karma is horrific towards those people. I have done this once before, just not groceries.

Host of a party already had too much to drink before guests arrived and needed to pick up trays of catered food.

I pick him up at his house, go to the 1st stop to load my trunk with food, and return to their house after.

My car smelt like chicken parm for a bit after, but it was fine.  Make sure it is 1st stop at grocery store and 2nd stop back home so the driver is in full knowledge of the route. You could always get an uber there, let that driver go, and call a new uber when you have all the groceries ready to go. If the store has curbside, they almost certainly have delivery. It would be cheaper, faster, and easier to just switch the order to delivery through the store or cancel the order and use Shipt or Instacart to order.

If you ask on here you can get a promo code that will get you a free or discounted delivery. PM me if you want one.

As for Ubering there to pick up, it's irritating to be asked to make short trips with stops and wait times because they are unprofitable so be sure to mention a cash tip when you're asking if it's OK. Just add two stops to the ride. This is very common for people to do. They have InstaCart for that. >Before I call to cancel, would it be strange to use an Uber for this? It would basically be drive there, wait for groceries to be loaded and drive back home

I would get an Uber there as a one way journey and ask the driver if he minds waiting and then take you back. Mention that you'll tip and if he is OK with it  then you add a new destination to your current journey.  Most drivers don't mind things like this as long as they're given an option. As an Uber driver hell no , that's because those curbside services take to long almost 10 to 15 minutes to acknowledge you and load you up, we get paid shit for non moving time ..use instacart.. Just make a two stop trip.  It isn't like driver is performing a miracle.  Everybody gets the 2 stop trips to the store. Just remember we get 10 cents a minute when we're sitting."

It all depends which market you are in as well people out here in ottawa people  are so stingy with money only 1 out of 8 people tip!

It sounds like you're using a debit card, and that Uber did a temporary charge to your account as you booked each ride.  These charges should fall off of your account in 1 to 8 days, depending on your bank. Do not use a debit card for Uber. They are not trustworthy. If you don't have a credit card, get one you can load so you can chargeback and/or limit the damage they can cause.

As for you're current charges, those are holds and they will drop off...eventually. Just wait for the outcome if any. Mabey SO DID YOU EVER GET YOUR PENDING CHARGES AUTOMATICALLY REFUNDED?

Rider rating not changing?,9,4.435998215335938,uber,"I’m trying to boost my rider rating from 4.78. When I first started using Uber, I didn’t realize things like canceling a ride (if I’m not ready) would affect ratings. Since then I’ve made sure to be as courteous as possible. Friendly, not asking for extra things, not slamming doors, etc. This past week I took 4 rides, but strangely my rating didn’t budge. Did this mean none of the drivers rated me at all? I don’t understand how it didn’t go up or down by even .01. Any ideas?","It takes about a week from the date of the ride for the rating to actually change your overall rating. For drivers we get averaged out of our 500 trips 

I’m not sure how many for riders First, you are only rated when your trip is completed. Thus, cancelling a ride has no effect on your rating. 

Second, drivers MUST rate all passengers at the end of the trip. They have to rate in order to close out the current trip and accept/begin the next. 

Third, there is a delay of several days in updating your rider rating. This is to prevent retaliatory ratings should a driver give you a poor rating. 
Give it a few more days and you should see movement in your rating. 
Thanks for being a conscientious rider. (Cash tips, even just a couple of bucks, can go a long way to quickly raising your rating too!) Your rating doesn't go up until the below5star ratings you received get cycled out. For drivers it is last 500 ratings. If I get a 5 star today that lowers my rating by 0.008. So a 4.85 goes down to a 4.842 (or just 4.84 as Uber rounds to the nearest).

After 300 people give me all 5 stars, that 1 star still ahs 200 more ratings to go before it finally disappears & my rating can go back up to 4.85. 

Point is, I would guess yrs is similar. Even if ur getting all 5s nowadays, you have to wait for the lower ratings to cycle out.

&#x200B;

If you have 4.776, You'd still see a 4.78 rating, but you'd need to rise a full 0.01 to see 4.79, which is 5 out of 2500 (if riders are on a last 500 ratings system like us). Replacing a cycled out 1 star with a 5 star only adds 4 to yr total/2500. Or 0.008. Raises a 4.776 to a 4.784. So it's easy to go downward right away. Every 1 star rating lowers our rating by 1. (.8 really, but it appears as a full pt 4.78 to 4.77). But to raise it you have to wait for an old sub5 rating to cycle out while getting perfect 5s in the meantime.

Hidden Fees,5,4.492965807953367,uber,"I was charged 6$ extra, including a ""booking fee"" and a ""base fare"" fee in addition to a ""time"" and ""distance"" fee.   


I've tried to contact uber, the app just claims that it upholds the fare, and I cannot find a contact number, the emergency number just gives a message but doesn't let me talk to anyone.   


any help?","This is the normal charge for everyone,  go to the uber drivers reddit to see what gets taken from the drivers. The booking fee is on every ride for everyone.  Mine is always $2.35.  In NJ you can add the fifty cent state surcharge to the ride as well.  

Time is what you are charged while you are sitting in traffic or going 2 miles an hour. Distance is while the vehicle is actually moving, not rolling ahead 5 feet because the turnpike is at a standstill.  That's the time charge.  Basically, your quoted fare can change if you get in the car for a 15 min ride and then spend 45 minutes stuck in traffic or crawling onto an exit ramp behind 200 other cars and 12 minutes in actual motion to your destination. 

Unless I am using my platinum fixed fare between home & office or on a trip with zero traffic or delays, it's broken out into base fare, time, distance, tolls, booking fee and state surcharge. That's the platform variation for everyone, excluding wait time or other singular state based fees.   

If there is a difference between your quoted fee and what you were actually charged you can ask for a fare review.  That only works if your driver ignored GPS and took the long way or managed to get lost or took a significant wrong turn (not a block or two).  If this isn't what happened and you had road delays, your fare stands. Cough cough 60-80% sometimes Both fees are disclosed and have been there for years.

Report an uber I didn’t order (but did ride in),6,5.024285252408848,uber,How to I report a driver for being high while driving. I dont even know if it is possible as I wasnt the one who ordered the uber another person in the group did. Thank you in advance,"Account holder can do it. They should have done it rt away when you guys stopped the ride to get out for yr safety. As we assume u did. Since the driver was so clearly impaired that ur comfortable worrying about reporting them now in yr free time, u most likely didn't want to continue riding in a car driven by this person.

 I've never been impaired [I swear there is a point to the following]. & I drive very seriously cuz I've seen plenty of road tragedy & my economic situation makes  a collision really troublesome. I have over 5 years driving San Francisco streets without a collision.

 Yet I've had at least 3 impaired driving reports. One being my first ride of the day, at 1pm, a flawless little cruise 20 miles down the freeway. Dude said thank you at the end, I said hav a gud day. Then a $9 ride that got a $10 tip(!!!). Report notification came in shortly after starting 3rd trip. So probably 1st rider. He did have an exceptionally low rating though, sooo,  whatever that's worth.....I shoulda known better....maybe?

I haven't a clue why I got any of them, & I only got 48hr timeouts while they ""investigate"". I didn't get to make any money, & it's not like the 2 days were days I'd planned for taking off. That time from above I happened to be by their help center when I got taken offline, so I went inside to show off my sobriety. It didn't make a difference. 

So I have the at least 3 reports on my record. Less than one per year tho, so I guess that was considered in my favor as they know people make false reports. It's scary nonetheless cuz Uber dgaf about us. 2 of them came in the same year. Maybe even half a year but I don't remember for sure.

It's funny, in San Francisco I bet most of these drivers that do ridiculous driving that endangers those around them, are probably sober but tired from being in a car all day. & with little money netted for it, coupled with the knowlege that most people won't even tip a $1, they have little motivation to counter the tiredness. 

Then they get to worry about who might leave one of the ""serious"" reports. How do you know he was""high""? Special training? Quit being a bitch we're all high"

I tried to cancel after 20 minutes, but then he accepted the fare again and moved to a parking lot, where he didn't move for another 25 minutes. I didn't want to face potentially two cancellation fees so I gave up. He just sat there ignoring my phone calls. At one point, I even left a voicemail asking him to cancel the ride. It was just some redneck guy with an extreme southern accent, so I wasn't expecting the best outcome. Somehow he had a 5.0 rating. 

I ended up downloading Lyft and getting home using them instead. Never taking Uber again after that bullshit. I'd like to file a complaint against the driver and receive refunds for the two cancellation fees. I guess if that's impossible, I'll have to go to my bank and request they remove the charges.","You don't know how to Uber. He just doesn't want to go there and wants you to cancel. The 2nd time you can cancel within 2 min without charge. If he's not moving to you in reasonable you can cancel for him not making progress. You should not be charged but screenshot everything just in case. And if he doesn't turn up within ETA you can certainly cancel without charge. if you cancel within 2 minutes you dont get the cancel fee. next time cancel within 2 minutes and wait like 5 to order another and hopefully the camper will have moved along. Dispute it , contact help during ride , and say that you aren’t inside the car , your phone gps and driver should be within vicinity , and Uber can determine it You can let their support know through the “Help” section in the app. If you contact Uber within the app you can get your refund. Its Austin City Limits and traffic is whack. Add to that the fact the passengers dont care that uber and lyft take 60% of the fare and 90% of passengers never tip. This means short rides cost drivers money. This is the future of rideshare. Dispute it with Uber. I’ve had the same thing happen to me and they refunded me the 5 dollar fee. He probably sensed you were a racist & decided to make you miserable. And predictably, racist wasn't smart enuff to know that when he got the same driver, to just cancel right away & get a different driver.

The south, like any place with accents (that's everywhere, everyone has an accent) has all sorts of people. Lots of them are great. So hearing an accent tells you nothing.

While I appreciated the constant updates of him getting my food, but that was a bit much. Especially when I have to pre-tip in the app.... Well of course nobody is going to *ask* for a tip since thats a douchey move. Generally speaking the tip is to reward quality service. Was the driver fast? Was the food hot? Was it neatly packed? If so then that deserves a tip, because the driver could have taken his sweet time, let the bag fall over the place making a mess, and given it to you room temperature. I use Uber regularly.

LAX Leads Airport Stand Against Uber and Lyft Congestion – Skift,3,6.087873215440799,uber,Image,"I'll think twice about ordering a rideshare car if it involves a shuttle... That sucks LAX should invest in an interior terminal tram system such as this one: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExpressTram

Also, for people going into the parking garages, build bridges or tunnels instead of the crosswalks that stops traffic.

A lot of the traffic are due to the damn shuttles as well. You have a few shuttles from every rental company, a few from all the off airport parking garages, then you have ones that take people around the terminals. The main problem with them is that a lot of times, they only have a few people in them, because there are so many shuttles.

The tram can take them to an area where only shuttles can go. This would free up a lot of traffic as well.

Ride share don’t really jam up traffic... we pick them up or drop off, then we leave. Shuttles often wait for more passengers and they take up a lot of space and are slow.

Could someone breakdown the process of picking up an Uber/Uber Pool passenger? 

From what I remember from taking pool rides, when a rider matches with the driver, the driver gets a notification. He is then automatically routed to pick up the passenger. When the driver arrives, they press a button on the app that notifies the rider that they've arrived. Once the rider's picked up, they click a button (or is it sliding a slider, I can't remember) and drive off to drop off the rider. 

\^ Is that correct?

HELP! I am being overcharged for every Uber ride since I started using PayPal as my method of payment. 99.99% sure Uber is the culprit.,3,6.383810715476671,uber,"Since the beginning of this year, I stopped using my credit card to pay for Uber rides and instead opted to use PayPal. 

I made this decision because I didn’t want to share my credit card details with Uber anymore. 

So when my old credit card expired and I got a new one, instead of adding it directly on Uber, I added it on PayPal, and started paying for all my Uber rides via PayPal which uses the very same credit card. 

Little did I know that the charges  shown on my Uber receipts, and the ones shown on my bank account did not match. I was being charged more, and I only realized this just now, 10 months later! I use Uber at least twice a week!

How do I contact Uber for a refund? 

For every ride, I am being charged a little bit more on my bank account, than the amount shown in my Uber receipts, which makes zero sense.

At first I thought it was PayPal charging me a fee for the transaction but it doesn’t appear to be the case. 

First, it’s my understanding that when it comes to business transactions with PayPal,  it’s always the receiver who gets charged for a payment not the sender. 

I use PayPal to pay for lots of online services and the amount shown on my receipt always corresponds to the amount taken from my bank account / credit card via PayPal. 


I don’t live in the US, and I don’t have a US PayPal account. However for some inexplicable reason, even though Uber rates in the country I live are in its local currency, Uber charges on my NON US PayPal account are shown in US Dollars.   

Nevertheless, when I convert the amount PayPal shows for my Uber transactions  in USD to the local currency of the country I live in,  it corresponds more less exactly to the fee on my Uber receipt.  The difference is negligible, less than 0.5 cents. 

Whereas the difference between the charge on my bank statement vs the amount on the Uber receipt is considerable. 

So I don’t understand why I am being overcharged for every ride because I choose to pay with  PayPal. I spoke to my bank and they assured me that that they are  not the ones overcharging me either. 

I checked all Uber transactions on my bank statements from before and after I started using PayPal, and compared them to their corresponding Uber receipts.  

All the transactions from before I started using PayPal match exactly the amount shown on my Uber receipts. All transactions after I started using PayPal do not match the Uber receipts. The amounts are always higher. 

The culprit is either Uber, PayPal or my bank, and based on my investigation so far it looks like it’s Uber. 

Has anyone experienced this issue? Especially anyone outside of the US?

I probably had 100+rides since January and I have been overcharged for all of them. I am so pissed and want to get to the bottom of this.

How do I contact Uber for a refund?","You should dispute the transaction with PayPal. They will investigate, you send them proof of the charge from your Uber receipts, and they should issue you with a refund of the over charge. The PayPal buyer protection policy holds more info.

what happens between customers putting in locations and drivers getting them?,8,6.459910252513709,uber,"(this is a legitimate question, not a passive aggressive complaint against uber drivers going to the wrong pick up) 

I've had a bunch of occasions where I put in a location and the uber driver will seemingly have been given a different place to go - not super far away, but explicitly a different location. say I pin myself at a particular restaurant, and my uber driver will call me from a nearish-by gym that's close on the map but like a good few minutes walk away, and be very confused that I wanted picking up from Restaurant, and not Gym

what actually happens at the driver end when I put my pin at This Restaurant On This Road? does it just pick up the road name? or the post code? or the approximate GPS of that pin? like I'm making good faith assumptions here that the drivers aren't going to the wrong place on purpose! I just don't get how this happens from an app UI point of view","Simple explanation is this, a building is mostly square with 4 corners , by default uber will guide the driver to that closest corner with the shortest distance 

So it could be on any 4 corners  , now if it’s a major building downtown with 4 corners , intersections, sometimes one way street , with many business located next to each other and heavy traffic and bad gps connection, are you getting this ? 

If you type in say 300 congress in downtown 

That means the driver have to go to one side of the road , stop in the middle of traffic , maybe infront of the 300 congress lobby , but pax meant to say to be picked up at the northeast quadrant or maybe northwest infront of Starbucks

So best is to input the address manually , and drag the pin manually , share your gps location with the driver , and also text the driver saying you are at the corner of etc etc infront of etc business When you say “put my pin on this restaurant,” do you mean you are scooting the pin around on the screen until it’s on the restaurant, or actually typing the restaurant name into the search field and selecting it from the search results? The former has always been hit or miss while the latter tends to work better and gives the driver the actual restaurant name. As far as why exactly the former doesn’t work as well, I’m not sure... prolly just buggy gps. I have only used driver app. But oft times when there is a mismatch, I have asked what the rider had on screen. It's simply different sometimes. L

One ex. Like near a corner, Ur on 1st St a bit from corner, but that bldg on the map is kinda closed to perpindicular Bee Ave. So yr app may say 208 1st St & mine will say 388 Bee Ave. Other times the pins are simply across the street from eachother. I even have on my own app, the pin is on the odd side of the street, but the address says 388 B Ave. Sometimes when on my map, the pin & address don't match, it's the pin that ended up correct, others it's the written address. So it's a 50/50 guess which one to go to.

I would assume manually typing yr location in is best, but that's an assumption. Iv'e come to accept that the best anwer is the one already given before me. It's just a buggy app. Just type the fuckin restaurant name As a driver I frequently get a different address than pax claims they entered in. When this happens I take a screenshot to show them (since it disappears once I hit start ride). Super frustrating for both of us, and just shows that Uber’s system is still very much in-development.

You can purchase Uber gift cards at a discount. 10-15% is possible.

...not I am not a driver but can someone explain to me what the issue is here? But in all honesty I’ll just bitch about it during the drive to the pax lmao Nope Next Decline That part of Auburn is not exactly ""the sticks"". That's in the middle of the city. My opinion is in the upper left corner Fuck that shit This actually isn’t bad after 9 mins it starts charging the pax the normal rates of the ride for time and distance to pick them up. So 11 mins + 8ish miles will be added to their 3 min ride.  But id only accept it on a slow night or if I’m in the middle of no where. It's not too bad if you want to keep your acceptance rate. Go slow for the 1st 10 minutes so you may be paid 7 to 10 miles. So it could be 5 miles pickup and 16 miles paid. I also think you are paid the full 20 min but I can be wrong. accept and make him cancel. Just text him and say ""sorry there's a bug in the system, I'm 30 minutes away! You have a 2 minute grace period to cancel free of charge"". If they dont cancel just ignore them and take lyft rides. If I knew more about the area, I’d be able to tell you more. 

Here is my 2¢,

It would mostly depend on the pickup, and likely drop off area, as well as when the long pickup fee starts. 

Here, it’s 11 mins. So there’s 9 mins of driving on that pickup. You would then be paid 9/20ths of that 16 miles to pick them up. 

When it comes to is the ride worth it, with long pickups, your destination is important.

If that area is prime hunting ground, I’d accept it as a total 15 min ride with a strong chance that you will get a follow up ride, prob on the trip if it is that long a pickup. 

On the other hand, if it’s in the sticks and you won’t get another ride for 20 mins, I’d dump it as a waste of time. 

It’s going to depend on your experience to tell you if it is worth it or not."

Why does Uber vastly underestimate wait time for 80% of rides?,31,7.662757474826994,uber,It's really obnoxious. Do they really think the driver is going to get through 20 blocks of NYC traffic in 4 minutes? Really?,"Don’t expect big business to tell you the truth There's a few reasons I can think of:

* You have to at least claim to beat Lyft's time, or you won't get the request. Lyft has to do the same, so they both have to lie, and Lyft has to lie more because their network is sparser.
* If it said 20 minutes, you might not request at all, or you might forget you requested and cancel or no-show when they finally arrive
* It is super hard to predict short pickup times. One traffic light going the wrong way and your 4 minute pickup is now 6 minutes (50% increase). Driver takes 2 minutes to get out of a parking lot, same thing. Uber calculates as the crow flies...I laugh at some of my requests and cancel them once I start if the traffic is heavy So why don't you predict how long it's going to take me to go 10 blocks in Boston traffic at say 2:30 pm? How about 10:30 am? You can't can you? Because you don't know what traffic is like. All the uber system does is is give you the Optimal time as in traffic is moving well. 

Or hey, instead of uber going through a MASSIVE overhaul to get accurate traffic times in EVERY city they operate in AROUND THE WORLD.... how about you use Common sense and realize, yea, he's going to be awhile. 

&#x200B;

Finally if THIS is your biggest issue with uber, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you in Brooklyn. Do you think Uber knows what the traffic conditions are at all times?  I assume the system bases it off the information it has at that moment and provides a time based off that data."

That's a total of 20 minutes, for like $3.  So I'm making $9/hour at that rate, which is obviously trash.  And this is before we even include gas, wear/tear, depreciation.  So while it's not your fault that your rides are short, this is why drivers hate that.  Tipping really does help though.  But, there will always be drivers that are so desperate and don't think smart about rideshare, that I doubt you'll have trouble finding a ride and you can just carry on. Absolutely . Driver gets $2.80 and Uber keeps the rest and you people are not decent half of the time . No. Short rides dont bother me unless it's a bunch in a row. If the driver was over 10 mins away when they take your ride, a tip would be nice to make it worth his time getting to you. Not usually, but they won't really like you that much. Now, if you're only going 1/2 mile and it's a 2 minute pickup, yes, I will pick you up because the min fare for me equates to ~$5 a mile. Drivers have a hunch what they're in for.  I can name off the towns in my area where the average ride will be less than three miles.  Sometimes I choose to drive there anyway.  I'd rather a two-hour ride, but I'll take the next one that comes, so long as I'm not driving farther to the pickup than the actual ride is long. It's a bit short, but tip a reasonable amount in cash and we're good... Don't ever mention tipping in the app (most passengers don't and we've learned to automatically assume they're lying). Let's make some calculations. I wait 3-5 minutes to get a request. Pickup pin isn't far, 4min drive. 2min for rider to appear/enter the car. 12min ride. Total time approx. 22 minutes. You pay $7.13. I get $2.62. Wow, cool, in about an hour and a half I can earn for McD meal! This is a really good question.  Reading the answers it seems Uber does not make short trips worthwhile so tipping is only way to make it right.  Has anyone seen a list of social norms for ridehailing services. I’ve literally taken ubers for two blocks to do laundry because my clothes are too heavy. I don’t think they care and you should be able to take an Uber for as long as you please. Sometimes you’re in a hurry or sometimes you can’t walk. Yes, yes, and yes. Uber takes 50%, driver wastes time and doesnt make money. Bike"

That's a clever way of saying you hit somebody, but ok. You are out $1,000 bucks but make sure you report it properly.

[https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001562707-Insurance-with-Express-Drive](https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001562707-Insurance-with-Express-Drive) For multi-car accident, it can be complicated. If someone in front get a ticket, speeding, DUI, then everyone else may claim on that driver's insurance. Or, you are too close and fail to stop.

It doesn't matter what period you are on because it's all $1000 deductible. Do they allow you to ""return"" the car and get another one? You are responsible for up to $1000, which is the deductible on Hertz's insurance.  

If it is determined that it was not your fault, make sure you get the other insurance to reimburse you.  Hertz  won't give a shit, they will ding you for the 1K.

Also, it happens a lot, I rent from Hertz occasionally, and every time I go to their lot, I see damaged cars.  Its somewhat normal, especially if you are using it as a taxi. Donot say sorry
Donot apologized 
Always say the truth 
Let them decide who is in the wrong

Case 1: 
Uber Driver got into accident , police take a statement , insurance guy for the Uber driver found out that the other driver are intoxicated, Uber driver goes off Scott free with brand new car Another driver today? Interesting...      
Wonder if Hertz is doing some shady, yet tactical, insurance type fraud... I say, conspiracy! Kinda.. not really, but who knows. :p

Anyway, always try to keep a safe distance between you and the driver in front of you. Figure.. one car length for every ten miles an hour.     
Example: 55mph, try leaving up to a six car space between you and the front driver just in case the front driver gets into a accident or something, this will give you time to stop or react.        

Hope it all works out.      
Cheers~ Don’t do the rental. You’ll be out the deductible no matter whos at fault.  Then you got to sue other guys ins. Period 1 is not covered by Ubers policy . So you have to use your car’s  primary policy ."
Why are drivers cancelling just before picking me up?,84,8.273741271178478,uber,"Hey there. This is a recurring problem I’m experiencing with drivers in my area. A driver will drive to me, get within just a minute or two of me, and cancel the ride, forcing me to get another ride. To my knowledge I haven’t been charged a cancelation fee for this. I ride uber a lot for work, I have a very high rating and always tip. I just can’t imagine what they could be getting out of driving all the way to me and cancelling as they pull up. Any information on this?","They are cherry picking the rides, we now have an option on Uber that will show us how long the ride is going in minutes. The driver might be trying to get just long rides only Cherry picking rides is one factor 

Another factor is when they in ridestreak during surge they cannot cancel or miss a ride or they will lose the incentives, so they accept the ride , while going to the surge zone , and maybe press take a wrong turn or any other reason so they keep the ridestreak quest 

Another factor is when they have another rideshare app on such as lyft or any other , and got a better ride Do something to make your instructions simpler.

Green hoodie, Black backpack. Standing in front of California Pizza kitchen.

If it takes more words than this, move somewhere else. Have had the same happen before, not sure why it happens. More information would be needed. Are you doing pool? What time of day? Short distance (though they shouldn’t be canceling for this)? Going to a bad/high traffic area?

We get paid the mainly by the mile. So if it was a busy time, drivers may try to choose a better/longer trip so they don’t get stuck in a 3 mile trip taking 45 minutes. Did you get an automatic notification that the driver has arrived? That's why he has to drive close enough. Do you get the notification that he started the trip? That could be the reason because for sure he can see the destination. But that's risky for drivers to do that now. I'm gonna guess you may live near the hood Before you confirm the request, tap on the pickup pin on the map. Then type in the name of the business name and the app will give you a list of addresses. do you have a legitimate name on your uber or do you use something like Peaches or Diamond? sometimes if I think the rider is using a fake name I wont pick up Shitty pick-up location. 

Don't request a pickup at a major intersection. Walk a block away to a minor street, not at the corner. 

It never ceases to amaze me how people think a pickup point at the intersection of 2 8-lane streets is the best option. No they are all wrong, if is happening to you recently there is a glitch on the driver app that once we arrive the time says it's already been 7 minutes so we cancel and get paid lol Do u look like the wizard of oz? We get close. See where you are going and dip out so we dont have to go there Your ride is short and the driver wont make any money. 90%of pax dont tip, especially on short rides even when they get told that uber keeps 60% of the fare. Driver has zero incentive to complete this ride. However, drivers have to keep an 85% acceptance rate to maintain their uberpro status which allows them to know the value of trips ahead of time. So, since 1\2 of rides are short and worthless, driver accepts and then cancels to continue looking for rides that are actually worth money."
I wouldn’t be an awful person if people weren’t stupid.,36,8.378579234141442,uber,"So I pull up to the pickup point at a pet store and park directly across the entrance, in a parking spot because it was a small lot and I didn’t want to block everyone else. There were two other cars parked in the same lot, but my car was in the open and the only one running. I texted the rider exactly where I am. A couple minutes go by. I try calling her (which I hate doing because it fucks with my music and I have to restart my Uber and Music apps to fix it) and there’s no answer. There’s an old lady at the door of the pet shop, and has just been standing there for at least two and a half minutes. At my three minute mark, I cancel the ride for rider not showing up, and charge the fee (I do not waste my time for no reason). I begin to back up and pull out and the old lady at the door starts yelling and waving her arms and damn near walks into the street to try and get my attention. I ignore her and continue on my way.","If you see her why didn’t you ask her ? Older people have a had hearing You are in the right. You're not an awful person, there are some goddamn stupid peopleout there. I've been in situations where people have ran after my car even though I already cancelled after waiting the amount of time (sometimes even a minute or 2 extra) and they don't show up. They have our make, model, color, and plate numbers of our cars and should be able to see our car easily if people weren't so fucking in the clouds. Not my responsibility to look for my rider, sometimes I do to see if anybody is flagging me down. Then I'll pull over to where they are because they know which car is me and easier pickup. But nah, if I'm waiting then fuck that The rider gets to see make model, color of car, license plate, name and photo of driver. The driver gets.nothing but pin location and first name. It is the rider’s responsibility to flag the driver if he is at the location. Texting and calling the rider is the most he needs to do.

Obviously the old lady knew it was the car if she suddenly started waving at the car. It’s not the drivers”s fault she had such a delayed reaction to noticing the car that was parked right across from her. So, you saw your customer standing AT the pickup location, didn't pick her up, but still charged her?

That makes you a thief. Hmm... hope it wasn’t my mom. Can confirm. Lots of stupid going around in uber world. I don't know. Seems as if you would still be an awful person. \>  I cancel the ride for rider not showing up, and charge the fee

Last I checked, a rider is only charged a fee on their end if THEY cancel. The driver can cancel but it isn't going to charge the Rider.

Not sure if Uber pays YOU after YOU cancel, but it doesn't cost us, the Rider anything.

If I'm heading out for an evening of fun with friends, the last thing we need is talk radio bringing things down, and forcing us to think about things we're going out to get away from.

I’m sorry you have drivers that bring them up How about telling the driver this instead of whining on the Internet? Driver here, I used to work in politics and when people want to bring up what I used to do before ride share it gets very uncomfortable. I don't want to tell them what side of the aisle I worked for and I avoid all political conversation when I can. Just like my dad used to say never talk politics or religion. Same with the riders, they try to lecture me about Trump vs Beto and I’m like idc, just sit back and let me finish this damn ride Someone's grumpy Or do if you want to have a really bad time. Me I just greet the rider and if they don't talk to me then I stay quiet and turn my music off. Turn my AC on too the highest setting possible. Drop them off and Tell them thank you have a nice day. 

I realize the people who don't talk are the creepy riders and more likeky to give lower rating. Picked up a lovely customer in white city and he acted exactly how you would think, he dropped the n Bomb not even one minute into the ride then when he saw I wasn’t amused by it he goes your not one of those liberals are you.  I told him I vote with common sense I don’t care what side of the ticket it’s on, I’m just a American not a republican, Democrat or liberal. Literally just tell them to not talk about it.

Uber charged me $25 for creating an account,7,8.500720437869981,uber,"Hi, I just created an Uber account and linked my PayPal and was instantly notified by PayPal that they had blocked a charge of $25. Why did Uber charge me for making an account? Is this normal?","could be a temp authorization to ensure account is open/operational? Usually creation of account is immediately prior to first ride as passenger. It makes sense they would block a certain number of dollars so they are sure they don't get fraud at the end of the first ride, try and put the ride fare fee through and it gets declined or bounces back as a closed account - etc. this makes the most sense to me and it's probably just on brand new or newer accounts. On future rides where you are shown a ride fare 'estimate' it's likely that that amount id used as guidance for the pre-authorization and then at the end of the ride, if it's higher, then that amount is updated.

This same process is SOP when eating out - they run your card for the meal, and then settle up at end of night with the final - including your tip. They can adjust up or down.

Passenger music control,19,9.364736641631634,uber,"Hello all,

This question goes to either drivers or passengers of Uber, but has anyone come across a simple way for the passenger to control the music while on the Uber ride?
If you have please share your method.

Thanks!","Yes. They can request a radio station, or listen to what I'm listening to. Most passengers don't care, TBH, they just want to get where they're going. Mostly college students and younger people want to play ""their"" music on their 5 minute, 2-mile ride. I'm like, can you just wait five minutes before listening to your music? It's going to take me a minute just to pull up whatever song you're asking for, and we could already be 100 yards closer to your destination by then.

Like, how bad is their life if they have to sit in a car for five minutes without *their* music playing? I have an older phone with Spotify on it. Pax can choose their music on it.

Considering an aux cord as well. Here's my method:  


""I'm sorry, but the music has been selected already.  I only have bluetooth audio, and it would be a prohibitively long period of time to try to pair your device with my car.""  


Because I'm also not handing my phone over to some random drunk. The app used to have Pandora built in and the pax could control from their phones. I guess that was too useful and didn't contribute to cutting drivers' fares so they took it out. I have two phones... one for uber and one for spotify and pandora... i use one of those locks that they use for laptops at schools. And i just let customers  pick the music Aux cord. Although your playing a dangerous game! Usually people ask me to play something and I do because I use Spotify. But it's hard to drive and type. Aux cord is ok when the driver has one and doesn't have a Bluetooth only connection. I use Google voice commands, so it's as simple as ""Google, play-"" and whatever it is they want. Bluetooth receiver connected to aux port. If they want, I give the code. Auto disconnects when they walk away. Aux cord, but people with Iphone will be upset when you say aux cord. I have an old phone w YouTube red on it. I let them dj I'm a driver, so what I usually do is I use Bluetooth headphones for my phone, usually only one in. I'll have either the radio on or an AUX cable plugged in and ready to go for anybody to use. So if somebody wants to play their music, it's rather easy to change from FM to AUX or to just change the station. This way, I can listen to my podcasts and personal music (I don't blare metal for my passengers, usually lmao) and they can chill. I only allow music requests for long rides and even then, I don't use an aux cord because my car doesn't have an aux port. I put on a playlist or use Siri commands to play a song they want because I have Apple Music."

Just make sure once you get a driver, to tell them where you are going (via text), that way they will cancel immediately if they don't want the ride.

Don't worry. At that hour, a hefty cash tip might persuade them. Don't be surprised if they want to stop for coffee on the way haha Rent a car? Offer a hefty cash tip which should be standard practice for any Uber trip. You’ll find a driver. Two chances: slim and none.  Unless you tip enough to cover the driver's time back to SF.  If I'm not wrong, it's about a two hour drive, so tip at least $40-$50.  Cash.  And give them half of it at the start of the trip.

Trips Refunds,16,9.777977382386172,uber,"So, I have a question about Uber: last Saturday night I requested an Uber to pick me up. I was waiting for it to come with a friend when something strange happened: the trip was considered ""concluded"" on my app without the driver even show up and a fee of 57€ was charged. I thought I had done some kind of mistake (like canceled by mistake) and requested another Uber. This time I made sure I wasn't touching anything on the screen and the same thing happened. I lost 114€ in 10 mins.

How can I report this to Uber? What is the best way to proceed? I already filled the 'someone took my ride' form with this description but I'm not sure if that's the right move.

Thanks in advance.","That’s weird , if a driver concluded the trip ended early or not within its time frame, usually driver only get paid  the amount of distance they travel and the amount of time it needed to finished the trip , and not the full charges .. I suspect your account or cc is compromised , goto the hub and resolve this in person if you can Just try every single method you can uber gives out refunds like free candy That’s pretty concerning. Sorry that happened to you. Are you sure it's not a pre-authorization charge? Check your account and see if the charges are Authorization charges or real ones. Auth charges are usually placeholder ones, typically in the amount the ride is estimated to cost. Auth charges usually drop after 24 hours. If they are real charges, then going through uber's customer support is your first step. After, if uber refuses to refund, going through your bank is the second for a chargeback. Beware that doing a chargeback on uber can, and usually does, result in either a temporary (Give us our money, then you can ride again) or permanent ban. Twitter. Include the CEOs twitter account as well as the twitter account of your local government entity that oversees Uber. 

In addition to innovating on ride sharing, they’ve built an impenetrable customer service experience designed to make you give up in frustration and fuck off. Sounds like someone's spoofing GPS. But these trips won't hold up to a sideways glance worth of scrutiny.

To spoof GPS \*and\* also pass review by a real person, or even a trip modeling robot, would take some serious talent. Nobody with that kind of skillset would be on the uber platform unless they could pull of a large scale scam, ie beyond just you. I think you had Uber drivers walking around with the app on and collecting no show fees, Its an easy scam in a popular neighborhood You get a close request walk over like like your smoking a cig and chillen, wait 3 minutes, no show the pax then go get a drink at the bar!

Anyone have advice?","Is it possible for you to change your mobile phone number, and then update your Uber account information? was it a couple of times over this past year or several clear attempts of trying to get your attention? i’m not defending any form of harassment however hear me out with this - I shared my uber ride with an old friend one single time. now every time I order a ride, their name pops up ride there for me which I have accidentally tapped on a few times. it happens and is incredibly annoying. I do NOT believe that this is the case here, but I thought it would still be worth sharing. Can you share with more than one person?  It's possible she doesn't know she's doing it Ignore them like an adult? Are you a grown aas man? Then just call your ex- girlfriend  and ask her to take you off her shared ride feature... hey, she might want you back bro Block their phone number ."
Is this a common practice for drivers?,16,10.290697289812895,uber,"I tried ordering UberEATS for the first time today (DashPass ran out and I don't like Grubhub's app). 

The driver didn't attempt to deliver and ran off with my food. I'm so upset! I've never had this happen before. I've used UBER and drivers have no problem getting to my apartment, but the driver locator on the app showed the uberEats guy about 5 miles away. He talked to me through the chat and said the directions were wrong and asked for my address. I gave it to him but he still didn't move from his location, then cancelled the delivery. 

I called customer support and they said it could take up to 7 days for this to resolve.

Is this common? I'm sorry for venting, its just so bizarre and I'm so upset. It was a large order and I'm at a loss","It rarely happens to house but often to apartment complex with gate code / hard to find building number 

For apartment complex I suggest you go to main office / by entrance 

Uber eats people dislike to exit their car and deliver and they prefer people to meet them instead . Happened to me, the only time I used Uber Eats. (Except he reported it as delivered).   That's why I say most of them couldn't deliver a pizza without a pin.  So I stick with Doordash and Grub Hub where they are a whole lot better. Uber driver Scenario: 

Driver drive around without pax waiting to get a ride and make $, suddenly ping , a rider or Uber eats order pops up , driver click on it and go to the designated pick up spot/point . 

He/She follow the gps and have to be within 20 feet of the pick up spot/point in order for the timer to work , there’s no way around it . I will do it remotely sitting in my sofa and watch netflix if I could , but that means I have to hack Uber app gps location blablabla just to make chump change and free food .

Now gps on rider and driver works pretty much the same with plus minus 20 feet error  , and as a driver who have been driving for sometime now this is the only way to do it , there’s a hack that circumvent this , but mostly overseas and utilizing hack cc or account

Now as a Ubereats customer or rider he/she should have wait at the pick up spot the moment he/she press confirm button , maybe wait couple mins longer for uber eats since they have to make the food , then the food have to be picked up , then the food need to be driven to the destination ..

Usually rider will have a window of 2-5 mins depending on the uber they ordered, Uber eats is around 3 mins 

But all I’m saying is that driver phone(nor car /person/drone) have to be within 20 feet radius for the timer to works , unless they hack it that’s what they have todo .."
Question about Uber on Computer,4,10.303764419453564,uber,"Hey, so I'm using uber on a Mac at the moment because my phone is busted. Unfortunately I'm on a college campus. So when using a computer, I can't select the exact location where I am (When I do current location, it says i'm at a bank). And I've got know way for the driver to call and ask where I am/tell the driver where I am. Any way to give the driver special instructions on the computer version of Uber?","Input physical address instead of your current location, the location on your computer is not even close . So put a street address instead of the current location.  Try m.uber.com. 
If that don’t work text your driver with instructions and be nice . Then go find the location, or borrow a friends phone or Uber account and ask them to book you a car.  Uber isn’t a limo service, walk a few blocks, discover your campus by spending sometime outside."

A) I’m never rude to my drovers.  I have a 5 star rating. 
B) I didn’t even have my purse with me that night to have a pen in my possession. 
C) I never sit behind the driver directly, I sit in the rear passenger seat. 

So can I really be arrested if this guy is claiming this??","No. That's probably why you weren't This is why I have a dashcam. My safety as well as my passengers. Weird of the driver to go to the cops. How did he know to send the cops to your place? Does he keep track of names and where he dropped off his riders? 

Do police in your area usually spend time on such minor stuff?  Are the cops concerned about the crazy driver's fixation on you? I would be concerned about the driver retaliating in a scary way. No, that is totally over the top. What he should have done is submitted for a cleaning fee. What a dumbass. If he is gonna scam Uber then scam Uber some other way Stop smoking whatever you’ve smoked. Cops don’t chase people in Civil Cases.

Unless your PD is stupid they know better not to tip their toe in uncharted territory. [deleted] cops have access to anything that uber has about trips using the cops portal, http://Lert.Uber.com.  Just fyi, not everyone knows about this, 95% of drivers don't even know it exists. You won't be arrested it's a civil matter..ffs Bullshit post. Uber don't give out passenger info to cops. There has been so many cases where uber would not give up that info. Seems like and uber driver and a cop are trying to run a scheme. Also there is no way the driver could have known it was you, unless you made a big deal and shit. Just hope the driver didn't have a dash cam...

The smart ones do.

Doubtful you'll be formally arrested but you can still be charged.

If the damage exceeded the amount set by your state then it can be charged as a crime provided the driver has evidence.

The driver could have very well just submitted a claim to Uber who has kicked it to their insurance carrier and they are the ones who required the driver to submit a police report.

I believe any damage over $250 is too large for the cleaning fee charge and is sent to insurance.

If you are worried see if you can get a free consult with a lawyer now who could swing it in your favor if anything comes of it. BuT dID tHeY gEt YoU hOmE sAfElY? /s"
Uber anxiety,13,11.056750530614345,uber,"Hello, 

Female uber rider here. I used to use uber (and love it) all the time, but over the last few months have been hearing/seeing so many stories about individuals on ride apps trying to kidnap the riders, etc. 

I know that most of the drivers are really nice & awesome people and I shouldn’t have so much anxiety, and I track the ride on my app and always check the license plate just to try and calm myself. Even then, i just get so so stressed, but I sometimes need uber to get place to place. Any advice/words of comfort?

Thank you!","spare us the trouble and stop using uber. People get kidnapped everyday on the street, in stores, at their house, your in an uber that is being tracked! Make sure the pic & plate matches also their is a button that will call police in the app. Also they now have ride check if the car is not moving for an extended period of time or the car goes way off track they send an alert to both driver & pax to see if their ok. 

You should be more scared walking down the street late at night. Yea they can track your phone but the kidnapper will probably take it, break it etc.... In an Uber their is multiple phones & people tracking the ride!


Did you also see the articles about the drivers that got killed, shot, raped, robbed, beat up, car jacked etc........ You probably didn't because those articles are harder to find. Also some people lie to get attention like the girl that said she was ""almost kidnapped & sold as a sex slave"" even after they did an investigation and said she was lying that it was a language barrier problem, it was still shared over a million times & people still believe it!  If anything drivers should be scared of you crazy psychopaths getting in their car and have to drive you around . You should always offer an HJ  or a BBJ in the beginning of the ride ..it lessons the tension Booooring...Recent trend is hundreds...no, thousands of people suddenly start dying because of vaping.
Honestly, all that ppl's trust in all internet trash is just, err...cannot even find the proper word. Sounds like your doing what you should as far as checking plates.

You could decide to not go below a certain rating.For instance don’t get in a car with a driver below 4.90. Seriously? Get a stun gun/pepper spray/911 quick call app. Uber driver here,  before getting in the car, motion for the driver to roll down window, scope them out when you ask who they are picking up and if you get a weird vibe just walk away. You can always walk away if you get a bad vibe. You can always say no. It is understandable to be afraid. I text during and after the ride You can always live stream the trip if you have interested friends and family."
3 mile trip at 7am! Is it risky?,17,11.095674141736493,uber,"I walk 3 miles to work every morning and call for an uber when I go home. Occasionally I will call an uber in the morning if I don't feel like walking or if it's raining. 

I schedule my morning rides the night before and recently I had a driver call me to ask me where I was headed. He was not happy when I told him it was just across town. He showed up after getting caught in traffic for 30 mins. He basically drove 40+ minutes in the early morning hours for what I assume is $5-$6 (uber charged me $9.50) I tipped him 10 bucks in cash because he clearly was not having a good time. - plus I truly appreciate his service

Anyway, how do scheduled pick-ups work? Does uber ping this guy out of bed at 6:30 in the morning? do you have to be driving to get an alert? does uber compensate at a higher rate for weird hours or for shorter trips? I don't want to run the risk of getting 1-starred for an early morning 3 mile trip lol how the fuck does this shit work? What should I do to ensure I keep my passenger rating at 4.90? 

also the trip may only be 3 miles but it averages 7-10 minutes because of traffic","My understanding is it works just like a regular trip, except Uber sends out the ping for you 5-10 minutes before pick-up time. So it didn't inconvenience him more than a normal trip would. Drivers have to go online before they receive any requests. They know how long it takes to pick you up. And he's not supposed to ask where you are going. He had the chance to decline the request and to cancel, though for him there are negative consequences accumulatively. It's not fair but he can rate you his way.

If the estimated pickup time is over 10 minutes, it's likely that he had compensation like $0.10 to $0.20 per minute. (And more per mile if he manages to move.)

Sometimes what you pay is less than what Uber pays the drivers. So I suspect the real VIP's are some of the daily commuters. Uber will lose a customer if he/she rides every day but there's no driver to be found on Friday nights. You will be surprised what Uber is willing to do to get a MacDonald's worker home for a couple of miles. On Lyft, drivers can choose to accept your scheduled request or not, it stays in a local queue. All nearby drivers can see it and where you’re headed and they will most likely stay in the area when it’s time. Try giving that a shot.      
On Uber, the nearest driver gets your request when it’s time to roll... kinda dumb because as you mentioned, drivers can be far away.      
Not sure why Uber hasn’t added that feature of showing drivers available scheduled rides, it would be convenient for everybody and save time and gas. Drivers know if it’s scheduled and drivers collect a higher fee for no shows.  So when you said they called you and asked the destination. I thought for sure you were about to say they hid the car and waited to cancel on you. [deleted]"
If passengers could make sure they are dry before they get into the car that would be great,9,11.115176456551309,uber,Passengers often get into my car wet and soak the backseats. since this just takes time to dry and doesnt generate a receipt uber doesnt reimburse for the time it takes for the seat to dry. With this in mind if you could just make sure you are dry before you get in the car that would really help move things along,"Bring towel and put it on the back seat You're a towel I've got plenty of $20 and $40 cleaning fees from wet pax. It's not just water its ass water, I'm not just letting it dry im cleaning the seat. What if they're too dry though. They might leave bits of lint on your faux suede seats.

You should take the seats out and tile it. if you go to the beach or a pool party you should make sure you are dry first before you call the uber that way they dont have to dry there seats before taking more rides. Just a friendly reminder on how we all can keep making money and keeping cars in rotation. That's all I am saying if it's raining that understandable. Not yelling at anyone just saying as a PSA That is why you keep a cheap shower curtain or tarp in your car.  You could always just buy a formed fitting seat cover.  

If they are in the rain and you are driving on a rainy day then you are always going to get wet people in your car.   That is just part of the business. If it’s pouring rain then what do you expect them to really do? I’m sure they’d also prefer to not be wet, but it happens. If this is a persistent issue then maybe keep some towels in the car for wet passengers to sit on? Don’t discriminate now ."
Why was I getting a ton of promos before and now I don’t get any?,3,11.240153308414198,uber,,because uber have too many drivers. you are not a special flower anymore. I stopped doing uber for three months. Before. I never had promos in my whole three years doing it. Suddenly  now that I started again and I got more picky about  who I pick up since they screwed with the surge. I started getting promos all over the place. I think uber is using  promos to get high rated drivers who refuse to drive when it slow to drive. Also my acceptance rate is super low like 19%. I don't pick anyone up unless it surges past 5$. There no reason to pick up anyone for 72 cents a mile when car deprecation is a 56 a mile plus gas cost it is stupid. Don't was your time go home watch TV and cut you losses. Because  of this I think  this is why I get promos. Because Uber had it's IPO and now they have to try and actually make money.
Top Driver,16,11.336299141747533,uber,When it says Top Driver or they've been driving for 3 years... why are they the worst navigators?! Common sense is not something most drivers possess. How many times have you watched someone go in circles instead of just turning toward the pin? You don't have to follow the GPS exactly if you're own common sense tells you that you can just go an easier way. Pretend its 1995 and you don't have Google maps. How did you find places?! FFS!,"Just so you know the app isn’t accurate in showing where the driver is. Especially if you’re in a location with sketchy connectivity.

I’ve had passengers tell me it looked like I was going round and round when I had headed straight towards them with no detours. Sometimes I’m parked right in front of the passenger when they are looking at the app thinking I’m still on the way.

So don’t assume the driver is stupid. Sometimes we drivers think the passenger is stupid because we’re right at the pin and they are still standing around looking at their app not noticing we’re right there in front of them. I mean you have to remember every single pickup/drop off is entirely different and were GPSing, dealing w texts/calls from passengers and dealing with the customers IN the car.  Im not making excuses for the terrible GPS'ers I feel you - but I want to give context that just because they are a veteran driver doesn't mean they've been to the exact location you are at.  If you take into context all the multi-tasking PLUS driving, it can be super challenging to find a dot on a map, ESPECIALLY in a downtown area with one ways and parked cars. I have a theory about this.

I live in Atlanta and I’ve lived here for over 50 years.I know my way around my city.

I see a LOT of out of town plates.These people have no idea where they are going in my market.Quite frankly there are a LOT of people who should not be driving for UBER.

I switched to deliveries because I was sick of pools w 5 people that want to go across town for half price.

Uber and lyft have screwed the quality of the product because they want as many drivers as possible on the road. Brightest folks will not stick around for 3 years . So you’re not going to find anyone that’s bright . What you are getting are top among the worst ."
Question for drivers about Uber driver app,6,11.357676456576144,uber,"So I just started driving. I know that if Uber app is running in the background, it’s essentially “paused”. My question is this: I have an iPhone. When I get a text message while stopped and waiting for a rider, I will swipe down on the alert to respond.

Am I missing rider alerts when I’m responding that way? Thanks.","Uber app being in the background doesn't hurt a thing for me. It's still online and I can still receive requests.

My flight is at 7:50 in the morning, leaving from Disney to Orlando International. Of course I’d have to leave earlier than 7:50 am, but would it be easier to request a ride at like 6:30-7:00 or can I schedule one early so I don’t have to worry about a ride?

Edit: To clarify, I’m two weeks away from the family trip.","Uber app lets you pre plan a ride request but all it does is auto order you a car near the time you previously requested theres no additional guarantee of getting a car compared to requesting the ride yourself at the appropriate time. Just get ready 30 mins early and when you ready to be picked up , then order uber .. You can but as previously mentioned it won’t guarantee that you get someone to pick you up. Also I believe it may be more expensive pre booking, unless they adjust the price once you actually get picked up.

How is there not an easy way to report this? How do I best address it? Oddly enough (or maybe not because they're just trying to scam foreigners) this happened to me on my last work trip in Panama, too, but that guy only ran up an extra 5 bucks or so, not 30+, so I just let it go.

* Your trips
* Click the trip in question

Then contact uber & tell them what happened.

I don't get why drivers do this knowing the Pax can easily cancel the ride but I guess since only like 50% of Pax actually rate their driver, some drivers will take this risk especially at the airport since they know you are busy getting on a plane & not looking at your phone. Yeah I’ve almost always gotten the refund when using the help feature to challenge the fare. They’d rather err on the side of the customer than lose the $.

Uber rider do what am I supposed to do in this situation?,8,12.076310715865757,uber,I had an uber driver pick me up and tell me his app isn’t working and refuse to drive me to my destination.  I told him my app was working fine and shows everything and I was concerned about getting charged for the trip.  I got out of the car and I got charged for the trip.  Am I supposed to cancel the trip in that situation? Wouldn’t I get charged a cancellation fee? I feel like it’s unfair to be charged a cancellation fee when it’s the uber driver refusing to drive? What was I supposed to do in that situation? I did contact uber and got refunded but I just wanna know what I should have done.  Also if you leave an Uber driver a bad review will uber allow yourself to be paired with that same uber driver again? What would u do in that situation?,"You are correct. It is unfair that you should be charged in that situation. But as you see, Uber will promptly refund you the fee. They also know that many drivers do this and if it happens a lot then they may deactivate the driver. As to what you should do, do exactly as you did...cancel and then request a refund. There is no point arguing with a driver or trying to force him or her to complete a ride they don't want to do. This is mostly Uber's fault, since they don't tell the drivers in advance what the destination is, drivers only find out once they start the trip.

Where are you supposed to sit?,66,12.143081549199092,uber,I always sit at the front with the driver. I just assumed that's what you're supposed to do and I never questioned it. Is this normal or does one generally sit at the back?,"If you sit in the front talk to the driver . Don’t be weird  and keep quiet . I don’t care where you sit. But if you sit in the front seat I usually assume you want to talk.

Other drivers seem more picky but most generally prefer back right seat. Seat in the back where you belong bitch! 

JK, seat in the front is okay. Just dont touch my shit , that includes the volume button. please sit at the back, curb side. As a driver, I personally don’t care where people sit. But the general consensus on /r/uberdrivers is that passengers should only sit in the front if all three back seats are already taken. Im a female driver and Im a little paranoid no matter where you sit, but front seaters are generally way more talkative.  I do feel a bit more pressured to converse but no biggie for me. Back passenger creates a nice space between me and the stranger getting in my car. There is less pressure to chat but can build organically.

If you want the front seat though, I think it would be rather weird if you don't talk. I've had people get in the front and hop on their phone. Is awkward for me. Doesn't matter where you sit when you're by yourself.  If it's two passengers and one sits in the back and one in the front that's weird AF. back right. Most people who sit in the front right block the window or start looking ""for me"" and really block the view. I sit in the front because of legroom. I prefer for people to sit rear passenger seat (if solo pax). I don't necessarily mind if they sit up front - the ones that usually do tend to be older, male pax or really tall dudes that need the space.  I agree they are also way more chatty. But, please DO NOT be the only pax and sit directly behind me. 

If I'm the solo pax, I always sit rear passenger. I prefer the buffer between me and my driver. If I go with friends, then I take the front because I'm usually buzzed and I get car sick easily. If I'm with my three guy friends, I ride middle, because I'm smallest, lol. Back seat, right side. Claustrophobia. I always ask whether i can sit in the front. Have only had two out of 500 drivers say no. My husband says most of his passengers sit in the back. But he's totally fine with people sitting up front. He says they usually do want to talk to him when they sit up front. Do you sit in the front in a taxi? Back right. Sit where you want. My goal is to give you a comfortable ride and it's on me to figure out if my passenger wants to chat or not.

It's actually a fun little puzzle to try and determine what people want... Not in my car. No one sits in the front until the back seat is full. Especially not a solo rider. Front passenger or back passenger 

If you sit back driver I'm canceling and asking you to get out of my car for being creepy and making me feel unsafe."
Why cant Uber just raise their prices?,23,12.197132475138813,uber,"With Uber losing so much money, Lyft also. Why dont they raise prices?

In Miami, a ride from the airport in a taxi used to be $32. And it was horrible in every way. 

Uber comes in and the prices is $22. And its wonderful in every way.

I dont understand the pricing model.
Its an amazingly convenient service that people would have paid MORE for than the existing horrible solutions.

Why not raise prices?","Because riders would chose Lyft.... and vice versa. Look up a demand curve. The taxis didn't sell nearly as many $32 taxi rides as Uber sells $22 rides. I'd bet it's a 10x difference in volume. The taxis were a niche product supported by government monopolies. Low volume, high price.

So why do Uber and Lyft choose to lose money, rather than pick a profitable point on the demand curve?

They are optimising for future revenue. To do that, they have to maintain market position and/or expand to new markets. Customers are price sensitive and disloyal, so having the lower price basically guarantees market share.

Why optimize for future revenue? Because your shareholders want an increase in speculative value for the stock. That means, they'd rather you make 90 cents on the dollar today with a chance of making $10 tomorrow, rather than $1.10 today.

The long term future here is either that Uber runs Lyft out of business and becomes the new monopoly, or that Uber and Lyft co-exist indefinitely and the cut-throat pricing and low profitability continues, similar to the airlines. They are only losing money because they are expanding.  Their pricing model would be sustainable if they were just trying to service the existing driver/rider base. They have tons and tons of data, and charge what will make them the most without losing a ride due to the price 

They also charge different passengers different rates for the same ride.  I've heard they charge iPhone users more than Android. They charge more if your phone is really low on battery, etc. Uber was the big company compared to lyft.  They could have done anything and Lyft would have followed it . They could have charged a fair rate cheaper than the taxis  and paid their drivers fairly and still made decent bank. 
But no, they had to decrease the rate so low that drivers get 1950’s wages and  the competition is bad they have to lose money , Uber eats already did that in California Uber prices used to be higher. Then lyft came in and competed prices down. Lyft is usually 50% cheaper than Uber. I wonder if drivers didn't drive for two days everywhere what would happen Because they are losing money on purpose.  They aren’t trying to profit.  They are trying to expand and at least in Uber’s case, create an entirely new product using the money they get from investors (and anything they would be profiting from the original product) Most taxis are nice and the drivers are professional. The prices are higher though."

Have you had to pay for something due to an app error and not been reimbursed?,3,12.453347752952466,uber,"TLDR: Uber is refusing to pay for a boot on my car that I got directly because of an app error (an error that had already been reported to them 5 times.) I won't let them get away with this. Who else has this happened to? What were the details of your story? Do you have documentation of your complaint still?

Last week I was picking up for Uber Eats. I pulled in front of the restaurant and noticed that the app had specific parking instructions, so I parked where it told me to. (For anyone who knows ATL, I was picking up at Goodfellas, and it told me to ""park at the Varsity and walk across the street."") I didn't even think twice about it-- it was late, I was tired, and I figured if the app was telling me to do it, I had better do it.

I pick up the pizza, am in the restaurant probably about 7 minutes, and when I come back out, there's a boot on my car. I call the boot company and pay 75 dollars to have it removed. Then I call Uber support, and tell them what happened. ""We don't reimburse for that,"" they say.

So I go into the pizza place and tell the manager that Uber is instructing its drivers to park where they shouldn't. ""Yeah,"" he says, ""we've reported that to them, like, 5 times and they still haven't changed it.""

EXCUSE ME? This has been reported to Uber, they haven't changed it, and now /I/ have to pay since they refuse to fix their own errors? No, no, no. And it gets worse.

1. One of the Uber support folks I talked to on the phone said this type of thing has been reported many times and NOT ONCE has someone been reimbursed.
2. I followed up with the restaurant's manager who said that actually he's called TEN times since January, and suspects this ""has probably happened to 100 drivers.""

I have been bugging Uber all week and am still trying to get my reimbursement, but at this point I'm simply furious at Uber for being such a lazy asshole. I have some reporters interested in the story and would love to rip Uber a new one. I am also considering filing a class action lawsuit. If something like this has happened to anyone else, PLEASE let me know! I want to chat about with you and hopefully get your money back!!","So, if I tell you to park in a spot that is signed as a no parking spot, and you do it, am I now liable to pay for the resulting ticket? No, you broke the rules of that lot. It was likely signed as being only for that business and they probably have people watching it for people violating the rules. An app is not the law. If the person who owns the property has it signed a certain way, they are the law. Can't wait to hear the plan your team of attorneys will use in filing a class action suit for a boot on your car!!!!!   You'll get headlines in all the papers, millions of dollars and a personal apology from uber broadcast on tv during prime time!!!! It’s the restaurant that’s at fault. Where they tell you to park when picking the food up is something they put in their instructions to the driver, literally the same way I put my gate code in for the driver. Tell them they need to change it in their restaurant settings."
Uber Angel,8,12.847491271482022,uber,"I am in shock. 

Rarely, if ever, do I get the same Uber driver. I also hardly ever converse with them, let alone, have a conversation meaningful enough to remember them.

Today, in Winter Park, I was blessed once again with an angel by the name of Gary.

About a month and a half ago, mere days before my most recent breakup, a driver brought me from my friends home to my then boyfriend’s home. This driver (an ex-minister) sensed my discontent and started a conversation. A conversation which led to deep conversation and eventually prayer. A prayer about breaking soul ties and healing from pain. 

We spoke in depth about both mine and my ex’s struggles with pain, past, and alcohol. After the trip, I entered my then boyfriend’s home SOBBING over my discontent with the way we had been living. He could not yet understand, but I was forever changed.

Fast forward a month and a half later.

Just a few days ago, this ex and I reconnected after a month of not speaking. I’ve since been released of all of my pain; and the bonds of alcohol that I once had. He, however, is still very much in pain.

Tonight, I was blessed with this same driver!!

In the midst of the temptation I was facing to return the old life of fun and carelessness I had with this ex, I meet this angel driver again. What a blessing. We talked again about my situation and how happy I am now. We prayed for my ex this time instead of myself. 

So, so blessed for this driver who has helped my life and then reappeared again in the moment I needed him most. Still not sure how he’s real but I am so grateful.

Thank you guys.
Thanks for letting me share ♥️","You should write erotica . Love it !! I like to have a good conversation with my pax .. it’s like a therapy for both driver and rider I don't look at my ratings because it hardly moves. That day I noticed a significant change. So I think a 4 star replaced a 1 star. It happened that I had time to spare so I turned on the destination mode. I was giving up and ready moving onto the freeway to quit when I got a ping. I had no time to look at the pickup point and made a split sec decision not to go on the freeway.

Normally, the quickest way is to keep moving until the navigation catch up with me. I was in the wrong lane to do a U-turn. And when I did, there was a rerouting and I missed a right turn. So it doesn't look good if the pax was watching on her app.

Then I noticed that it was the community college. Normally, it will not be worth it - short trips, traffic, nowhere to stop. And if I'm lucky, I may have a dollar or two for tips that I appreciate under the circumstances. It was really optional because I would be late.

The pickup point was a bus stop with a big clear sign saying ""no student pickup or dropoff"". I stayed a 100 yards away comptemping what to do. Then K rushed to my car.

From the destination, it was obvious that she was late for her minimum wage job. But I was too familiar with the area. I go the other way almost everyday. So I turned the wrong way and had to do a u-turn. The distance was nothing but we had to wait for the full duration of red light.

I knew it wasn't going to end well. I could feel her impatience in the air. Because she looked like a butch, my charm didn't ooze out of me automatically. And even if it did, it wouldn't help anyway.

We pulled into the right strip mall and then I asked her which way to go. But the path to the back door was closed so we had to turn back. She did say thank you.

The next time I looked, my rating moved back. The evil K gave me a 1-star for being late when she was lucky that anybody was even there and took her trip. She was the only pax on that day.

I understand she was desperate enough to pay $15 to get to her minimum wage job. Actually it was 50% off so she only paid $8. People did a lot worse than she did. She could have arrived a few minutes earlier if I didn't miss anything. But that's how it works.

That doesn't make any difference to me but imagine that, the evil star will stay with me for 500 ratings when half of the people won't rate if there are no reminders. That will be with me for the whole season, half a year or even the full year."
Uber overhauls its app in ambitious bid to become ‘the operating system for your everyday life’,1,12.943069975185724,uber,Image,"No one is going to use Uber for their everyday life any more than necessary until they fix customer support. Soooooooo many issues like changing payment options screwing up, hijacked accounts people can’t get back into, charges out of nowhere, lost items, and on and on and the customer can’t get the issue even addressed without being persistent. Even then it’s often an unsatisfactory attempt and poor resolution.

I mean, it’s usually a canned response having nothing to do with your issue and then they close the ticket on you!

Their customer service will end them when the real competition shows up. He talks about focusing on what’s best for the customer...please."

Is there a way to pay the lower fare for the toll-free route, because Uber always defaults to the longer and more expensive route?","You can always tell the driver which way to go ... but how Uber charges you I do not know. Obviously the toll charge won't be included by but maybe you still have to pay the estimated/quoted amount.

Drivers are paid by miles and minutes and he has to pay toll out of his toll account and get reimbursed on his Uber account once the trip is completed. Take the bus and save the environment or try carpool."

I just had a friend tell me that as of Oct 1, Uber will not be able to take me from NY across the border to CT. Any truth to this? Dont want to get back and find out I can't get back. TIA",Many drivers will try to justify their “return to boundary fee” scam by saying the driver who crosses state lines will not be able to pick up a new fare in the new state and therefore will have to deadhead back to their service boundary. The driver will ask for a cash tip before the ride begins to cover their “trip cost” to return themselves to where they can serve again. The fact that they cannot pickup in the new state is true but it is not your problem.
Every Time,11,13.331472753010415,uber,"If im going to work...2 exits away, the driver complains because it's downtown Orlando. Or I'm going to Disney from my house up near Universal.

Or quit. But don't get mad at me for going to my destination.","To answer your question, the driver does not know your destination until he starts the trip (begins the actual billing). It’s been a thing we’ve had issue with since probably the literal *beginning* of Uber. That said, I agree he shouldn’t be blaming you for your destination. Most drivers just say “dammit!” in their minds when a troublesome destination is “revealed” to them, but then keep up a friendly, customer service façade.

Some will also still cancel the trip and ask you to leave, which I know wastes even more time as you now have to wait for another ride. This is why I wonder what the point of hiding the destination ever was. Sure, it sorta inhibits cherry picking of rides, but the driver can still nope out of a ride anyway upon pickup you up, so what’s the point?

How Uber took over New York City (data visualisation),2,13.452514419688118,uber,Image,"The thing that stands out to me is that, overall, Uber/Lyft *expanded* the vehicle-for-hire market. Yes, taxis took it in the chin with a 50% reduction in trips, but overall, by 2019, there were more for-hire rides per month than there was pre-Uber. This clearly indicates an underserved market.

At the beginning of the chart, there were about 15 million rides, and by the end of the chart there was 24 million, an increase of over 50%. Back in 2005 one taxi medallion used to cost over 1 million.  I know people who took out a loan on their houses to buy one."
Driver lockout in NYC. Rideshare apps have to comply with TLC (taxi commission ) rules and regulations which has recently made some changes to regulate the amount of drivers driving. Lyft has done this already but now With Uber also starting it this means drivers can be locked out with no work. Lame,20,13.5050838641436,uber,Image,"But as a driver do you want to be online when the demand isnt high enough? I wish they showed how many drivers were online to know if i wanted to waste time or not. This is what it will look like for any state where drivers become employees, too. Well this is what the drivers had been screaming about probably since about 2014. Now they have got it and the problem is it affects even the ones who didn't want it. That's how democracy works, everybody's got a voice not necessarily knowing what they're talkin about. Welp you wanted regulation, you got it. 

&#x200B;

Yes, Uber and lyft need to be regulated, however not in the way places are doing. Called it and racked up some serious negative karma when the new rules were first announced.

Everyone was like, hurray no more supply saturation, higher rates! I said, now you'll just have a 2 hour queue to wait through before you can log in.

or maybe it'll be like Amazon flex where you have to just sit there and keep mashing the button until you win the lottery.

Either way, the long run outcome is still really shity for drivers. Hope you guys in Cali who supported that AB5 trash are ready for this. The day Texas adopt this , will be the day I say goodbye for ridesharing... uber platform are to be able to login logout whenever you want , it’s a gig , full timers ruin it [deleted] Do you think it will be like Grubhub where you sign up for blocks and receive a minimum payout?

Do Riders have control over which seat they sit in or can Drivers dictate?,49,14.576947290138515,uber,"I got kicked out of an uber for refusing to move out of a specific seat.
I’ve always thought that UberX must have at least three seats (maybe four?) available to riders, so rider has the choice of seating out of those seats. Obviously driver can recommend or ask the rider to move, but rider is in their right to refuse.
What are your thoughts?","As a matter of courtesy riders should ride in the back seat on the passenger side. Most riders ask if they may ride up front but they usually want to chat. I worry about those who want to hide behind me and more often than not I adjust my mirror to keep an eye on the pax. Its not about rights as much as it is about being courteous and respectful. Drivers can always kick you out without consequence. Don't even think about anything else. are you a scary looking person trying to sit directly behind the driver? Don't sit behind the driver alone, it's creepy. If you want to chat I prefer the pax be in the passenger seat. Other then that I just prefer you not sit directly behind me if you're alone. Uber drivers are not Taxis. We are every day folk using our personal cars to drive other people around who need rides. Some drivers do not like people sitting in front, or others do not like riders sitting behind them. We have the right to have you move.

It's best to order it when your ready & see if there are drivers close to you because if there isn't you might be late or not get a ride at all because most drivers won't drive more the 10 minutes to pick up a Pax. Especially if your in the boonies or ordering at a time when there is not to many drivers out. Ya. Thank you. Cus the reason I would use the schedule a ride would be when I work at 6am. And probably won’t wake up early enough from a night out to get my shit together lol. Thanks. No. Only lyft can pre schedule"
"Account disabled for outstanding balance, but cannot access account to pay that balance.

Have you been groped by a passenger?,4,15.269574605011277,uber,"I have a couple of times &amp; want to see what you all do about it, &amp; what your gender is. Today I 3-starred a rude pax who never talked to me except to grab my shoulder and tell me to turn down the volume because he was going to talk on the phone. I really hate when cisgender men think it’s fun to touch me. I commented on his rating to keep his hands to himself. The other time, I had my chest groped by a drunk pax who got 1-starred after me telling him MULTIPLE times to stop it. 

So like, what about you???

Edit: please don’t say “file a police report”, we all know that never does a damn thing. Hopefully others can see that these guys have no personal space so that they can shape the fuck up. I don’t know why white men want to touch me so much. Get off my shoulder off my chest off my armrest OFF MY DICK","Ok all I want to say is the reason why you should file a police report is so that in the future if a case is brought against whoever groped you, the prosecutors will have an established pattern of sexual assault against the person. Sure, if you file a report as opposed to pressing charges, I doubt anything will happen. But imagine if every time Weinstein or Spacey or Kavanaugh (allegedly) assaulted someone, that they filed a report? They'd be behind bars long ago (assuming they were guilty of course). As a man I dont mind when women touch me. Never had a man try to touch me but if he did I'd conduct myself in a manner that says ""dont fuck with me"". People tend to notice that. Beyond this, such as intoxication, there's not a whole lot you can necessarily do to prevent an attack. If someone is going to touch you by surprise then they're going to have a high chance of success because you arent expecting it. It's what you do afterwards that counts. If you have to tell someone multiple times not to do something then you arent telling them the right way. Give them a consequence and follow through with it. You can threaten to end the ride, call the cops, punch them in the face, whatever, but dont bluff. Yup. Drunk men do it all the time. But no one got very disrespectful about it. They stop when I tell them not to touch me. I haven’t picked up heavy drunks in a long time. Only people buzzing. It’s cut down on the incidences I’ve had.  They get flirty but nothing aggressive.  That’s a normal part of this job if you drive at night. If they touch you in a way you don’t like. Don’t act scared just be firm. Tell them not to and if they don’t quit throw them out. If you are sensitive about it. Drive days.

How do I help my driver/delivery guys have an easier time finding my place?,24,15.701866271713817,uber,"I'm really at my wits end for this.

I do not live in a particularly confusing place, but it is spread out onto two sides of the road. Here are the steps I've taken to mitigate issues:

1. Live pin for pickup
2. For pickup, I meet them at the entrance whenever possible. For rainy days and for delivery I meet them at the sidewalk outside my building so they don't have to find a spot and can see me waiting/waving at them from a good distance away. I NEVER make a driver come to the door, I think it's rude to expect them to.

3. For delivery I leave a message and/or note explaining a) what side of the road I'm on, and b) how to get to my building from the turn in, and c) what my building number is. The buildings are numbered with large signs.

For further context, I do not have a gated complex. It's open to the street in two places. It's not particularly large. The parking lot is literally a circle so there's not really any way to get ""lost"" in my complex lot because if all else fails you can just keep driving in the same direction and you'll get to where you came in eventually, and have to pass my building on the way. This is very visible on GPS maps. I have zero sense of direction and aside from missing my turn into the complex a couple of times I never got lost when I moved here. I started adding the notes after the first several times delivery guys got ""lost"" in my complex.

I am absolutely losing my mind because only about one in five delivery drivers finds my place. The other four will pull into my complex and rarely they'll call or text me to ask which way to turn (which is in my note, and also, again, the parking lot is a circle) or in other cases they literally just sit in front of the entrance having, I guess, an existential crisis? Or they'll drive the wrong way, turn around, drive a little bit the other way, turn around, drive a little bit the other way, and never go far enough around the corner to see me standing there waving them down at the other end of the circle. Some of them have even called me and refused to come to me, making me walk the entire circle to get my food and walk back. I confirmed with my last three drivers that yes, my delivery notes do show up on their end.

It's not as bad for actual ride pickups because I can just walk out to the road entrance to wait but I'm losing my mind over the delivery situation and I've tried everything to make things easier. What is happening on the Uber driver's end that's making this so confusing, and how can I mitigate it? I can only assume something is wrong with the app/directions the drivers are given and that my notes aren't the right kind to be helpful.

Help!","Also for further context, I'm not sure if Uber gives you different directions when you are doing rides vs deliveries, but when I'm in the backseat for a ride coming home I always keep an eye on their GPS and it goes directly to my building, so it's working there. Share your gps location with the driver 

In apartment complex , front entrance or office is the fastest way , treat it like a stranger comes to the apartment complex for the first time. 

Most drivers never been to your apartment complex and to find building numbers blablabla in the middle of the night with not much visibility making it like scavenger hunt , ain’t nobody got time for that I can sympathize with the drivers. A 1,000 words without saying apartment complex?

And what is your experience of driving yourself while using navigation? 

And if there are over 500 people living there, are you comfortable giving out the address? Because there are just too public few examples for case studies.

In general terms, first, it is how you enter the pickup point on the app. The best is to search for Funer Apartment Homes and let the app fill in the street address.

A name is important because the app conspires with riders to misinform drivers in all ways possible. If you don't, the app may add a name all by itself that could be the McDonald down the road. And also, if the navigation asks the driver to turn into an opening in the middle of the street, we need something more to trust the app.

If the apartment complex has building numbers and street names inside, check if google maps know about it and use it.

If your apartment has two entrances within 0.25 miles, drivers can go either way. And the navigation apps don't normally know which one is the entrance or exit.

Send a message for the final instructions. Tell drivers to look for something easily visible at night while driving, not walking. Never call. I hate it when I am trying to get to the pin and then the screen blanks because of a stupid call.

The alternative is to drop the pin on the app manually. You need some map reading skills or it will be a disaster. Don't let the app drop the pin automatically nor share your position with the driver. That adds to the misinformation.

If all else fails, stay at home, don't order food or move. Message them you’ll tip 10$ cash if they find you. 

They will find you. I will look for a passenger who communicates and if we are reaching a mutual understanding. Otherwise nope cancel. If you don’t respond to my calls & you want me to get into your gated complex I’m just gonna cancel sorry. Nm judging from the replies on this thread the issue is that the drivers don't wanna fuckin read. Fair enough, I know you don't get paid enough to care, but definitely not gonna lose sleep over it any more. Call the driver"

Every airport is different , $50 is over exaggerating, in Austin Texas average is around $20up for ride to downtown from airport I’m looking at midland/Odessa, is there a good reliable site to see the rate?

This is in addition to the cost of the ride. Nothing big to worry about. Yes, and then that driver will rate you 1-star and you will soon be deactivated as a rider."

Uber Incident - Guest makes driver uncomfortable - Will I be held responsible?,6,16.162410253217374,uber,"Throwaway account because I'm mortified.  I (F) took an Uber home with two friends (M & F) after bar hopping Saturday night.  F guest passes out as soon as ride begins.  M guest gets a bit handsy with me and I knock his hands away several times and tell him to cut it out.  He still tries to put moves on me - putting my hand on his crotch and laughing.  He is very drunk, but in no way a true threat.  

At the end of the ride, we all get out at F's house and the Uber driver calls me over to her window.  She tells me that she has a camera in the car and recorded the trip and wants to know if ""that man"" is my husband.  Confused, since I'm not married, I tell her no, he's my friend.  And she starts saying ""he was touching you!""  I tried to explain that I appreciate her concern, but he's just drunk and harmless.  There may have been a language barrier because she still seemed upset.

Today, I get a call from Uber saying they need to know what happened during the ride because the driver was uncomfortable and thinks the guy was masturbating in the car.  I try to explain that he was a bit drunk and handsy, but that he wouldn't do that.  I tell the representative from Uber that I'm terribly sorry if she felt uncomfortable.  I'm told that my account will be suspended until everything is reviewed. 

I completely understand her being upset if she thinks that's what was going on... But I really doubt he was doing anything graphic.  I can't even imagine how the situation must have looked on camera.  I'm upset about being recorded and though I understand why the driver has the camera, I don't recall being notified of being recorded.

So my real question is -  what if it does appear on camera that he was actinv inappropriately?  Other than my account suspension, is there a chance of some other action being taken against me by Uber or the driver because of the perceived actions of my guest?","Yes, you are responsible for things friends do on your account. That said, the previous commenter was right. You can basically start over with a new account anyway. Odds are you won't have to because Uber will likely reinstate you. What are they really going to investigate?   

As for the camera, that varies by state. In Indiana it's perfectly legal to record my passengers without notifying them of it. Depending on the state you most likely don't need to be notified. Even in two party consent states like California we can still video record you without consent in our vehicle, just not audio due to old wire tap laws. Always remember that you are in someones personal vehicle or rental not an Uber owned vehicle.

Unfortunately, when people get drunk they do stupid things. It seems like it happens even more so in the back of an Uber where people who wouldn't normally act out seem to feel it's okay to do in an Uber. Honestly I do report drivers and do leave feedback saying they need to keep their hands to themselves. I do it for women and lgbtq pax and drivers. Sorry, you grope and everyone is gonna know U grope!! OP, don’t mistake that driver’s questions as genuine concern. They were looking for a reason to complain to Uber. And don’t even sweat it if they suspend your account indefinitely. You can make another one with a different phone number and email address. You can even use a different name or the same name.

Uber flying taxi. Could it be that it is much easier to make self flying helicopter drones than selfing driving car that’s why Uber is pursuing this?,24,16.186912568032188,uber,,"No. This is just typical uber ponzi strategy to bilk investor funds. Their next great idea will be a series of vacuum tubes spread all across the city to propel people across town from one point to another. But from a technical point, would it be easier to make a self flying vs self driving taxi....? Self-Flying helicopters are definitely in development with some limited service already.

In a lot of ways the AI is a lot easier on self-flying.  There are just less obstacles to be aware of.  That is why we have had self-flying planes for a very long time (and even self-landing)

Self-Flying taxis have already launched in Dubai (keep in mind)

The complexity in self-flying helicopters isn't the AI/programing. It is the moving parts, charging, etc.  It is more expensive to build. . .and more expensive to maintain than a car. https://www.uber.com/us/en/elevate/uberair/

Sounds like the driver did all he could but at some point (i.e. distance over the original route) they start charging the pax more rather than eating the difference they're paying the driver.   but nobody knows when or how this kicks in, they don't share their formulas with anyone (they don't even tell drivers where you're going before you enter the car) For your fare to double the actual route distance had to at least tripled, maybe quadrupled, as well as the time spent on road.

I would suggest shopping around.

Why are drivers able to accept the same rider they were canceled on by?,44,17.033683401434512,uber,"This doesnt make any sense. If I cancel on a driver, clearly theres a reason why I didnt want them and they should be removed from my personalized queue for this trip. What is the point of cancelling on a driver if you're able to get the same driver?

Been stuck at the same location for half an hour now because Uber decides to give me a driver, twice, that's 25 minutes away and has to complete a trip ""nearby""","The system pairs you with the driver closest to you, or who can get to you the fastest.  If you're getting a 25 minute ETA it's because there's no other drivers within 25 minutes of you.

If you're getting the same driver after cancelling, it's because he's still the closest/fastest. The OP isn't being an asshole he just doesn't understand how Uber works.  He's canceling over distance not car type. 

Uber really doesn't care about anything but distance,  they give the ride to whoever's closest.  It's possible that there was a closer driver that went offline, it's also possible the closer driver has destination mode enabled and isn't going the same way as you.

They typically don't reassign after you get a driver assigned, so it's possible you could get a closer driver if you cancel and re-request, but odds are pretty good you'll just get the same car again.  If you do it enough the driver may decline and now you have an even longer wait. You didn't know this, but if you grey-listed this driver your next match would be even farther away.

And if you were able to grey-list drivers just because the ETA was too high you'd gradually build yourself a little island with no service, by blocking one after another the drivers who tend to operate in your vicinity.

Uber knows this, and they know that result would dissatisfy you, so they don't give you this trap to fall into in the first place. You can only unmatch yourself from a specific driver after receiving bad service. Lol "" personalized queue""
No one is in queue to pick you up, you dont pay enough for that. The drivers nearby know you're an asshole and decline so the request goes to someone further away that hasn't met you yet. The driver closest to you gets the ride request. If you keep getting the same driver that means the wait is only going to be longer and longer. The ""nearby"" might actually mean that the driver is driving towards you to complete his trip. How are these two related?

Your question is really good.  As a driver, I wish they had a way or drivers and riders to disqualify each other (personally).   

But in your case, Uber likely wouldn’t give you that driver to begin with if there was a closer option.  Canceling and rebooking ..why? Seen a driver cancel a ride when he didn't like what items he had to take with the passengers,  then the same driver got sent back..... really uber let down or what!

This usually takes 30 mins to reach and the surges + drive up are usually 30 dollars themselves. But it's a hail of cancellation after cancellation because I'm the only car even remotely close. Who saw this happens and you get the same driver, you're only wasting your time by canceling them 

Also note that if you see a car closer to you they just might flat-out be declining your ride. Some drivers don't take pax under 4.8 etc Try a taxi.  Much quicker, cheaper too. Simple, YOU, as a rider, don't get to choose drivers not cars, unless you go from UberX to XL or some other. The closest driver will get the ping. The driver already drove to your location, your didn't like him/her/car choice, you cancel, drive should get cancelation fee for their time and expenses to get to your location. The driver sticks around for another ping to save on gas/money, you call, they are there, oh well... Funny how riders think they have choices for cheap prices.. Get a XL, Comfort, Select, Black, SUV.. Pay the price.. Or better, get a yellow cab! I get that you are concerned for your well being but not everyone is out there to get you . You wanted special treatment and you got treated accordingly. You have only yourself to blame . Use taxi"
Is This A Reasonable Cleaning Charge?,13,17.033694975519623,uber,"I was hit with a $40 cleaning charge yesterday, and contacted Uber support after I noticed it.

In this trip, I had ordered an Uber for my friend. My friend had brought an unopened case of cold beer, and this beer had condensation that got water on the floor mats of his car. Mind you, I live in Minnesota, and these floor mats he had were meant for winter conditions.

According to my friend, the driver asked him to clean up the water on the floor mats, which he did. I was sent 2 pictures of the floor mats from Uber, both showing no water besides in the wedges of the mat.

I found this very odd and was wondering if this is really worthy of a $40 charge. I also noticed that Uber specifies that there is a $20 charge for spilled drinks, which would be more severe than this.

Update:

Uber did refund me for this. They dropped the price to $20 to match a spilled drink and then gave a full refund when pressed harder.","I'm going with unreasonable, just keep arguing with Uber. I'd never even think to charge a cleaning fee for that. Take it up wit Uber and dispute it. That sounds like a scammy driver TBH.  I just have normal car mats in my car, and I wouldn't care if there was water condensation on them.  What does this driver do when it rains or snows out?  Ask every pax to clean up the wet shoe marks from the weather?  Come on, totally unreasonable.  The only other thing I can think of is that your friend brought the beer into the car with him, when I think legally it needs to be in the trunk (no open containers)?  Maybe the driver was pissed about that and got all passive aggressive on your friend?  I'd msg support and see if they can fix that for you, but this is Uber, so don't expect anything from them. Uber recently changed their cleanup policy. The driver has to actually pay somebody now to get their car cleaned out and upload a receipt to get a cleaning fee. Meaning you probably left a bigger mess than you thought you did. Yes, don’t lose your peace over this. You’ll get it back in another ride or two. Your driver cant pick up new  passengers untill he will clean it up .. it mean he loosing money. 
Next time ask your friend not to spill anything. . You should have wiped it up, it's called the asshole tax. The first person to commit a wrong here was your friend who didn't clean it up, and if it's as minor as you're claiming it to be, all the more reason to have done it.

EDIT: Actually now that I think about it, this should have been a $10 charge by Uber's own standards and he at least tried to clean it so yeah, keep complaining. If you damage someone’s car , next passenger will down rate the driver for this which was beyond his control.  This could jeopardize the drivers livelihood? 
Do you that that’s reasonable? 

Also why would you think it’s okay to bring beer in someone’s else’s car ?  If the beer was in a  holder , it’s won’t condensate like that . It has to be single can and it must have been open.  If your driver were to get pulled over , he could get a citation for Open container. 
If you order a ride for someone. ask them to behave like an adult if they can’t then don’t order a ride for them. You paid for the ride not the car . 
So admit your mistake and let it go ."
Can anyone in SF confirm if the option to drop off low charge Jump bikes has disappeared?,0,17.298058401445548,uber,"I had a ride at the beginning of the month where I dropped off a bike, but their GPS must have cut off halfway through.

"Riders, don't drop your pin in places your driver can not reach.",49,17.561183401456585,uber,"I have had this happen often with me where the riders will drop a pin in the middle of a large gated apartment complex where I cant reach with my vehicle. This prevents the timer from starting and the rider to take their sweet time. Well this morning I wasn't having it. 

Pulled up to the apartment complex with big large gates and realized it was virtually impossible to reach where this guy dropped his pin. There wasn't even one of those gate code boxes or call boxes.

So I got out walked around the gate to the pickup point, timer started and then walked to my car and let the timer count down. at 2:50 dude texted me asking how I was able to get the timer to start and ranted about how he wasn't ready. I felt nice and gave the guy an extra two minutes before I no show charged him. Pretty sure I saw him walk out after I canceled and was turning out of the complex. Sucks for him.

TLDR: Riders, make sure you post your pin in a place where your driver can reach you. And make sure you are ready to go before calling an Uber.","Dude definitely thought he was really slick, pulling this stunt all the time. Fuck people who think they're ""gaming""  
 the system. Fuck waiting for that jackass. He’s *intentionally* trying to screw you. Cancel for passenger behavior. “Hey I don’t see you”


Because you set your fucking pin the next street over.  And no I’m not coming to you since that may forgo collecting any cancel fee. I call them tbh and ask and am like “the pin dropped me here can you confirm the address and if you’re at an apartment can you meet me at the front office? You have x time before I have to move on to the next person” lmao they might show up Yesterday I set a record collecting cancelation fee during bar rush in Austin Texas

7 cancelation 

On each I texted them I have arrived and try to call them , some didn’t picked up , some picked up but sounds drunk and loud , the last one sounds angry and slurring 

Each I stay til timer is red and press cancel What did you say when he asked how you got the timer to start? “Oh, I walked to your pin to see if I can find you because I couldn’t get in.” I actually had a delivery where the pin was showing she was on a lake lmao and then has the nerve to ask are you lost? Umm yea wtf lol Yes please and thank you, we cannot drive through ROAD CLOSED construction zones or fences! My problem where I live is that whenever a team plays at our baseball field, streets are closed off right near the park so that vendors can sit there and sell food/drinks. People will place their pins right at the park or past closed street posts where there are many people walking and will expect me to find a way around. Ridiculous [deleted] I can't imagine a property with a gated service that doesn't have a way in for visitors. 

Whoever your customer was should have provided the pin to get onto the property. Good for you....  get your money.... Not an Uber driver but this system sounds flawed and prone to abuse or pranks. Why not just have the timer start when reaching the address? I’ve had pins placed in the middle of a harbor surrounded by water and also in the middle of an ocean. Pretty sure they were joke placements.

I’ve been fortunate that I’ve been able to get to most pins placed in the middle of gated communities but there have been times I’ve been held up at the gate. So annoying. Had someone drop a pin on a sidewalk, in the middle of a city, where constant traffic flows with cars and trams. Had to move 200m forward to a bus stop. You're a smart, smart cookie. I usually just eat it and if they don't come after 3 minutes, I  cancel as a no-show but they don't pay me. It's okay, I go on to the next person. if the pin is close enough next time I'm going to try that! thank you for the tip! You could have texted him to ask how to get in the gate. A little bit of communication might’ve helped. Instead you assumed his intentions were malicious.

Passengers don’t request rides for the sake of it. I got hit with a few cancellation fees, always been refunded In practically no time.
I actually was credited $5 extra in uber cash for cancellation fee issues and scummy drivers twice. 
I didn't drop the pin in an unreachable location, I took literally 2 minutes or less each time to get out my door. 
Inpatient drivers.  He could have set the pin or entered the address which automatically dropped the pin in a hard to reach place.
Even then, Uber maps doesn't show fences/gates, so to set a pin somewhere doesn't mean malicious intent if the pin is in a hard to reach place. It may just mean it was set how it was cause gates and such are not visible on ubers mapping system. 
It just seems a little dicky to get out, go around the gate to the spot to start the timer, walk back to your car, and then cancel for the late fee.
Typically, Uber drivers don't get out of the car. If it's a no show they just cancel after so much time.
Just really seems like a lot of effort was put in towards this whole situation....
Even if you haven't reached the pinpoint, the timer will still start when it's confirmed he's in the car...
And to have actually seen him too as you were pulling away.
Just seems like something a dick would do. No, I choose to. Free rides lol. You know the reason a lot of people are riders? its because they don't drive and if they don't drive, how can you expect them to know the rules of the road and where you can and can't be picked up from"

Do not do this.  The terms are way to expensive.  You cannot live on the whims of Uber.  You do not want to have to relay on fools to make a living.


If you must drive for Uber, buy a used car.  Buying is a way cheaper option and opens you up to do more than Uber. I believe Uber only rents cars now but could be mistaken. My city allows you to get a resident sticker for rental cars though. Just google “city name resident sticker rental car” and that should help. Check the driving requirements including license too. Also I think you need 3 years of minimum driving experience prior to starting with uber."
$5 Billion in a Single Quarter.,15,17.926565345914828,uber,"I was just rewatching the Plinkett review of The Last Jedi.

George Lucas was paid $4 billion for Star Wars.

Uber lost more than that, a billion dollars more, in a single fucking QUARTER. 

How is that even possible?

In one quarter, they lost more than Disney paid Lucas for the entire fucking Star Wars franchise. 

How does anyone still have their jobs at Corporate?","They didn't lose it. They spent it on purpose. There's a big difference. $3B of it was one-time-only payouts of original funders. The financial media **repeats**

#*$5B in a single quarter* 

**like you do** as a mantra to support predictions of failure. That tactic's an example of unethical reportage. They didn’t lose $5 Billion in Q2 alone, it’s just how accounting works with IPOs. The $5 Billion loss includes $3.9 Billion in stock grants from the past 10 years that’s recorded in the quarter directly after IPO and the one time $300 million driver appreciation award. The actual actual adjusted EBITA loss is a large, but much smaller $636 million. Deficit and Loss are two very different things.

Really, a celebrity finance guru is going for the most sensationalist portrayal he can.

Counterpoint. Amazon carried a massive deficit while it was still developing its market. Now, Ubers credit worthiness is certainly in a bad state. The bonds they issued only a few months after IPO paint a pretty damning picture.

But saying the Lost 5 billion because they ran a deficit is irresponsible and bad journalism. You need to step back and understand how publicly traded companies operate. Cause they make billions and n revenue each quarter I mean come on people.. uber did not loose that much money they have not lost any money they gained assets. the way business  works is if you reinvested  your money into another part of your business  you can count  that money as a loss as a business  experience...  like,driverless cars, Buildings  for reasearch , their big fat salary,  all that and more is a right off .. its tax manipulation... its ment for small businesses  owners to be able to build their business.. it was never ment as a way for corporate  assholes  to fuck the system.

Option to require drivers with toll tag,6,18.2870283089247,uber,"I think this should be an option. I landed at IAH and the fastest way home is the beltway, a toll road. My driver, who doesn’t have an ez-tag had to get off and take a notoriously shitty freeway with stopped traffic, adding 30min to the ride. 

This goes on the company card. I’d happily select a more expensive ride option to ensure the fastest, most direct way home.","All Uber drivers should get a toll tag for their local market, but it's not required.  There's no place to specify that a driver has one in the app.  You could try ordering Uber Comfort, and the driver probably has enough invested (financially and intellectually) that he or she also has a toll tag. Uber does not add the toll fares to a ride?  I live in central Florida and we have more toll roads than normal freeways.  Last Uber driver admitted he did not have a transponder and I assumed Uber calculated tolls into the ride cost. I had an Uber from Gary to Midway that wanted me to pay the tolls. Drivers lose money on tolls, in the long run. Blame the business for your bad experience, not an independent contractor who gets all the risk of doing business shifted onto him.

If you frequently have to take a ride on a toll route, you really just might do better with a different service provider. One that actually employs drivers.

Best way to handle wheelchair ride request?,13,18.568359327476333,uber,"My mother is elderly and disabled, in a wheelchair. She is quite small and cannot get into the seat of a tall vehicle.
When she requests a ride, she always adds a note ""wheelchair, no SUV"".
But often, an SUV does show up and she cancels.
At first, she was successful in getting refunds on the $5 cancellation, but now she is getting charged.
The strange thing is that her app shows that a refund was granted, bit the credit card doesn't show that.
Advice would be welcome. She is on fixed income and a few bucks does matter to her.","Also check your Local transportation they have a system called rideconnect. That is where a wheelchair equipped van comes directly to the door and picks up the wheelchair passenger.  

 Expecting rideshare to work with you on this sometimes can be daunting. As long as you make sure she cancels before the 2-minute mark but probably her sending that message is stopping her from canceling on time.   

You must take the time and sit down and write through the customer service of Rideshare what is happening. They will start to do the credit maybe on another ride, maybe not a full refund I'm just not sure how it will work. But you'll have to be diligent. As a poster said above you may need to look into other options for her to get transportation. Some areas have UberAssist available (in addition to UberX, UberXL, etc.)  See if that's available in your area.  UberAssist drivers have to have wheelchair friendly vehicles, and also have to provide a certain level of physical mobility assistance. As an Uber driver myself, as jaded as I feel most of the time with passengers, the fact that there are drivers who intentionally avoid rides from those with disabilities is exactly the reason we have laws protecting people like your mother in the first place and I hope those drivers that cancel on her are all fired. Does your market not demand Uber provide WAV as an option?  Ours does. 

The app should show your mother the name of the driver and the type of car.  If she cancels within two minutes, she isn’t charged.   Does that not work? She's going to be hard-pressed to find a vehicle like that. What area is she in, maybe we can work together to find you better transportation solutions for your mom? Feel free to DM me Thanks for all the info. I can check what she's telling me about the refunds. She told me she did see the refund on the CC statement, from the same day the charge was incurred, she's rather wrong, but I'll double check.

Question for Uber drivers regarding how it all works,6,19.047769049709594,uber,"My area (about 110k population) recently started getting Uber drivers (in Ontario) and I've used the service here myself.

So my question is - can anyone just sign up to be in any city and be ready to go for people to use the service there? Or can they only sign up for cities that are pre-approved (i.e, Toronto, New York, etc).

Thank you in advance :)

**Edit:** Important to note - it isn't just one Uber driver in the city. It started spontaneously with 4 - 5ish drivers. But sometimes there are none active.","With the notable exception of Toronto, any Uber driver can drive in any city they want.  
When you sign up, you do so under the nearest larger city near you, but you drive where and when you want.

It’s hard to get rides in small cities though as likely few people use Uber there. There are different licenses you may need for some larger cities such as Toronto(gta) which Uber will apply for on your behalf. In the meantime you can still drive in smaller cities and towns for Uber. I do not recommend driving for Uber personally but it can get you some quick cash. That cash is basically being taken out of depreciation from your car. First download the app and go from there ."

'An app my cat could have written': Larry Ellison reportedly says Uber's business model is 'almost worthless',9,19.222873216401094,uber,Image,"Shocking. You mean that if you continue to lose billions of dollars you eventually run out of suckers (sorry, I mean investors).  [When’s the last time you read a positive thing about Uber?](http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article65787.html) Uber didn't build a Java app, it is written in nodejs and golang, and thus avoided having the vendor lock-in Larry Ellison's Oracle is notorious for as they change Java language specifications from version to version and have new versions out too quickly for most companies to keep up. Once they move a couple of versions up, no more free security patches. The only way to keep up with the latest security patches and not have to constantly also change your code is to pay out the ass to Oracle for premium service contracts. So by avoiding using Java, Larry Ellison can't benefit from Uber's success by being a vendor. 

So that's why he thinks the quality of the app is shit. It's not written in his language with his vendor contract. Personally, I've never had a problem with the app itself. I'm not seeing that his statement is based upon anything technical. As far as the business model statements, what about your business model, Larry? You basically extort your users. As companies gradually switch to openjdk and other languages, you're losing customers. One of the biggest money problems they have is their on legal battles Its true.  When Uber insists that they are a tech company I always think, ""Pretty fucking mediocre technology"".

He was WATCHING it. Intently. Not just at stoplights. I shouldn’t have to tell the person i am
paying to drive me to pay attention to the road. 

I still tipped him lol but seriously if you are relying on driving as an income probably don’t break the law with customers in your vehicles. As long as the driver gets me where I need to go, is driving properly and is respectful, stuff like this doesn't bother me. Probably owns dj chark Jr on his fantasy team.

I literally have no problem with this I'm not saying he's right, and you absolutely should have reported him so he would be deactivated, but you should have told him to turn it off or gotten out of the vehicle.

I really hate when passengers do this. If it's bad enough to report to Uber, get out of the car and demand a refund. THAT'S why you only got $5 from Uber, because since you accepted the service as it was being provided, all Uber could refund you was from THEIR cut of the fare. It would have been illegal to take away the driver's fare since you completed the ride instead of cancelling it.

A passenger tried this with me a week ago because of this ""what's my name"" bullshit college campuses are misinforming others about and despite getting in the car when I offered to cancel since I wasn't going to give her the name of my passenger first, she rated me 1 star and tried to get her fare refunded by claiming I made her feel threatened.

Let me repeat what I said at the beginning so there isn't any misconception. The driver SHOULD be deactivated for this, but the fact that you keep complaining about the paltry amount of money you got refunded tells me you felt requesting a service, finishing the ride, and THEN complained about how unsafe you felt to get a refund tells me your driving motivation for taking this picture of your driver, posting it here, and bringing it up to Uber wasn't your safety.

Fun fact, while it's illegal to drink in public (like at your job for example) while there are obvious consequences that are deserved like getting fired or going to jail, being denied your pay for hours worked or services rendered isn't one of them. Had you cancelled the ride, you would have easily gotten a full refund. Since you completed it despite clearly watching your driver break the law, regardless of whatever reason you might have to staying in the car (running late, emergency, etc) you essentially gave consent to your driver to render services to you in the present conditions at the time.

Uber can be a piece of shit company sometimes but this time they did the legally (and I'd argue morally) right thing to do in this situation. Just remember, this guy tried this working the fryers at McDonalds and got fired for it. He doesn’t care about the job , low pay low morale , low customers service . You should be glad you got home in 1 piece. it's called multitasking. it's not that hard. What if you have a Tesla that drives itself? if u didn't like it just say it to the driver . u don't have to complain."

Need to Schedule a future pickup with Multiple stops,5,20.255708864571318,uber,"I have a flight to catch on Saturday morning, and figured out how I can schedule a future pickup.  I also want to pick up my friend (who is on the way to the airport).  I don't see a way to do multiple stops as part of a future pickup.

&#x200B;

I've read the only way around this is to schedule a future pickup to the final destination, and once I'm in the car to ask the driver if I can do multiple stops.  Is this the correct way to do this?  I guess he will ask me to cancel my current ride and just reschedule the entire thing at the present time to include the multiple stops?  Thanks.","Here's what you do. Schedule your ride and input original destination as the airport like intended. Once driver picks you up then you add a stop for your friend, and just mention ""oh hey Im putting in a stop to pick up my friend too"". He wont care, he'll get paid more and be glad to do it. I’m a driver and we don’t see scheduled pickups in my market.  They just pop in the queue like all others.  (Lyft allows us to pick schedules rides, in contrast.)

Would it work to just make your ride with the stops but not schedule it?  Or is the timing somehow not feasible that way.? DO NOT use Uber for scheduled pick-ups. They aren't actually scheduled or reserved. They just send a ping out 25-30 minutes before your ""reserved"" time and if the driver gets there early, they charge you for the wait time. Or, sometimes, the drivers drive away. I have been screwed on this for an early flight similar to you."

Wish I had a bike path by my place. ;P I don't see much benefit from this, unless they prevent pickups and dropoffs next to bike lanes. It's not like the driver can't see it in front of him. They did something like that on a section of a popular street here in SF. (Valencia St) I immediately assumed this meant opening the passenger-side doors because most Ubers in my neighborhood just stop in the middle of the road, and the passengers exiting on the passenger side open their doors right into the bike lane.

List Of Annoying Ridershare Happenings,13,20.61568571648112,uber,"A little bit about me or I go into this list:
I've given over 3,000 rides
I drive in Atlanta
Have generally had positive experiences driving
Most of this stuff on the list does not happen every day
There are a lot of things that happen that are really great like people being generous and giving good tips. That's for another list though
Feel free to add in the comments you're annoying things that happen or anything else you might think of.

Happy driving people, we're all just trying to make it..

1. Personal grooming in my car i.e. clipping fingernails, doing hair, brushing teeth
2. Passengers eating in my car and leaving a mess
3. other Uber drivers or drivers in general who just stop in the middle of the street without any indicators such as a blinker or hazard lights. if you're going to stop let other people know by using the damn thing on the back of your car that blinks! Not that difficult people!
4. Riders who give me a 4-star like what the hell can I do differently to get one more star why would you give somebody four stars and then I don't even know what I did to get a four star.... I put gum in the car I put water in the car I'm really respectful I treat people really great I'm communicative what else do you want!
5. passengers who have earbuds in and can't hear anything I say when they get in the car like: trying to verify their name and their destination can... you just really take the headphones out for like one second? is what you got going in your ear that important?
6. when you're on a busy street downtown and there's like six other businesses and you have an obscure address you have no clue where the person is can passengers give us a heads up and say hey I'm in front of XYZ company or I'm standing here how hard is it to communicate?
7. okay so this one is actually super rare that never happens but one time I picked up a girl from a bar in the afternoon like 3:00 she was super drunk sat in the front seat with me was super flirtatious started taking off her clothes exposed her breasts to me, started touching me FaceTime her friend and showed her friend a picture of me super uncomfortable ride. If I was a female driver and she was a male passenger it would have been sexual harassment and sexual assault and probably other stuff I don't know I'm not a law expert.","Fuck it I say give all the riders and driver's should start giving each others one stars and see what Uber does when everybody give one stars messing up rating system. 

Me personally I don't buy no extras for the car. I give you a clean car to sit in, A/C and music of your choice after that I am taking you from point A to point B. I will talk if you talk and if you don't talk then I boom my music especially if you have headphones on. I have a really high rating. I have one 1 star and all five stars no 2,3,4 rating at all.

Because the city bus is not giving you water and all that extra. Phone chargers gum or amor all tires. If your drunk your ride is cancelled immediately. Your not throwing up or pissing in my car. Period.

It's a scary thing if a woman comes on to you and if you reject her in a rude way. She may turn the tables on you and say you did something to her. There are some people out here who either used to be cab drivers or deactivated Uber drivers who will order Ubers and get into your car just to give you a 1-star or a four-star. There are people out here who have read and learn the system and they consider us minimum wage employees and need to have someone to look down on so they will hit you with a 4 *  or 1 * some people you just can't make happy I just kind of go with the Wind, rarely look at my rating.  

No eating in my car from the jump. No beverages what so ever unless they have a top.  Earbuds? They take those off quickly when they realize the wheels ain't moving til we establish address drop off, seatbelts and no eating, while verifying address! Personal  grooming? Some get away with it  if I don't notice, other times I politely tell them not to.  

Oh sorry to hear about that touching thing.  When I don't like what someone is doing the wheels stop turning. I don't like the 4 stars but think people do it because they feel empathy, it's a tough and something wasn't right. But then I do have riders that say they one starred their last driver because they couldn't get past the screen and start laughing

So it's a messed system, if riders can rerate we should be able to as well That last one was Sexual harrassment and you should of called the cops, reported her to uber. Yesterday I picked up 3 youngish people who ate the cough drops I have in a little bag of amenities. They then spit all three of them in my little tin trash can.... I could hear each time the hard candy hit the tin trash can... why spit in my trash can???? Put it out the window or put it in the wrapper then throw it away. There was visible spit in my trashcan... I was so grossed out."
Robbed by passenger,55,20.626530623899566,uber,"so I picked up a passenger after I went to t.j Maxx after bought a few items like $60 worth of stuff and the items were in a white t.j Maxx bag in my trunk. I pick up this lady and she puts like six white bags in my car from Ross in the trunk I take her about 20 minutes away to her apartment drop her off she gets in the trunk gets all of bags out I get home and low behold my t.j Maxx bag is gone with like four items in there worth about maybe $30 so I contact Uber let him know hey she must have mistakenly taken my bag can you reach out to her and let her know that I want my items back that I just bought. it's been 3 days now and this lady will not respond to Uber and will not call me. they've given her my number. Lady Robbed me and will not give me back my stuff damn I'm pissed. I thought about filing a police report and going to her place and confronting her about it but it seems like just a huge hassle for $30 worth of items but it's seriously really irritating why can't you respond and give me back my stuff?

After reading comments I figured I would mention a couple of things.
I forgot I put the bag in the trunk, my bad.

I'm not even upset she took it because I see how it happened. 

I'm irritated that she will not respond to messages from Uber to rectify it. 

To everyone who said I should learn a lesson... Umm duh?! Who doesn't learn a lesson from being screwed over this way?","Bummer sorry you lost some stuff. Personally I always get out and open and close the trunk making sure what is mine stays and what is there’s goes. I always take my phone with me too not leaving it in the car while I am out of it. Uber will do nothing more than notify her to contact you. File a police report if it’s that important to you. Do NOT confront her at her home. I always watch through my rear view mirror when pax are unloading from my trunk. If feel this. I got robber but for just an iPhone cable. I keep a USB hub behind my passenger side seat and used to leave cables connected back there so people can just connect their phones if they want. But one day someone just took it, I didn't even realize. But its not a big deal because it was like a $5 cable. I started going back to school and I was thinking about driving with my backpack(with my $1000 laptop in it) but I decided that it wasn't worth the risk of somebody stealing my property. I hate how we can't trust people anymore, and I don't trust Uber reimbursing me for my $1000 laptop. Unfortunate So look. You're saying you were robbed when what really happened was you failed to be responsible for your stuff. Even from your side of the story it sounds like the pax grabbed your bag by mistake, and now you want to file a report and/or go to her place? Grow up and take this as a lesson to pay more attention. Sorry for that loss.  I'm pretty sure Uber isn't going to do anything about it.  What I would do next time (or anytime you have your trunk open) is don't trust the pax to just take their stuff.  Either get it out for them, or stand there and monitor them to make sure the don't take your stuff, on accident or on purpose. You know, this wouldn’t have happened if you had gotten out and opened the trunk for them and stood there while they grabbed their stuff. In 2 1/2 years, I’ve never had someone steal something out of my trunk. But then again, I’m not a lazy ass who just pops the trunk and refuses to get out. This happened to me. Lost a white bag with 120$ of GNC supplements in it. Funny thing was, the lady was like, in her seventies and would have no use for a lot of the stuff. Never saw it again. File a police report. It will be a hassle for you, but an even bigger hassle for her. What will her neighbors think when the police come knocking.

Also, make sure via Uber that you have 1-starred her, and don't want to be matched with her ever again for a ride. Man, these responses are toxic.  I was on the flip side where I accidently left my phone in an Uber once.  Did exactly what you did and contacted Uber, who let the driver know of the situation (he never contacted me back).  I waited two days and was able to track my phone to the guy's house.  I called the police to see if they could handle it peacefully but they said they couldn't do anything unless I was there.  I drove to the person's street, called the police, who came and calmly rang the guy's doorbell, got my phone, and gave it back to me.  No paperwork/files needed.

&#x200B;

I would suggest filing a police report, have them find the person, and then don't press charges once everything is recovered.  It's YOUR possessions.  Mistakes happen, but the person on the other end needs to do the honorable thing and contact you back to return the items.  Good luck. > Umm duh?! Who doesn't learn a lesson from being screwed over this way?

You're the person who has to get burned by the hot stove before you learn it's hot Yup. Peeps b peeps. Most are good. Best not to fall asleep. I once saw a guy taking an empty Apple iPhone box from my trunk, I can clearly see him through my rearview mirror as he took it after looking both ways.  I didn't need box anymore but was surprised at human theftness Honestly could be a mistake. As a driver I always go and open the trunk to make sure they don’t forget something. Plus people are careless when loading or unloading in YOUR car. 
She may not use Uber often and it may be sometime before she sees the message. I don’t trust Uber to have really contacted her. 

Did you tell her that you have a white bag full of your own items ? When you load her up? 

When you drop her off , Did you open the trunk and let her take all the white bags? Sorry that happened to you, man. I second all the other opinions here: file a police report if it's important stuff. 

One tip that may be helpful: be the one to load and unload pax items. Sounds like a hassle and extra work, but at least you don't have to worry so much about your stuff getting stolen. I always have gym stuff in the back of my car (or trunk? Sorry, idk the right word), so I wanna make sure they don't mistakenly take my stuff...decent gym shoes are pricey! Whenever I have a passenger with stuff in my car, I always help them with their bags. Not because I'm expecting a tip but because they try to steal things.

I had to get who wanted to steal my firecrackers and had I not been back there I would have been missing them all Lesson learned. At least it wasn't a laptop like another driver posted here when a pax helped themselves to that.

Always get out to watch a pax remove their belongings from your trunk. It ensures that they only take their own belongings and it also ensures that they don't scratch up your vehicle dragging their stuff from your car. Don’t leave your shit in the car!!! Always take it home first!! How come people don’t do this? It’s like how rich college kids don’t lock their doors."
Fee to cancel when driver completing another journey.,6,20.843093123899564,uber,"I booked an Uber this morning. The time to pickup was 14 mins and the app showed the driver was on his way to complete another trip. After over 2 mins - but before the driver had completed the other trip - I tried to cancel, but the app stated there would be a £6 charge “for the driver’s time”. 

How can this be where the driver hasn’t completed the first trip? 

I’ll be complaining to the regulator.","It's always been the policy to charge a fee after 2 minutes. What does it matter what the rationale is? Interesting scenario.  I’m a driver more often than a rider, and have a couple of thoughts:

1). The app wouldn’t have matched you with the driver if there was a better match for you.  Canceling is unlikely to get you a car faster.  You didn’t say what your reasons for canceling were. But I have had riders annoyed that I took the trip when I still had another ride. 

2). Between the driver accepting the ride and your cancellation, the driver could have been able to accept other rides.  And, since it was a busy enough environment for you to be matched before the prior ride was complete, it does seem likely the driver would have had another ride offer pop up.  In this case “for the driver’s time” may not be the best explanation, but “because the driver had an opportunity cost” might be better. Don’t worry driver doesn’t get the money 🤔 Because you book that driver. He missed other rides during that time because he committed to you.

But also Uber generally does not give the cancellation to the driver in this situation unless they complain. This is an odd one.  Driver's don't get paid cancellation fees if we are still on trip with the previous passenger."
Any Uber Customer Service Employees Available To Answer A Question?,4,20.866079235021715,uber,"I was out the other night and someone left a valuable item and I want to get it back to them but I don't know them.  We were chatting so I know the date / time / location where they left (b/c I was there too) and I know the city they were headed to.

Is that possible to search in their database based on this info to find the ride details?  It was at 1:30am so there can only be a handful of rides going from this particular location to the city they live in.  

If it is possible, could I call up the customer service line and give them my contact information so that person could reach out to me and I can get them back their stuff?","I drive for UBER and their customer service blows chunks. I would suggest that only the person who actually booked the ride would have access to the details such as the driver's name and number. They have sent me emails asking me to look in my car for lost items, along with the passenger's phone number so I could call them and let then know if I found the item. Are you saying you saw someone get into an Uber to go somewhere and they left something at your location and you want to know if Uber will help you find them?

It’s unlikely they would help you because this would be the same behavior that someone trying to stalk a girl they met at a bar would do.  

Uber doesn’t even release passenger information when a passenger assaults a driver unless there is a court order, so someone “leaving something valuable” — particularly when it is only tangentially related to Uber — is pretty low on their list."
Uber estimates,10,21.332931086873568,uber,"Always need to double the time for how far away it says the driver is vs how long I end up waiting.
Is this a normal thing?","Us drivers can receive requests during a ride and something with the current passenger may cause us to be a few minutes behind. I’d say it’s safe to add 1-2 minutes to the ETA. To be safe just allow up to a ten minute  difference.. for picup and drop off.. you cant control  tradic.. it gives you an estimated  time. ESTIMATED It's normal because Uber constantly lies. They lie to drivers about how far the pickup is. They lie to passengers about arrival times. They lie to both about time for the trip. They lie to drivers about rider ratings. And they lie to passengers about driver ratings. Yeah I love when I get a request in the middle of a ride then a few moments later I get a  call "" LiKe HeY wHy ArEnT yOu hEre Yet? ""

Are fake driver abductions a real thing?,12,21.413984327625347,uber,"Had a friend request an Uber a few days ago, they got in and were supposedly going home when they got in a nasty wreck where all parties involved went to the ER. 

My friend was telling me about it today and things weren’t adding up. They received a No-Show fee despite getting in the car, and then they looked in their recent trips list and the guy who picked them up was not the same person as the Uber driver. 

Did they avoid a kidnapping and not realize it, or am I just paranoid and naive? (I’ve only used Uber 1-2 times)","I eagerly await explanations from all the active kidnappers out there. I don’t want to blame your friends, because that sounds scary. 

But they really should check the license plate of the vehicle and ask the driver their name (either their own name or what the driver’s name is) before getting in.  Not saying “Are you here for Luis?” But rather “Hi. Who are you here for?” And waiting to hear “Luis” as the answer before getting in.  Alternatively, they can say “Hi driver.  Can you please tell me your name?” , and then check that with the name in the app.  

If the car or driver are wrong, totally feel free not to get in. Most likely, the driver has messed up and not changed their car correctly.  Still wrong, but not really dangerous.  But if your mind goes to scary places, save yourself the grief. Does your friend checked the license plate and car model before getting in??

Does your friend checked the profile pic , names  and ethnicity of the driver before getting in ?? 

As a driver , we only get name , rating , and location to pick up , then destination after we picked them up,for uber there are no pic , no description of the pax.. so for pax to enter wrong car and wrong driver ........

They being said there is a case where 2 guy who is cousins, use same car and same driver account to do uber , and for most people who have different ethnicity with them , will have hard time to distinguish them .. also they only do airport run and so most of the time the pax won’t notice it since most only look for car and license plate Gonna go out on a limb and say your friend didn't check the license plate, make, model, color, driver name, literally anything and hopped into a random vehicle. Pretty good way to get kidnapped.       

Not victim blaming here, but use some damn common sense and don't jump into anyone's car without verifying. This isn't complicated stuff. [It happened recently in Australia.](https://amp.businessinsider.com/uber-introduces-human-reviewers-security-selfie-system-2019-9) The driver in this case used a photo to pass face ID. Was the car itself the correct Uber, just the person driving it was different?  Or was it not even an Uber at all? 

If it was an actual Uber car with a different driver then it was probably just someone using a friends car or something benign like that. 

But fake ride shares are a real thing.  I’m in downtown chicago and there have been a number of sexual assaults and robberies done by fake Uber / Lyft drivers.  They pull up to a crowded bar area late night and inevitably they will get someone to jump in  thinking its their ride. Stay safe out there and be careful . You don’t know who’s driving you . Maybe you got lucky that time ."

I think black car drivers are fully licensed and insured to be for hire. Congrats and good luck! Don’t do it !! Hire someone who drives for Uberblack. That way they get the full fare and not 40% or so. Test a few out in the area, and offer to pay in cash the one you like the most. I am sure most would jump at the opportunity as UberBlack rides are not requested often, unless in a major market. Most UberBlack drivers are licensed limo drivers (depends on market) who do weddings, airport runs, executive transport, etc, as their main gig. I would just call the local limo company and book it with them. An Uber driver is not going to want to sit around waiting for you at your wedding. Its a big risk to get married. ..
Congratulation ! I have taken more than a few Brides and Grooms straight from the wedding venue to home/airport/where ever...  as a Select.  I think its kinda odd but it happens.

I took one pair of newlyweds to the airport.  During the ride they couldn't keep their hands off each other. They were both so happy.  It was nice.

About 10 days later I picked them up form the airport just as a coincidence and during the ride home they didn't say one word to each other, sat as far away as possible from each other, and didn't even seem to acknowledge that the other one was there.

That was sad."
PROTEST THESE DETESTABLE WAGES,19,21.959308401713216,uber,"I propose we organize protests in regions where this pay cut has happened.

At first, I was okay with a small cut, like 10%, because a company has too make changes to stay above, but this is ridiculous that they cut pay in some areas from 25-40%.

&#x200B;

We need to not work for 2 days, comming soon, so if you're interested, message me.","You don't get paid a wage.  You get paid a contracted amount. The only meaningful protest is to quit driving altogether. Otherwise you're accepting the pay and encouraging it to stay low. That would be almost impossible though.. as drivers are a dime a dozen. Lol. Protesting only really works on small *few employee* companies. Uber has millions of app drivers worldwide... and hundreds of thousands in regions.      

How do you convince 100,000+ drivers to protest?      

Honestly, I don’t even consider it a real job or something worthy of protesting for. I’m aware what Uber is, I know what I signed up for... I downloaded their app (unforced) and read their terms. I don’t understand all this chaos. Drivers need to stop driving for Uber if they want a higher fares.  
Uber pays only what drivers voluntarily accept.  Right now drivers keep volunteering for the current fares so Uber will not raise fares.  

Drivers are 100% in control of what Uber will pay out.  Good luck with trying though.  For every driver that complains there are 10 more willing to drive for less.  
Uber will allow every felon and drug user to drive and those people cant work a normal job so they will take anything for fares, no matter how low they are."
What can I do to improve pickup?,19,21.96867182765018,uber,"I work at a homeless shelter. People chill outside who are homeless. I wrote in the notes “I work at the shelter I am wearing a yellow shirt” the first driver sat across the street and wouldn’t come closer. It is a 5 lane road not near a crosswalk. The second driver drove past me and stopped a block away. I walked down there and tapped on the window to get his attention to say I was his ride and he started to speed up away. Then I said he was my driver and he said oh ok get in. 

What can I do to make pickup easier next time I work? My car is in the shop all week.","Walk a couple blocks away and order [deleted] If it’s a 5 lane highway make sure your pickup location is in a safe spot, like a parking lot, alley, or side street. It’s too often that I see a bunch of dopes standing on the side of a busy intersection and expect the whole intersection to come to a stop for them so that they don’t have to walk more than 10 feet. The sad thing is that drivers see it is a homeless shelter and don't want the ride. I like the hotel idea but all you can do is explain the best you can and hope people are humans being bros. Go to a gas station / fastfood / someplace safe and recognizable , text your driver to pick u up there Is there a parking lot near by? My work has security and you can't get in without a badge so I just walk to the nearest parking lot outside of work Notes? Rider notes? You seriously expect a driver to analyze your info instead of just going to pick up pin?? After you request the ride, send a text (or call) saying where you'll be and what you look like.  I never have time to look at a pax's profile or notes.  Text pops up and gets read aloud by my phone. As a former homeless person and current driver, what pieces of shit. You could just message the driver and explain you work there. I’m sure at that point they would get it. Cut you hair ."
My Android app doesn't have an option for gift cards,1,22.190720438761293,uber,"So I was thinking of buying an Uber gift card for use in emergencies if I need it. I'm looking at the site for how to use the gift cards:

https://help.uber.com/riders/article/how-to-use-physical-uber-gift-cards?nodeId=a7e324f1-348e-498f-90f3-548b8d1e7c25

Particularly this point:

> 3. Below 'ADD FUNDS' tap 'PIN/Gift Code' (You can also go to 'Add Payment Method' and select 'Gift Card')

In my app, I don't have an option to Add Funds, or to select a Gift Card as a payment method. I just have the option for ""Credit or Debit Card"" and ""PayPal""

Is there something wrong with my account maybe? I even uninstalled and reinstalled.

I just checked the actual website and logged into my account, and it looks like I can add it as a gift card there. But not sure if it'll actually work in the app if I buy one and add it...",Most gift cards are actually really prepaid MasterCard or Visa cards that are locked to a single vendor.
Uber's new safety RideCheck feature asks if you're 'OK',5,22.243093123957514,uber,Image,"This popped up on my phone a few days ago. In the middle of a ride my passenger asked for me to stop at Taco Bell. Rather than do the drive thru he went inside. I was waiting for him for approximately 7 or 8 minutes when it popped up. I think it's a good feature. Uber doesn’t even believe in its own background checks.  
If they don’t hire people with felonies , 8 year old DUI,s, over 65 , illegals , this won’t happen . 
So what happens if you say you are not okay  or don’t respond ? Do they call 911 or  you send Uber SWAT team?

Uber might be saying hey the driver we hired is kind of sketchy, hope you are okay. Hasn't this existed for a while now? Back in June there was horrendous traffic due to almost every bridge lifting and I was stuck in the same spot on the freeway for 15+ minutes, Uber sent this notification twice during that time."
Uber Seeks to Build Up Freight Business,3,22.5035445128602,uber,Image,I hope so! Makes sense. Long haul trucking is where self driving vehicles are somewhat viable. They spend around a half billion a year on research to put drivers out of a job. Uber drivers run off to trucking and Uber follows them to take over that industry and turn drivers cheap.
Done with Uber,82,22.548498216563903,uber,"More than 6 yrs as a daily Uber rider with a 4.97 rating. I've spent more than $20,000 on Uber rides over the years.

I was in London last weekend, with a meeting planned at Heathrow before my flight home. I hailed an Uber and my app said my driver was 3 minutes away. Great! 3 minutes go by. No driver. So I check my app and my driver's sitting in his original spot. Thinking it must be a glitch in the app, I restart it. Nope. Then I thought maybe I should restart my phone and wouldn't it be funny if my driver shows up in the meantime? He didn't. Finally, after 10 minutes, his car moves. He arrives after a 15 minute wait. Not ideal but the Uber app says I'll make my meeting so I think ""no big deal."" After I told him I was in a hurry, my driver took the ""scenic"" route to LHR (doubling my rate *and* ride time). When we arrived, he shrugged sheepishly and said, ""At least I got you here in time for your flight!""

I waited a day so I could cool off and reach out to Uber Support without being rude and emotional. Their response was that they'll contact the driver and let him choose whether or not he'll refund me any portion of my fare. They can literally look at the record of my trip. They can see how near he was to me when I hailed the ride, how long I had to wait for him to arrive, AND they can see the bizarre route he took to get me to LHR. (For a visual, imagine a square. My starting point is the lower right corner. Heathrow is at the lower left corner. All it takes is one straight line to get from my hotel to LHR. Instead, my driver decided the best route would be to travel around the other three lines to get to my destination, even though the app, Google Maps, and Waze all indicated otherwise.)

This is unacceptable and there are other options. I'm done.","I would definitely reach out to Uber support again and let them know that it's unacceptable. What I hate about Uber is there is no way to call Just to put this in perspective - you got 1 bad driver and Uber's support sucks. These things are pretty common. I get that you're not happy with support. As a driver, I've been there too. But blowing up probably won't get you anywhere.        

That said, I have found success in simply repeatedly spamming Uber support with messages until you get the desired result. Support is mostly inept but occasionally they will actually read what you send. Most of the time they aren't even reading it. It's just a numbers game. Once this particular support ""ticket"" doesn't work out, open another. Follow that through and open another until finally someone fixes your issue. This usually works for me. ok drama.   I am also done with women since one of them hurt me. I had a similar experience in Dublin last month, driver sat there just waiting for his cancel fee.  I refused to cancel and tried texting as I saw him moving away from me.  He said he took the wrong passenger.  I explained I am a driver and it doesn't work like that and knew he was trying to scam me and he needed to cancel the ride.  He finally did, but Uber still charged me $5.  I disputed it, and they said they credited my account, but they didn't issue any credit.

I disputed the charge with my CC company.

Uber doesn't care about anyone other than Uber, not riders, not drivers. Yea seems like a major over reaction. You'll still use the app. Should‘ve demanded him to take your directions or let you out? Idk... This driver obviously sucked and he shouldn't have hung out for 10 minutes before heading to pick you up. 

BUT...for future reference, as a driver, I really hate when passengers tell me to ""hurry up"". I think it's rude. If I'm following the route the navigation gives me and going the speed limit, I'll get there at the time you were given in your app. I'm not going to risk a ticket for anyone, since I'm the one responsible for paying my tickets and keeping a clean driving record. 

Again, I realize you were late because of the driver. But maybe he was annoyed that you told him to hurry up and decided to take his time. I would do a charge back on my credit card. Uber support is the worst! I got charged $30 on a ride I never took an the only thing they said was send a screenshot of the billing after hat nothing at all! Lol Uber is a scam So what I have learned is when Uber says 3 minutes away it literally means 3 minutes away it does not mean will be there in 3 minutes it doesn't even mean they're on their way Uber support sucks. I'm surprised it took you this long to find out. Drivers get shafted too. I've had so many abusive riders who get away with behaving terribly. Even recently, someone poured beer on my car [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyWbeK\_hn9I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyWbeK_hn9I) as I was pulling to a stop to pick them up. I tried very hard to get SOME kind of penalty for this jerk, but Uber did nothing. Even after I showed them the video and explained in detail what happened.

Look, Uber (the company) is purely a hookup service. Drivers are independent contractors, each owning their own tiny franchise. You won't get any further complaining to Uber than you will complaining to Tinder after a bad date. That's just how it is. It sucks for both riders and drivers because human beings are jerks on both sides. If you can, find a private rideshare provider. A lot of us do both, so you might be able to talk to your driver, if you find a good one, and see if they are registered to do private jobs. I have my own business cards I hand to the good customers so I can keep them. Agreed, I'm done too. unsubscribing & uninstalling. 3 years for me. Good luck drivers. The sooner you accept you're going nowhere & leave this company the better.

To the few good paxx, ""so long & thanks for all the fish"" One bad driver and your done? When in a hurry if you don't see the car moving in 3 min, why not cancel and re- hail?  

There are millions of people around the world who have spent the same amount as you have, basically all you did was pay a car note for a mediocre car with $20,000. You get what you paid for.   

If you quit them and use Lyft there will be the same drivers. you may get a few different ones here and there but mostly drivers do both. For the price you paid you could book a limousine, leave early and catch the bus or the tram.   

If you spent $20,000 those are a lot of rides, by now you already know that every once in a while you'll get a cranky driver, if you've never had a cranky driver before then I call this post bulshit because every Rider has had a cranky driver, and every driver has had a cranky passenger especially in $20,000 worth of rides. You're lucky it's this was your first time most people have had weird experiences way more. This tiny miscommunication and one bad experience is going to prevent you from ever using a service again? Does't seem very influencer-like of you.  Drivers are humans just like any other worker, and I can 100% promise you we want you out of the car ASAP so we can catch another ride.  By driving an extra 10 mins onto a shitty path that would translate to literally a few dollars.  Please take a look at how the payment is based on mileage, time, and more factors.  I promise you 9/10 drivers are not trying to game the system, the app will shut us down very quickly if more did that.  Try to just see it as a mistake and move on maybe, similar to your clients and followers who make mistakes as well. > After I told him I was in a hurry, my driver took the ""scenic"" route to LHR (doubling my rate and ride time)

Doesn't uber charge upfront in London? Is it different there? Hello taxi /lyft 

Fun fact , Uber driver usually drive for lyfts Take the Tube next time? Time should be about the same depending on where you start (if not faster), and should be even better when Crossrail is finished. Bye Felicia! How bout you download the app sign up and give a couple rides yourself. See what the other side is like You whine to much"
Does this happen to anyone else,3,22.609644049908276,uber,Whenever I order an Uber x and white dodge caravan picks me up which is one of those Wheelchairs accessible vans. I hate riding in them because I always get car sick and especially because I have no need for it! How can I make only regular cars pick me up??,"cancel the ride before the 2 minute mark and you wont get charged the cancel fee and wait like 5 minutes to order a new ride and the weird caravan crew should be rollin elsewhere. You can't. You can cancel before two minutes with no fee. Or order Comfort/Select/Black Every time you order an UberX you always get a dodge caravan? Sounds like bad luck. Lmao. 

But to answer your question, I don’t think there’s a way to filter out make and model that picks you up other than selecting a different type of Uber."
Do you drivers get upset when you are tipped the next day? Sometimes a week later?,6,22.672120901760128,uber,,"
I have come to appreciate there’s a certain percent of riders I can reasonably hope to tip.  So no particular person’s lack of tip is frustrating.  And then, later tips are like little delightful bonuses.  

And, well, tips are money.  It’s always appreciated in the service industry. No, I'm pleasantly surprised when I receive a tip a week later. A dollar tomorrow is just as good as a dollar today. Would prefer same day at the end of the ride so we know that you enjoyed our time together, it's a reassuring feeling. 

If it's a week later it's extra money so that's always good but it doesn't have the same wholesomeness, if that makes sense

But at the end of the day a tip is a a tip A tip is a tip.  Sure we'd like to have it the same day; better with in the same pay period for accounting purposes (monday -sunday) but at the end of the day I'm grateful for the tip Not a lot of riders tip before or soon after the trip. They have a lot of other things in mind at dropoff so I won't get upset even if I am expecting it from the particular rider. But if they do, drivers will get the notification before the next trip; that will make drivers happy. Drivers don't care who tipped and who didn't while they are busy working.

Personally, I look at the tip pattern the next ""day"". I may look up the trip to remember who did it. Certainly, I won't bother to remember riders who I expected to tip but didn't. Same for the tips I receive a week later.

So it's hard to get upset because I don't bother to look up who doesn't tip and get upset about it."
Uber in NYC driver cancellation issues,6,23.08556997584524,uber,"Lately, every single one of my Uber requests in Midtown NYC gets accepted and cancelled within the span of a few seconds. This has happened without fail on my previous 8 rides. I’m at a loss for why this keeps happening to me. My rating is 4.82, and I tip 25%, within minutes of finishing the ride. The only thing I can think of that can be causing the mass cancellation is my destination (not in Manhattan).

Which makes me wonder—I thought drivers can’t see my destination before getting to my location? Unless there’s a workaround or loophole? I’ve also had a driver who called me up to ask where I was going, said he would see me in a few minutes, and then promptly cancel the ride on me the moment they hang up. 

What’s with all these cancellations? Aren’t drivers supposed to be penalized for that?","Your pickup location might be difficult to get to, other than that not sure

We can't see your destination until the trip starts, most drivers are able to see the duration of your trip prior to start Same spot every time? I avoid certain pickup locations that I have had trouble with (transportation hubs, or large buildings with multiple entrances that pax always mix up) I would try walking a block to a easier spot and try there. > Aren’t drivers supposed to be penalized for that?

If they were employed then yes. But Uber doesn't want that kind of relationship with their drivers. Thanks for all the responses, everyone. I think you all are right, it’s probably the pickup location. I tried somewhere new and finally got an Uber in 2min, no cancellations. Thanks for the help! They don’t like you , maybe the location gives away your ethnicity or income level. 
Uber racism is real."
Uber gift card via email help!!!!!,1,23.133775994377554,uber,Was wondering how long it takes fod a gift card to be sent to someones email. My brother just sent me a gift card almost an hour ago and i still dont see it in my email! Please help. I lost my wallet so my bus/train pass is history and now i have to walk 4 miles to and from work until my situation gets resolved.,"Next time just use Zelle pay with your bank, have him book the ride, or have him give you his CC# to load in your Uber app for a while."
I've stopped using Uber because of the appalling customer service,74,23.144111642525704,uber,"I used to take a number of Uber rides a week -- I have a 4.91 rating -- to complement public transit, but now I'm done with Uber. The customer service is just appalling -- and, if you have a problem, Uber will take zero responsibility.

1. Driver accepts my ride and then doesn't come to the pick-up spot, but instead calls me and asks me to walk to her -- this isn't that kind of ride -- and I say no. Driver messes around at a fast food restaurant for 15 minutes and picks me up. Driver then tells me her car is broken, and a few minutes later, the car dies in the middle of the street. Despite not being anywhere near my destination, Uber doesn't provide a refund.
2. My Uber driver is involved in a crash miles from my destination. I call Uber to report the accident and they are first concerned about the car, even before asking about me or the driver. When I request a refund because the crash happened, and I did not reach my destination, Uber again refuses.

And it's not just about being refused refunds, but about the fact that, whatever the problem -- even if it's a major one like the car dying or a crash -- Uber's customer service doesn't seem to care, they just seem to pump out variations of the same copy/paste responses over and over again. The customer service is truly appalling -- it's obvious from the broken English that they've outsourced customer service to the world's cheapest firms.

And, I say all of this, despite the fact that I have truly awesome promos from Uber week after week -- they literally give me a 50% promo (i.e. take four rides the week before and get 50% off the next week) almost every week, which would make Uber almost as cheap as public transit or driving my own car.

I'm done, though. I don't want to be in a situation where I have ""vomit fraud"" happen or some other nightmarish situation -- and then have to deal with Uber's awful customer service.

Good bye, Uber.","Yeah, the support is truly awful on the driver side as well. “Sorry for the inconvenience” Yup I’ve stopped using Uber/Lyft for similar reasons. What really drove me over the edge was the “pickup fraud” BS, where a driver accepts a ride and then doesn’t come to you, forcing you to cancel and pay them $5.  I primarily use public transit but the last leg of my bus-train-bus journey is a bus that doesn’t run on weekends. There is literally no other way for me to get home outside of Uber/lyft; all the local taxi companies folded a couple years ago. 

So the train station is in a really bad neighborhood. Pretty much the worst place for a woman to be alone at night. Standing there, alone in the dark, holding an expensive phone, while the many Uber rides I call for never, ever come.... probably one of the most dangerous situations I’ve ever been in.  

I have a 5.0 rating and I’m always a good pax. I don’t fuss about the radio, I don’t eat or drink or smoke or vomit in the car and I’m careful not to leave items behind. But none of that fucking matters because Uber drivers would rather make an easy $5 than actually do the job they agreed to when they accepted my request. 

And before you ask, nope, there’s no security at the train station after 6pm. Trains arriving well past midnight but I guess that’s not important 🤷🏻‍♀️ If Uber provided good support, then the rides would have to cost a lot more. I've deactivated mine today because over the last few months despite me not being drunk, not making a mess in Ubers, always being respectful and courteous and always being the one ready and waiting for the driver, my rating dropped under a 4.5 in a matter of weeks and I realised I would now be seen as a customer to avoid. 

I've read it might be because of low tipping, and I can't be bothered with a company who sees someone who doesn't always add £5 to their journey as somehow worse than people I know who've puked in Ubers multiple times and still manage to have a higher rating. There are plenty of alternatives in London, so I'll give them a go. Uber has always maintained that they won’t refund if you don’t make it the full way to your destination, they just lower the amount you pay to as if the destination were where you ended the trip because they still have to pay the driver for the time/gas/wear and tear on their vehicle for how far they did get you is Dara good for Uber? Or is he just letting it rot in to the ground? Certainly less talkative than Kalanick Their customer service is garbage, I agree I had an Uber driver try to steal credit card info via a phone call to me as they where on their way to pick me up. I canceled and tried to contact Uber. That’s when I found out it was nearly impossible to reach their support Bots bots bits and more bots. I'm surprised you were able to get in contact with customer service.
 Last night, I bought and added a $25 gift card to my account. Right after, I ordered a ride that came up to $25.17. On my way to my destination, I had the driver to stop at a gas station so I could buy a few things and wouldn't you know it, my debit card was fkn declined! All I could do was slink my embarrassed ass back to the car confused but I somehow already knew that it had to be some of Uber's bullshit. I checked my bank account and confirmed it with a hold that matched my fare. I just figured a simple phone call to customer service would settle the matter. The payment could get switched to the gift card and my money hold could be quickly returned before I reached my destination. So, I gets to Googling, no number.  I looked through the app, no number. I looked through the app some more because I just knew I had to be missing something. By that point I kept getting routed through a series of ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" help topics and I was getting absolutely heated! After 10 minutes of searching, I finally resigned to the help topic that sort of matched my situation only to find that Uber really is on some real live BULLSHIT! What I found out was that if your fare amount is greater than the amount of your gift card, the entire cost of your ride defaults to your original default payment method (Like, seriously WT entire Fuck?!?!). However, I found an option to mitigate this fuckery by requesting a payment method change for that ride. But, it doesn't help me much. I'm out of the amount that I paid for the gift card (cost me $20 w/ a discount) and a major chunk of the remaining $26 that I had left in my bank account (albeit temporarily, but still) until they finish processing on their end. So I'm pretty much broke for the day over Uber's inability to follow normal retail practices in regard to processing gift cards (you know, gift card first then backup payment method). All over 17 FUCKING CENTS!!!  
I know $25 bucks might not seem like a lot but damnit, it's pay week for me and I'm sure some of you know how it is on the days leading up. However, I'm also just as pissed at the fact that there is no real customer service to even handle small problems like that. No emails, chats, and/or hours - days of correspondence. Just a phone number you can call and get some shit handled by someone would be nice. For all that, Uber won't be getting any more of my money no time soon. It'll be a loooong time before I'll ever hop this ass in a Uber again! I agree with everything you’re complaining about...but, if your driver is stopped at the pickup location when you requested, you absolutely should be walking or changing to right in front of your feet. Taxi time Nice! Now learn how to drive! Use lyft.  It is 50% of the price of Uber anyways."
A story about how I did a nice thing as a driver,17,23.19291951290435,uber,"Was pumping gas when I got a ride 6 minutes away for a short trip, immediately followed by a phone call from the passenger, he explains you me that he'd in the side of the freeway and needs me to pick him up to take him to go get gas and go back to his car, then I was like ""hey I'm literally at the gas station right now, do you want me to just but a 1 gallon gas can and bring that to you"" homeboy was ecstatic at the offer and promptly I bought the gas can filled it up and drove to the. He was fuckin stoked that I showed up, I told him the can and gas was $15.32, he gave me $40 while thing took me less than 10 minutes, he left me a compliment on my wall saying ""thanks for the gas 👍"" just a fun story I have of helping people out when I totally didn't need to and it paying off","Aww this story of two young ladies I was going to pick up at Applebees. I went over there per the request to pick them up and before leaving the parking lot I asked them ""oh you're leaving your car there?"" They replied ""yeah the battery died so we requested an Uber to get home."" I turned back to their car they were getting stuff from initially, they ask me ""why did you park right next to our car?"" I told them that I had a portable jumpstart and I was going to help them jumpstart their car. In the end I was able to get them back on the road in their car and told me to get their alternator checked just in case. They were happy and wanted to tip me but I canceled the trip before we got out of my car to jumpstart theirs. Felt like a little hero since they were so happy. My heart is melting. I tried to be nice to pax couple of times it kinda bite me in the ass though

Ex: pick up pax downtown , going to best western , we arrived and I ended the ride , girl says it’s not this bestwestern but the one the other side of town, her phone died , I told her well I can take her if she gonna pay in cash , she said okay, ride is about 14 miles , it was during surge also, and im on streak ride , when we arrived at the destination she said she only have $10 cash and will tip in the app... it’s been 1 week and I have not seen the tip

Ex2: pick up a pax downtown ,a couple , I drove them to an apartment , guy says can I drive back to downtown to his apartment after , I said sure , he said will tip in the app good, it’s been 6 months , didn’t see the $20 he promises :( Thanks for the gas, now people going to think you either farted or you're a drug dealer lol people who are kind and considerate generally live longer Tell the other stories where you got bent over..."
Who else agrees the new Uber Eats pay sucks 😡,11,23.313266735126575,uber,,"It was already miserable to begin with, now they made it worse ? On the client side it's great they let you add the tip at order but terrible that it still comes in as 2 separate charges Did they announce the changes? I see people saying it snuck up on them but they can't of changed it without announcing it. 

&#x200B;

I don't eats just wondering. What changed? I haven't seen any posts about recent pay changes. They cut rates in South Florida in June but I didn't hear about other regions.

"Last time I used uber was June 5. I dont have it on my phone anymore. Just got this text, should I be concerned?",2,23.318162568470946,uber,Image,"That’s a legit text from uber . Someone’s trying to log in. 
When you log into uber you either enter your phone number or email , then it will auto generate the code and text you. You enter that code and the next prompt will ask you for your password.

Looks like you are using a VOIP number, so it’s better to log in and change your password. If not I won’t worry about it ,


Or maybe Uber is desperate and wants you to use their service . Yep, you should be."
Why would driver show up in a different car?,15,23.380986642556056,uber,"This morning my Uber driver showed up in a Kia instead of a Chevy. When I asked him about it, he seemed to just make up something and said 'Not sure, you know how these carpools are'. Huh? 

When I got out of the car, I noticed a 'GETAROUND' sticker on one of the windows. 

Not sure what the deal was. Any ideas?

Anyways, the trip was okay but I reported it through the app since the car and license plate did not match what the app stated.","Don't EVER get into a car if it is not the same. Immediately call Uber/Lyft support and report the ride, and be ready to call 911 and run away if the driver is trying to force you into the car. 

I am a driver. Drivers can have multiple cars on their account. That's not an issue. One time I almost forgot to switch cars before starting a shift. I'm sure this happens a lot with people. 

Here are the scenarios of what happens if a driver is a different vehicle: 

- The driver says ""Oh no! Sorry!"" and has to cancel the ride. He cancels the ride, switches cars, and you probably get matched up with him again, since he's the closest. It's a harmless mistake.

- You say nothing. The driver is a legit driver, but is using a vehicle that is NOT approved for the Uber app, for whatever reason, meaning insurance does *not* cover your trip, and if you get in an accident, everyone is screwed over.

- The driver is not who they say they are, and could be using a stolen phone, or a stolen vehicle. You're about to robbed or worse. What probably happened is he rented a Getaround rental car for the day.  In my market (Portland), Getaround cars can be rented for about $60/day to drive for Uber.  So, it probably was legit. 

That said, the info in the app should be fixed so passengers see correct information.  I would totally believe it was Uber’s fault.  However, it seems like the driver was evasive.  So he was likely too lazy or confused to fix it. 

To;dr: not wrong to report.  But probably wasn’t as sketchy as it probably seemed. If the car that shows up does not match the apps description, I would report it. I'm guessing the driver forgot to switch which car he was using. When you log in you can switch cars you're using. I had a Kia Soul and a Camry for awhile. I had to switch to the Kia while my Camry went in for body work. 

&#x200B;

I still might mention it to uber just in case he did it WITHOUT going through uber. I use two of my cars. One time I forgot to switch over. Wait so you still got in? I swear sometimes people just get themselves killed. Driver here, messed up my car on Sunday. Was driving my other car the night before and the next day forgot to switch it. First person acted really weird but got in and didn't say anything about my car being wrong. Second ride told me it was wrong car. I apologized and explained what happened and made the switch in the apps. No big deal, all good. Come to find the first person reported me. Lol They were from a big city (I drive in a small town) and were scared...even though they got in my car and tipped me. LMFAO! Explained what happened to Uber all good. We are human and make mistakes. Never get into a car that does not match the car and license plate.  Are you crazy??? I use two cars too. Once i forgot to switch the car over and my pax was hesitant to get it. I couldn't blame her but i told her watch i will cancel your ride and you will just have to redo the request. I canceled and she got the notification immediately. She said OK now will i still give her a ride? I asked her to request it and she  did but another car 15 minutes away took the request. I drove away ok with it. Uber already hires sex offenders, 7 year old DUI, convicted felons who served time and a little bit of good drivers . 
So there is a 50/50 chance that you will make it to your destination regardless of the car or plate number ."
Uber drivers in New York City...what are your opinions on TLC's rules and regulations?,5,23.39298895737087,uber,"In the wake of AB5 in California, that has spurred my interest in New York City's rules and regulations. Uber drivers in New York, how have you been effected after the laws have passed?","TLC actually did a good thing and are getting slack by Uber. You essentially had an unlimited number of cars and drivers - where take home pay has dropped by more than 50% from 5 years ago. 

Uber is at fault, from congestion to bike accidents. You cannot insert 80-100k cars in a few years, reduce the speed limit, and reduce the number of lanes by creating bike lanes and expect traffic to move smoothly.

In the short term we, as drivers, will see lockouts within regions, where we are unable to login if there is not enough demand beginning tomorrow 9/17.

Today 9/16 we also saw a major change in surge pricing. It changed from a multiplier (1.3x, 1.5x, 1.7x, etc.) to a fixed bonus such as $1.50, $5, $9, etc. This second part is extremely troubling because we are doing the brunt of the work yet we will receive less than majority of the take home. 

I estimated a few fares by comparing the driver app and passenger app. I have seen estimates of rides for $165 rider pay, yet driver pay with a $6 bonus would be $65. On the previous pay structure our earnings would've been $99 - $132 based on a 60-80% of the payment. Another point is if we use the most efficient route we are paid less! If we take the longest route we are paid more, our earnings should not be tied in that manner. If we get you there quicker and there is a great variance between payment and earnings either the passenger should be refunded for the extra time or miles they paid, or the driver should receive those earnings as they chose a more efficient route than Uber. 

Thank you for asking the question, I hope you guys pay attention to this market, it is extremely unfair for a large company to hire 100k drivers without thinking longevity. Riders have options in which companies they would like to support, and creating this dialogue helps. 

This also is not TLC's fault it is Uber for hiring an unlimited amount of drivers, registering an unlimited amount of cars, and by offering $1000-$2500 sign on bonuses and guaranteeing 10k monthly to drivers in the beginning."

Anyway the driver definitely wasn’t trying to kill cyclist. It was an accident! All I see is no 1 dumb person , accidentally hitting no 2 dumb person

Car vs bicycle.. bicycle always lose 

Both should have more cautious , and if bicycle using pedestrian crossing , aren’t they supposed to walk it instead of ride it? Bicycle riders like to tell people to share the road. But they ride like they own the road. Trying to kill is a little mellow dramatic. I would say uber driving like an idiot hits cyclists. I feel that would be more accurate.  Really sucks though hope the biker was ok and the driver had insurance. You seem to want to take your anger out on others. I do hope that you recover quickly and like I said on that person's insurance. Was the driver a dumbass? Yes. Was the bicycle Rider a double dumbass? YES!

Would you take this round-trip? (First Uber),12,24.426912568586847,uber,"Hey, 

My car is out of commission for the moment. I want to take an hour ride to pick up a new pet (8 week old rabbit). I would enter the car with a clean pet carrier. 

I'd pick the rabbit up, put in carrier and go home. 

An hour drive both ways. 

A problem I can foresee is the driver may have to wait more than three minutes. If I give a $20 tip, would that be sufficient? It could take from three to ten minutes. I'd give another tip on arrival at home, at least $10, possibly more. 

Also, should I give the driver cash for tolls? It's 2 bucks in both directions. Or are the tips enough?","Rabbits piss all over the place when they are scared or upset. Make sure to bring a couple towels (or 1 really thick one).  Rabbits pee and poop very frequently.  The poop is basically odorless, but the pee can sometimes smell a bit, so maybe bring a small air freshener if you can.  Overall, I'd take it.  I used to volunteer at the Humane Society specifically working with rabbits, so it would be a pleasure for me. Tip in cash. Don’t promise to do it in the app because 90% of the time riders are lying. 

I thought tolls get covered through the app? If you have a toll transponder, you could have him use that instead. Driver here; Absolutely. Even if your market has really bad rates, the $20 tip makes up for it. Absolutely!! Youll be fine, driver will be happy to get a return trip home so he doesnt have to drive an hour back empty handed. An hour each way? That would be fine, especially since it's a round trip, the driver will be happy to have a passenger for every mile. And especially with that tip. Would take that trip in a heartbeat, but only if I get to pet the rabbit.

I would expect that a new profile starts fresh with a 5 star rating. Good luck being a model passenger! Congrats on your sobriety, but you are waaaay overthinking this! All we drivers see is your rating, not how you got it. No driver will know you puked in a car, unless you tell them.

Make sure you've set up trusted contacts in the settings. Make sure you're at the pin and not somewhere else. Some drivers will cancel on you if you aren't where you should be. Make sure you get in the right car. Same like taxi 

They are Human being and not robot,  Treat them like your friend Play with the app before you use it, and watch some YouTube vids. If you have used google maps or something similar you will be fine. Be cordial to the driver but if they’re not really talking back don’t force it and enjoy the ride :) Put a payment method in before you go on your trip. You don't want to have to deal with it on the spot, especially when you are trying to catch a train. I took Uber after a concert in Worcester, MA a few weeks ago for a concert. My advice would be to set a payment setting beforehand and save it in the app. Concerts and other events (as such) act differently than other pick up spots. Concerts guaranteed you’re not going to be the only one getting Uber or Lyft. I remembered jumping on the Uber app right as soon as the concert ended, but the driver decided to park nearly a block away and I saw the “5 minute pick up warning” because it was so crowded. Also, because you’re going to a train station, you may need to leave early. It’s good to have cash on hand for a tip or have extra in the method you’re paying with via app. Just be waiting on the curb when he arrives, you can see his exact position on the map so you'll know when he's getting close. Hop in the back, say ""hey hows it goin?"" and just sit back and relax. If he's cool and his car doesnt smell like shit throw em a couple of bucks as a tip in the app. Tip the driver minimum 10$ and sit in the front [deleted]"
Don't get an Uber GiftCard and don't ever expect Uber to help you,29,25.58481766125118,uber,"I'm disabled and had to move on the first of September.

Either way uber will cost about $60. So a friend of mine, in the US, sends me an Uber Gift Card. I check the uber website and support to see if I can still use an American gift card in Canada and no problem. So I attached it. Popped on without an issue and showed me all the credits. 


Until I tried to use it the next day when I moved anyway. 


Apparently the currency is locked to the country its issued in, but both Uber support and the uber support website said that the currency would automatically convert. 

I had $65 left for the month to get groceries. Then it was all gone. I've got no food, no groceries, no nothing. 


I have been arguing with Uber Support for two weeks now and they refuse to do anything. Just constantly copy and pasting the same answer. This in and of itself is infuriating but what makes it worse? They actually told me, uber support themselves, that they will convert the currency and always could. So I ask them to do so and then I get paired with another clueless fucking moron who just pastes the same answer I've gotten a thousand times. 


They're breaking promises constantly. Their own website refuses to have any clarity. They are lying through their teeth via support (sorry sir but Uber has zero phone lines meanwhile they have like 10 but whatever). They could EASILY give me credits that add up to the currency. Not even converted with the extra few bucks. They could just give me the credits for my account and call it a day and they refuse to. Every day they paste the same answer. Every other day they say they'll help before going back to ignoring me. 


I am literally starving to death because Uber has some of the worst websites and support of any company around. They break promises and they do not care about you as a customer and they have already shown they don't give a fuck about riders too. 

I am going to die from being unable to eat and it will be Ubers fault and I hope to fuck that whoever finds my withered and good starved corpse decides to sue the goddamn fuck out of them. 

Heres an example of the shit they're pulling. This was with the guy who bought me the gift card. We're both trying to figure this out. [First photo ](https://i.imgur.com/Qyvr0Y8.jpg)

This was one message. The promise they're refusing to keep. 

Thanks for reaching out, Matthew.

Edit: Same copy pasted message. ""as we have explained we cannot convert currency"". But as they explained they also can convert currency. I'm having a mental breakdown over this. I have ptsd already from being gaslit and abused my entire life and now a fucking company is trying to starve me to death by not honoring a promise that they made themselves. The last time I had someone constantly change story like this it was my narcissistic psychopathic mother. And as stupid as all of this is, I can't sleep. I have ptsd I've been trying to cope with for years and uber has perfectly tapped into it by starving me, lying to me, stealing from me and then making me think I'm crazy by saying they never offered it in the first place. I just want to eat. I just want to eat.


**Edit 2: Thanks for all the private messages calling me a piece of shit or a loser pax. All I wanted was to vent because uber has been saying one thing then another for two weeks and starving me. I would not be in this position if they simply told me what the fuck would happen to begin with. We would have avoided all of it and just gone with PayPal. But I post this here and all I get are downvotes and private messages telling me to kill myself or I deserve to starve to death. Fine. Thanks. Thanks so much. That's really what I needed to hear when I am not sleeping and already dealing with intense stress and anxiety from life, never mind this shit too. Thanks so fucking much.**","While this is a shitty situation, it sounds like all your issues could have been avoided had you and your friend read the fine print. 

I am an American who crosses into Canada fairly often and I do buy Uber gift cards from grocery stores for family and friends.

On the back of those gift cards, just like other companies such as McDonald's and Chipotle that have Canadian locations, it clearly states that the value is only good for use in the US only. I'm not sure where you found the information that Uber gift cards convert to your local currency because they've never worked like that in the past. Even now on the page about gift cards, it clearly states that ""Uber gift cards can be only used for rides or UberEATS orders in the country where the gift card was purchased."" (https://www.uber.com/us/en/gift-cards/)

The support agent is likely confused at what you are asking about if they told you the gift card amount will convert. AFAIK there aren't even any tools available for them to convert the currency for you, all they could do is give you a goodwill credit in the currency you want without removing the USD amount, but they probably don't have authorization for such a high amount. I’m a driver, and occasional passenger.  I’m so sorry to hear about this. 

Sadly, I’m not surprised.  Uber and Lyft truly think they can code their way out of actual human interaction.  They think they’re software companies, but people think they’re actual transportation companies.  And that mismatch sometimes has horrible consequences.

I know money is extremely tight, but is there an Uber hub in your town?  They do have actual humans that work there.  I can’t promise they would actually help, but you would be speaking with an actual Uber employee. 

But, overall, yeah.  Don’t expect Uber to help.  We drivers don’t.  Uber is great for bar runs and airport rides and the occasional work commute.  But relying on it?   Ugh. Wow maybe this life isn't for you.. Yeah I also knew that already. I honestly thought everyone knew this hopefully more people read this post to get properly informed. Just so you know in the future to keep yourself from going insane know that you are most likely having a conversation with a chat bot and not a human.

Uber uses a automated support system thast scans your messages for keywords and then uses canned responses to respond to those keywords.

The majority of the time you need to send at least 5 messages on the same subject before it gets routed to an actual human to take a look.

Also remember that you are not Uber's customer according to them. The driver is their actual customer so they don't give two shits about you.

Your best course of action is to blow up their Twitter account with your story.

p.s. don't take any responses you receive to heart. It's the Internet. Can you sell the remaining balance on the card or it’s just a Top up kinda of thing?

Ask uber to take it from the gift card , and dispute it with your bank. They deserve it . Psychic Vampire Uber cash is a sham. Every week someone's on here with a tirade about how Uber stole their Uber cash. Seriously though, why do people use gift cards instead of giving cash anymore???   Cash shows you care, gift cards shows you are lazy.  Only assholes give gift cards. 

Pretty much everyone has zelle quick pay. Just transfer money for free or give cash.   

Have your friend do a chargeback on the gift card and transfer you the money."
Tipping Uber drivers,46,25.712468124225182,uber,"When Uber first launched, not needing to tip was part of the pitch. That was fine at the time, as rides cost $4 per mile, you got black car service, and Uber only kept 20% of the fare. Now, rides cost about $1 per mile and Uber can take more than 60% on some rides. 

Look, ALL of us drivers would prefer to return to the original rates without tips rather than have to deal with tipping, but it is now true that we often earn less than minimum wage on a trip, while you get a ride at 1/4th the cost. When you ask me to stop at a convenience store or a drive-thru and the wheels aren't turning, I'm making less than 70% of  minimum wage ( 12.75 cents per minute, or $7.65 an hour).  So please stop using this talking point as an excuse for not tipping because after the expenses of operating our vehicles we're earning starvation wages while you are paying 1/4th of what you did when Uber told you not to tip. 

The position of ""I don't tip because Uber once told me I didn't have to"" sounds a lot like ""I don't tip waiters because restaurants used to pay their wait-staff enough to live."" 

I've seen people on here say ""I tip waiters because employers are legally allowed to pay them less than minimum wage"". Guess what: We're not legally required to be paid anything, and what you pay for a ride is nowhere near what we actually receive. We can often earn less than minimum wage AND have to bear the brunt of gas costs, maintenance costs, and depreciation. 

Now, are all drivers ENTITLED to a tip? Of course not. All I ask is that you consider that we, like servers, earn less than minimum wage in hopes that generous riders will give tips to make up for the sub-minimum wage earnings. Just like you do with your server.","I have been using Uber since the beginning, and I loved the seamlessness of the process (a big selling point for me over traditional cabs) but the idea that the driver was being properly compensated was part of my faith in their algorithm.  I was happy and the drivers I spoke to seemed happy.  The idea they promoted was likely always a dream, and the current state of affairs is a product of that falsehood.  Drivers are justifiably angry and riders are angry because the experience is so diminished by the myriad complications of what's on offer and how much it costs.  It's Uber that sucks, they should be the focus of our dissatisfaction and not each other.  When I read that the company doesn't view the drivers as ""core to their business model"" and therefore not worthy of employee status, I thought, well fuck you Uber, you diminish your drivers and your passengers with that garbage. I don’t mind tipping but it seems like many drivers here forget that the tip is commensurate with the quality of service. 

Excellent service merits 20% or more

Good service merits 18%

You annoyed me or inconvenienced me (went to wrong pick-up or dropped me off on the wrong side of the road) merits 15%

Shitty service (offensive music when my son is in the car or taking a wring turn that add significant time to the trip) merits 10% or less >while you get a ride at 1/4th the cost

This is simply not true. The cost of each ride is only going up for the riders over time.

&#x200B;

While I am an American man who carries cash solely for the purpose of tipping, this OP sounds fairly entitled. If Ubering makes you less than minimum wage *before* even considering the cost of your vehicle upkeep, then the logical thing to do is to get out of it and get another replacement job. 

When you do not, and instead you complain to others around you and online, I question your sanity. Or, more likely, it tells me that what you claim is probably not true and/or Ubering is still the best gig available to you at those hours and rate. You do realize that tipping is almost an exclusively American thing? I doubt you’d feel entitled to tips if you weren’t from America. Here’s where people are getting this confused:

Uber NEVER said there was no need to tip, they said the tip was included. They were not at all saying it’s not expected or normal to tip, just that they were taking care of it for you.

This was false and they were sued and settled for $100M. They no longer make this false claim and have added in-app tipping to reflect the fact that it is not included and is expected.

Tipping personal drivers for satisfactory service is the norm and custom in the US and is considered a normal part of fair compensation for that service. Like it, don’t like it, it doesn’t matter. It is expected that when you accept a tipped service you will tip. Anything less is an insult and theft of that service.

Read any etiquette article on tipping Uber drivers and they all agree it is expected and only optional in the sense that if the service is completely unsatisfactory you can voice your dissatisfaction by not tipping or tipping less. I have better luck with Lyft, which I use primarily. We seem to have better quality customers, and very seldom does someone not tip me. I'm not doing it to make a killing, but overall, Lyft seems to take better care of their contractors and hold customers to a higher standard (where I live, anyway). I don't expect a tip every time but I think overall, people realize that we use our own vehicles and are very grateful that we're willing to serve them. They take care of us. Uber is fine with giving starvation wages do drivers.  I was taking Ubers in Egypt and car breaking down, yet Uber still charged me.  I paid around $3 and drivers there got a fraction of it as it is egypt. Some rides were like $1.75 that I paid Uber is fine with giving starvation wages do drivers.  I was taking Ubers in Egypt and car breaking down, yet Uber still charged me.  I paid around $3 and drivers there got a fraction of it as it is egypt. Some rides were like $1.75 that I paid.  Alexandria HBE airport was 1+ hour away from city and I only paid $13.  Driver prolly got $6 Uber is supposed to be a side gig, not a full time job. Rather than blame the customers, wouldnt it make sense to find an actual job?"
uber charge,5,25.754181087188144,uber,do you pay upfront for your ride? what happens if there’s traffic do they charge you extra or do they account for that from the start?,"I believe in most US markets Uber uses upfront pricing where you are given a breakdown of the cost upfront before requesting the ride. 

You will not be charged more than the quoted price unless you do something to alter the ride such as adding a stop or changing the destination.

They account for traffic upfront when they quote you the price. It depends on where and when you order a ride.

In my market, Houston, it’s an ESTIMATE or how much it will cost. It usually does a decent job of giving you an about right number, but I’d say a 10% swing up and maybe down is not unheard of. The way this works is they guess you will take X route, and they think that route will take a usually reasonable amount of time. 

So that route takes X miles and will take Y mins. 

Uber charges you by the mile, and also by the min, plus a set of base fees with a minimum total fare. 

So if you go 10 miles over 10 mins, and the fare is 80¢ a mile, 20¢ a min, and a $3.50 pickup fee, then your fare is 10x0.80 + 10x0.20 + 3.50 = $13.50

If traffic is bad and the time doubles, 
10x0.80 + 20x0.20 + 3.50 = $15.50

And if the driver takes a different route that is quicker than the gridlocked road, but a little farther, 11x0.80 + 11x0.20 + 3.50 = $14.50

So theses not a whole lot of change if you are going one way or another other than the amount of time spent in a car. And most drivers want to keep that time element down as much as they can because they make money by doing more rides and not sitting around. 

There have been a few times I’ve been in other cities, NYC for example, where at certain times they had a “fare protection” or language to the effect of “you won’t be charged more than $XX.xx for your trip as long as you don’t add stops or change your destination. 

To do this, it felt like they padded the cost of the ride and fixed the price. 

So in the first example, they took what they thought was a $13.50 ride, added $1.30 to it and said $14.80 is the most you will pay. 

Here are a few extra things you will pay for

Tolls, if you go a tollway you pay the eztag rate.

The charge for Waiting, if you take your time getting to the car once they have arrived, they charge you to wait it’s 6¢ a min more in my market, so not enough to make me want to sit there any longer than the required 5 mins, so save money and make your driver happier by being ready to go BEFORE YOU ORDER your ride. Also be outside ready to go so we can find you. 

Canceling a ride after 2 mins from when you ordered the ride will charge you a fee, this also happens if I reach your pickup and you aren’t ready to go within 5 mins. Notice I said ready to go. A common trick passengers try to pull on drivers is they wait 4:00-4:30 after I arrive to come out and one finger wait you to try to get you to stay after 5 mins of waiting. 👆🏻

This usually doesn’t work for me because unless it is in the middle of the day and rides are 5+ mins apart or you have a really long ride, I have no incentive to stay, I cancel the ride collect my $3.75, and usually within a min or two, I get another ride. Pay me a dollar a min in cash, upfront, and I’ll stay all week if you want. 

Also, between pickup and drop off location, people put more effort into drop off location than they need to and no effort into pickup. 

The pickup location is way more important than drop off. If I can’t find you, where your going doesn’t matter, and when it comes to dropping off, if the pin is 50 feet the wrong direction, it won’t matter. 

But if you set your location as where your bedroom is, I may be sent to the street behind your house, and depending on how big a pain in the ass it is, and if I know the drop off is probably less money than completing the trip, I may just sit there and collect a cancelation fee. 

This is the reality of low cost car fares, we don’t make much money so we have to look at our bottom line. 

Hope that helps. I believe the price you see is considered an estimate. It take in to consideration charges like tolls. Driver here. That price is the price for the route that Uber thinks the driver should take. Uber is very bad at estimating traffic or even routes that make sense. Some drivers follow that route, because that is the route you pay for, and we get paid for the route we drive. They may charge you more, but seldom will they charge less. It all depends on how rich you are and what zip code and what street you live on ."

We have noticed that many times our rides are similar prices - mine are never exactly 50% less than hers.

Can anyone corroborate this or am I crazy?"," They will add  200% surge and give you a 50% discount . Just do the math yourself . They charge different people different prices based on what their algorithm says you'll pay. You get discounted rates at elevated prices 

So it’s a lose for ya A machine learning algorithm determines your price based on data it has about your behavior.

The algorithm puts you in a demographic with others who have similar discounts when determining what to charge you.

Surprise, the price goes back up because - amazing! Elevated pricing in your demographic seems to increase revenue regardless that it also drives down bookings."
Thanks Uber for the nice PT income. I hope it doesn’t go “employer” in my state.,17,26.15553525387965,uber,Image,"I drove FT Uber for the longest time, found a FT gig with my previous employer though so went to just PT Uber. 

I work M-F, 5am-1:30pm.  Make 18 bucks an hour with full paid benefits (been with the company for over 20,000 hours, also get very good PTO). 

Anyways, I was a store manager making 63k. Grocery store. Anyone in grocery knows the hours are all over the place, you deal with crap constantly from the top and bottom. I was doing close to 60-65 hours every week, 6 days a week in the store sometimes and then dealing with emails constantly from home. 

Uber allowed me to jump off the cliff. I went FT for awhile but saw Uber was just as shitty sometimes as my salaried job. 

The mix has been great though. 

Full benefits, 18 an hour gives me 720 per week. 
Uber gives me 350-600 in just 10-14 hours. Combined it’s around 65k plus. 

So working less hours, getting paid just as much to more now, and the toughest part of any of my work is showing up.  I’m at the lowest level in the company with very easy responsibilities.  I never take work home with me. No conference calls on my weekends off. Can watch my son play football every Friday night and spend time with my teacher wife on the weekends. 

Thanks Uber! So your other FT job suck? Watch UBER hiring ads on daytime tv during airing of Maury Povich and Jerry Springer show .  Uber is hiring on Reddit now ? What happened to Craigslist and daytime tv ?

Strange Uber Experience,18,26.28293108721298,uber,"I signed up for Uber as a rider over a year ago, however I never purchased a ride. Today, my battery died at Walmart so I opened the Uber app to order a ride. The app asked me to log in, then asked for my card details again. I provided everything. Then it took me to the ride creation screen, and I set up a ride. When I hit the ""confirm"" button, the app popped up a message stating my account is disabled.

When I got home, I went through the help menus, entered my info to reactivate and the site said someone would contact me shortly. This was hours ago. I haven't heard from anyone and there's no way to contact customer service directly.

Has anyone else had this experience? I'm kind of surprised this happened and not sure why.","Fraud prevention. They are too busy and they have an avoid customer service center. I have never seen ""Walmart"" used as a verb before.

Bravo!"
Worst idea of my life: Buying a car to do Uber,17,26.291553772409205,uber,"So I bought a brand new car. An Uber Black!

First 4 months I struggled to break even, but this month I got banned because I asked a customer to get out of my car because he refused to stop eating. He tried to call the cops on me, but they take around 40 minutes to show up in my country, so I waited for him to get out of the car. I thought that was the end of it, but to my dismay I discovered he had made up a tale about me having a weapon on the car and my account is gone. Forever.

I sent messages but got automated replies. Went to the Uber office in person, but the guy over there hinted that they were not going to do anything about it.

So now I'm stuck with a ton of bills, an expensive car, and no income. Do yourself a favor and find a job while you still can. What happened to me could happen to anyone, and you're not gonna be happy about it.","He eating food in your Black car is definitely in your right to kick his ass out or her ass out.  Uber lately loves to side with customers.  Why drive for company that deactivates innocent drivers who excercise their right to be independent contractor? It is their own vehicle after all, Uber needs to be sued for this.  We need to show who is Boss.  Airbnb has done similar things to hosts where if a customer lies and says ""Host came into house while I was inside"", they permanently deactivate. Just do food delivery man, that way customers can't disrespect you inside your own car.

Uber wants black car drivers to maintain squeeky clean inside of car and yet Uber deactivates driver who kicks passenger out for eating.  Wow Jesus man I'm sorry.  I was vocal to people on this sub who where asking question about buying a car for uber. Everyone downvoted me and this is what I was trying to prevent. Not even to sure if you can sue, I doubt you can. If I do uber black , I will def let the customer eat in my car .. he is paying $$$$

Hell I’ll be his best friend and make him as a client on the side 

Uber black is rare , and cost like 4-5 times of regular Uber 

On the downside , sorry this happens to you , maybe you can do lyft now? Dashcam? You can sue Uber , if you feel you were mistreated unfairly . Else just let it go . Terrible break but I'm sure you will bounce back. Here in Chicago, Ill., Uber has an arrangement with Hertz car rental so that people like myself who don't have a personal vehicle can still drive. But it is not cheap and it seems that it is getting more difficult every day to break even."
(Rant) Keep getting bad passenger ratings. Fed up with it and decided to uninstall Uber.,10,26.408232013158223,uber,"This post is a rant and is not meant to be constructive. Hate on me all you want; I'm out of fucks to give.

I rarely use Uber. When I do, I always make sure to wait for the driver at the designated spot so they never have to wait for me. I greet the driver. I don't slam doors. I have never used Uber as a designated driver because I was drunk. I always ride alone without any loud/drunk friends. I have always tipped $5 cash minimum for every single ride (up to $10 cash for longer rides, which I think is very generous). I never talk on the phone. I never ask the driver to change any of their car settings (A/C, radio, etc.). I'm presentable and don't wear any heavy cologne. I never eat or drink in their car and make a mess. Literally all I do is exist in the backseat and make small talk if the driver chooses to start a conversation. If I talk with the driver, I specifically avoid talking about controversial topics.

Yet like clockwork every time my rating gets back up to a 4.7-4.8, I get random 1 star ratings that drag it down to 4.3-4.4. Like seriously? What the fuck else do you want out of me? Fuck you. I hope software automates your jobs away. I can't wait for Uber to introduce self-driving cars and gets rid of all the drivers so I don't have to deal with ungrateful drivers. I wouldn't have to tip them so goddamn much just so they can leave me a 1 star rating. I also hope the law that reclassifies you as employees fails so that you don't get your benefits. 

Oh, by the way: even if you can ""force"" Uber to pay you more with benefits, the situation would be untenable. Uber is already unprofitable and just laid off a bunch of engineers recently. Do you think they could really go more into the red to pay you more? The company would either go belly-up at that point or heavily invest in self-driving technology to replace you ASAP.

In the meantime, I'm probably just gonna use Lyft or even just go back to taxicabs. I'll probably use taxis so I can avoid the overlapping shit drivers on Lyft who also drive on Uber. I don't even care if it's more expensive. I use ridesharing infrequently enough where it doesn't matter. Though the majority of drivers probably give me 5 stars, the number of drivers who give me 1 star is significant enough where it just ruins the whole experience.","You probably smell bad. Aside from the bruised ego, what’s the impact of the ratings to you?

Your habits sound very nice.  But almost all my passengers do not act as considerate as you, but their ratings are higher. So??? You know most Uber Drivers are also Lyft drivers right?

I’d also say this, there are a few variables that are not talked about here, destination and when, I know if someone wants to go 20 miles away from the bars 10 mins before closing time and surge hours hit, you are a lot higher probability than most to be rated low. Same goes for taking rides where the opposite direction is always traffic. Say you live downtown and work in the suburbs and get a ride at 8:30am. That return in traffic where there are no rides back and you get stuck suck. 

But if you really do tip $5+ in cash every trip, I’d expect your rating to be high. Cash buys back a lot of sins. 

The only other thing is if you give off a bad additude or demeaning interactions. 

Also, if it feels like a passenger is going to give a 1* most drivers rate a preemptive 1* back. Lol doesnt matter man. Uber and Lyfts business is not sustainable unless they raise prices on you guys. 
Some of these drivers out here aint shit to be honest. Tell 'em why you mad, son!! I’m having the same issue, my rating was originally 5.0 for months, then 4.98, 4,96 and now it’s 4.89. I talk when the driver talks, I never ask the driver to change the radio station or give other demands. I always take a shower before leaving for work so the whole “smell bad” joke is a no go. I’m usually quiet in the back just minding my business. Why do you care so much about your rating? It literally doesn't mean anything. We couldn't even see passenger ratings in Chicago until like a month ago and even now we can't see them until after we accepted the ride anyway. Bro start torching others ratings. At least you will be content . This isn't a job. It is a gig."
Is uber good enough to make a income to support a family of 3?,14,26.478069976121187,uber,,"No one can answer this.

It depends on the rates and demand in your market and how and when you will drive.

But if there is a will, strategy & market there is a way No. They will close your account if you piss off even one customer. This is the wrong place for advice like that. If anything I would suggest getting signed up and while your out dashing, look for something much more stable. Had a buddy of mine sell this shit to me, come to find out doordash pays people to do that. Might start out good, but in the long run. You will be sitting around waiting awhile for an order and with this new pay model it gets worse. Best case you might make $20hr a few times, but the normal will be much lower. Lately I'll go out and knock out 2 orders and then sit for 30m before anything comes in. Not to mention if doordash's app is completely unstable and goes down often. These past weekends I'll work 11am-8pm and end up with 80-100 before gas. Probably not.  It highly depends on what market you are in and when and where you drive, and how good you are at playing this game.  You could probably only make this work IF you are in a top 5 market like SF.

If it was a $10 ride, they pre authorize $15 so if you ask the driver to make 2 extra stops and go 5 miles out of the way, or if traffic is bad, they don’t get stiffed the extra money. 

After they complete the ride, if the charge ends up being $11, they run the charge for $11, and you will see the first charge fall off in a day or two. You only get charged for the actual fare. I’m confused by your explanation.  Specifically, what do you mean the taxi fare was actually £11?  When I ride, I only know what they charge me (£13 in your case). The more you use uber the more it rips you off. It’s like a parasite . Try the competition."
Well that’s a new one,55,26.693579235416323,uber,Image,"This is what happens when you buy a base model. No nav, no leather, no windows, no tires, and no seatbelts.... Looks like they wanted a free trip and may have gotten it. Yup, that’s right. No seatbelts in the car and yet this is the first time anyone mentioned it. Holy fuck, do they accept into CS only those with negative IQ?! If you option for a car with no seat belts you can't be ticketed for not wearing them, you're a genius OP. /s lol

&#x200B;

There should be an accelerated court for obvious shit like this. You just walk in and show this message, the judge informs the Uber representative that seat belts have been federally mandated equipment since 1968, and asks them if they have proof that the seat belts have been removed, Uber says no. The judge awards a wages lost compensation for the time of deactivation and some amount for damages, whatever total is awarded from Uber is the same amount awarded from the lying PAX to the driver. They wouldn't do this shit if that was the way things went. That is in a perfect world though where you can't force workers to use arbitration and having billions of dollars doesn't mean things are more fair for you. Im sorry man but this is hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂 Do you know what would END all of this shit?   


If Uber/Lyft just required that any passenger who felt unsafe, or had missing seatbelts or felt their driver was drunk/high CANCELLED the ride and exited the vehicle. That's it. just cancel the ride, the driver is not getting paid anymore so he/she has no more incentive to drive you and will pull over and let you out and then you can call another ride and file a grievance with the company.   


Except... No. One. Ever. Does. That.   


Why?   


Because these are scams looking for free rides, that's why. I don't Uber, and I don't Toyota. Can someone please explain. Take your seats out and make them sit on milk crates. I actually literally had that problem in Costa Rica, those guys for some reason tuck the seatbelts away I had a passenger, they had a guest with them. They got into my car, I did the usual niceties, the guests in the back right away said your seat belts are broke. I said so nicely, no sir my seatbelt is not broke, you need to move your booty over and then you will find the fastener. I thought to myself as soon as they got in they were looking for something so that they could try to get a free credit on the ride. Ok, how can they prove this? Accusations are accusations... This isn’t new. A friend of mine got a message From Uber telling him a passenger he picked reported that all seatbelts in the car was broken.  You just have to upload pictures of the seatbelts to get your vehicle reactivated. Some Passengers are going nuts !!! Happen to me before during a busy holiday. Fucking losers. Lost 2 days of work until I was able to take my car to the Uber hub. Fuck these people. Had someone tell me that my seatbelt wasn't working in my 2016 Lexus the other day.  I replied, ""I think you're using the receiver for the center belt, which I believe is different than the one for your side.""  Yep. Send a pic to Uber of you strangling that passenger with a seatbelt. It happened to me in Lyft. They cancelled my driver status. I’m full time on Uber. Trust me Lyft is the crappiest of them all. Stupid rating system How is this even possible ? They are the ones who inspected the car to begin with. Let me guess beige seats lol Is it possible the clicky part was under the seat or tucked in the crack? Did somebody put your passenger cabin seats down and then put them back up? Some cars, the shoulder belt gets stuck behind the seat. Blind passenger?"

Question for drivers one star rating.,24,27.293521365070784,uber,"So is it possible to challenge or contest a one star rating? Reason being this woman had to get a ride to mail a package back and it was marked for one way. Upon arrival this woman (I had already completed out the trip when she was getting out and she saw this) states upon closing my door that she needed to mail this back, and find a manager to file a complaint on two drivers and shouldn’t be longer then 20 minutes and will need me to take her back and shut the door. I received a new ride request accepted and went on my way. What are your thoughts on this and am I able to argue that one star as it brought my rating to 4.87. It was one of the most ridiculous and rude displays of entitlement I have ever seen.","they arent going to do anything about it. keep on driving and your rating will go back up. Ratings dont affect your pay, a person with 5 stars will earn the same rate as 4 star driver. Theyre imaginary points, just like reddit upvotes. It’s not possible to challenge the rating unfortunately. I’ve tried a couple of times in the past for valid reasons where I’ve had to report the rider and I get the usual canned message BS.

Yes the rating does matter if it gets too low but as long as you’re at or above 4.85 you can qualify for Pro. Not sure what rating below that gets you at risk for suspension but it would probably take several more one stars which are unlikely if you’re a decent driver. You should just ignore this incident and move on eventually the bad ratings will drop off. Eh, get used to it. Believe it or not there ARE even dumber reasons to get a 1 star, trust me. Unfortunately once the rating has been given Uber will not change it. The other side of this is that you really should stop caring about your rating. Obviously keep an eye on it so you can continue to work but it’s just part of the job. Ignore the tabloids as they say. I'm not an Uber driver myself, but I know one. He and other Uber drivers I've had are usually interested in learning the flip side- like, they don't know that we can see them making u-turns, missing streets, etc. Feedback can be helpful, that's why ratings are a thing.

I've been told riders get rated by their Uber drivers, too- makes sense. I'll get an Uber driver rated for ""outstanding service"", yet has a 4.9/5 rating. That is that one jerk they picked up that wasn't happy about something. I work in the service industry myself- at a restaurant, to be specific. You can't please everyone all of the time. You can do your job perfectly, and you will inevitably get that one person who complains.

 Take a look on Yelp. Have you ever seen a restaurant with a perfect rating? Probably not. And if you do? They're probably operating a cheap ""massage parlour"" in the back. And the reviews are written by the owners. 

The takeaway is- don't sweat it. I've never cancelled a ride because my driver had a 4.2 rating. You've got to account for a percentage of assholish-ness. It's just part of the job. A well-run restaurant actually factors that in to their costs (but they call it something nicer that assholish-ness). Imma give you some next level shit that will blow ya mind. Ya ready, homie?

# RATINGS DON’T MATTER

You got a 1 Star. Big whoop. No need to fight about it. Take it. Live it. Love it. You know when you need to worry? When you start getting *multiple* 1 Stars, then it’s time to worry. In the mean time, live your life. Have a beer, smoke a J, whatever gets you off, mmkay?

And btw, you’re not a *real* driver until you get 1 starred, so welcome to the club, brother! Ratings are there to control drivers and give a false sense of safety for riders . Ratings are not transparent and never will be .
Google maps , yelp allow business owners to to remove negative ratings for a fee .  Open google and yelp , there are some ratings excluded saying it’s not relevant or it don’t meet the quality standard . There are too many headless idiots rating drivers negatively without cause or reason. 
If they allow all the ratings bad drivers will be gone in a week . That’s why last 500 is so ambiguous. No, Uber will say ""We are transparent and we can't change your rating"", even if it is clearly unfair as day light. I contacted Uber about a rating / report when I had to end a ride on a passenger that left drugs in my car while he made a delivery. Uber's response was ""your rating will even out"". In other words, no, Uber doesn't give a crap. Happens a lot. I never wait, even when they use the multiple stop feature. When all pax exit the vehicle, the ride is over. They can tate you 1 star for any reason. It's their prerogative I got 

5 star    478
4 star    13
3 star.    4
2 star.    2
1 Star     3

This is during 9 months ubering ... 

Now is at 4.92

Which is still high 

But now I kinda know what to give rider their ratings , and I’m pretty generous with 3,2,1 star if they are acting like it 

Most of the times is “karen”, obnoxious frat kids, rude people, people who ask me to stop at gas station and didn’t tip cash , people who kept me waiting too long for pick up 

And I do cancel a lot of them during bar rush when they aren’t at the spot or non responding to text

Keep your heads up !! Being a driver you will get 1 Star for a lot of ridiculous stuff, but since you will have more 5 star , it’ll even out .. unless you being a dick or drive crazy you should be fine !! If you 1 Star her and explain.  1 Star automatically blocks that user or driver from ever coming up again. Move on with life. I guess you always got a trophy growing up. Real world ain't that way. Sometimes you don't get a trophy even if you deserve one."
California Is Jeopardizing Uber And Lyft Business Model,9,27.57069729100775,uber,Image,">California is Jeopardizing Future for Uber and Lyft Driving

App should cut drivers off after a certain amount of time if they want to stay 1099. Or they have the option of becoming W2 employees that have to drive a minimum of hours, but get benefits and can get fired. Hahaha business model of 5 cents a mile exploitation? Fuck off with this shit seriously."

This is a bad idea California, let’s go back to 18th century and ride on them horse carriages. AHHAHAHAHAH. Okay California time to bust in with the feds and start rounding these fools up. They think are above the law."
Why is my rider rating low?,18,27.890488957685452,uber,"I very rarely use Uber because I live in a small city where it is not available. I used it only in periods where I was in London and Paris. For a long time, after use in Paris, I had a 5.0 rating through all rides. It was all good. I tipped every ride and was polite. You’d think it’d be Paris I’d have issues with because my French is not great so we had some difficulty communicating, but no. Then I used it for a while in London. After spending this time in London, I check back on Uber and my rating is at 3.6. I don’t understand what happened because on my end, my rides seemed to be pleasant. I tip, I don’t talk on the phone, I’m usually alone, I don’t slam doors, I’m presentable. I’m a very introverted and shy person so I don’t act out and only make conversation when it’s initiated with me. I really don’t get what I could have done so wrong on more than one ride. I only had one problematic occasion where I knew I’d get an awful rating because my mom who was angry happened to be with me and was screaming on the phone at someone for the entire ride. I get that. Was embarrassed. But could that one ride bring the score down by that much? Is it because I rarely use it? What is there that drivers hate that I may have been unintentionally doing? I don’t often use Uber so maybe I’m being ignorant of some rules. Any advice welcome :)

Edit: Just to add and clarify that I don’t smoke or drink. I have OCD and am very careful and obsessive about cleanliness and hygiene. I wear light perfume + deodorant, only clean smart clothes, and also naturally don’t have any body odour (just intent on smelling nice because I hate BO on others).","Don’t think of it too much . If u only have 5 rides and 1 driver gives you 1 Star , your rating will be 4.0 so even only one driver gives you 1 Star it will make your rating bad , just keep doing what u do .. most of the time driver donot have time to check on rating Maybe odor problem?  Smelly cat? What you didn't mention is the pickup, dropoff locations and the distance and traffic conditions. Some drivers take it upon themselves to discourage you to make those unprofitable trips by Uber and warn other drivers via ratings. Also, drivers have to rate you right after the trip before they can see if you tip in the app. Maybe racism . Uber drivers are as racist as taxi drivers. I lived in NYC, and my rating was much lower than when I moved to the Bay Area. Depends on the location and angry drivers I suppose.

I wonder if you can just erase your account and start over?"

Scheduling a long Uber ride,5,28.272120902140937,uber,"So I’m planning to schedule an Uber ride a few days ahead of time. The ride should take an hour and 45 min. Will the Uber driver know where I’m heading before they pick me up? I don’t want to schedule the Uber ride and have the Uber driver arrive to pick me up, then refuse to drive that far away.","Scheduling your Uber ride is not going to change this possibility. Just order it when you're ready. As soon as the ride is accepted send a message through the app to the driver on how long the ride is and ask if they okay with that. Most are. Nope.  Scheduling a ride on Uber is no different on the driver side than just getting the next ping.  What I would do is give yourself more time if you're going to schedule a ride in case something happens.  Once a driver picks up your ping, text them and let them know it's a long ride and where you're going, so they can cancel immediately and not waste everyone's time if they don't want to go there.

If you schedule a ride on Lyft, the driver can see when and where you're going, so that's a safer bet to ease the anxiety. Yup scheduling a ride just mean you notify uber about ur ride , but not the drivers ... if it’s longer than 45 mins and about 2 hours trip , best is to text ur driver than you will be giving them tips cash advance ..

For a driver to go out 2 hours away they prob only be making $100 and no return fee , and have to wait til the get rematch for their return destination 

I drove someone from Austin to Houston and only received $150 for 3 hour rides , and 3 hours ride back without rematch ... thank god the rider tip $100 in cash since he was grateful I’m willing to take him , he choose lyft and driver cancelled on him 3 times , ube canceled on him two times For peanuts he has every right to refuse that ride. This is what happens when a behemoth wants to treat its customers right but not the people working for them . id recommend texting the driver and letting them know up front as well as offering enough of a cash tip to pay for gas on the way back."

My doubt is this: if I buy a Gift Card here in Mexico, it'll be in Mexican pesos, so then, will they be automatically conversed to US Dollar? Or do I have to buy my Gift Card over in the States for it to be on US Dollars? 

Also, do gas stations in the States sell Uber Gift Cards? Or do I have to buy it on Walmart or somewhere else?","No idea on spot conversion. I have a feeling the MXD will stay in value in MXD and just do a conversion as you use it.

I'd get a credit card. They're better in Mexico too when you can use them. Most gas stations I see in my area sell Uber Gift Cards. Uber also accepts PayPal if you have it. Use PayPal with Lyft .

Driver picks up my trip again after I cancelled the first time.,26,28.457155624410067,uber,"I had a driver sit in an apartment complex for five minutes while I watched them. They finally move and sit by the gate for a few more minutes. I cancel the ride. I don't have time to wait like that.


Of course, when I try to get another Uber, the same driver accepts it and then sits there for a few more minutes. Now I'm angry. I cancel this ride and the third time I try, my card is declined. My bank thought it was fraud. I have to wait 20 minutes to use my card.


Why does uber let the person I cancelled on pick up my next request? This lets drivers screw over customers if they feel inclined. A driver can just not select a customer they want. The customer can't refuse a driver.

Edit for clarity: I live in a house. Driver was in an apartment complex a few streets away the entire time. They sat in one spot for five minutes, then drove towards the gate on the map and sat there even longer. They never left their starting area.","1. Drivers have an acceptance rate and some actually care about it. 
2. No, the customer cannot ""driver shop"". This is usually because someone confuses Uber with tinder.
3. Where exactly did you expect the driver to wait? I'll bet you dollars to donuts that he was on the pin and you are an asshole. If you cancel within the first two minutes you won't get charged a cancellation fee. However, that driver seems to have been the closest to you, so Uber's algorithm kept matching you. Uhh...why didn't you go out to the gate and meet him cause the gate probably has a code?  You can't expect the driver to magically show up at your front door with no gate code.  Also, if you could see him waiting at the gate, why didn't you do something about it?  He obviously can't get in cause he doesn't have the code.  And it's not on the driver who picks up your ride.  On Uber, we can't see who's requesting the ride ahead of time, it just tells us the type of ride, pax rating and ETA. You could have called or texted the driver the correct location. Always double check your pickup location, GPS could misplace your location. The driver is only going to sit there if his pickup timer started, so he was close enough to get that started.

We as drivers have no idea if your pickup location is correct, and if was accidentally at the apartment's, that seems like a logical pickup location. Go learn how to order uber ...  do you live in apartment with gate code ? 

Do you stand at the pick up spot ready to be picked up ? 

Most drivers donot want to call and will use text instead , to do this he/she have to park at the safe spot and text you 

How long before you cancel the Uber ? Do you expect uber to be infront of your house in 1 min ? Or 10? Did you give the driver the gate code to get in? If not, your mistake. He went to the address, couldn't get in, waited out the timer and got his cancel fee Driver here, go watch a YouTube video on how this all works. The only way the timer could have started was if he was at the pin. Either you used the wrong address or the app somehow glitched, either way it wasn't his fault, it sounds like he was at the pin. Let me get this straight. You hating on a driver that’s accepting your requests? I love these people coming up with fake excuses for the driver when it is an obvious scam. Driver excepts ride and doesn’t move, you cancel out of aggravation, driver collects more money from the cancellation fee then they would for a typical 3.76 minimum fare ride. Wait what...."

Premium trip likely etc: when it’s only 5 mins ride and $3 rides

Hey go here , it’s busy , and u wait there for 45 mins for $3 rides

If uber and lyft stop slashing the rate per mile and per min, no one will complain ... so far none of the riders complaining about the price ... it’s cheaper than taxi , it’s faster, it’s more options than taxi , and in some market the driver are fun as hell , some even have a party car That's what people said about New York... yet I don't see any New Yorkers in here complaining... my reply to a similar thread in a different sub. Looking for lots of responses on this since I’m genuinely curious as to what the consensus on it is. 

I posed this as more of a question in another thread, but I’m gonna put here as more of a statement. Open to learning things that prove me wrong. 

Another glaring flaw with anti-AB5 assumptions, one that seems to be conspicuously ignored by the companies and people who are against the bill, is that there is nothing in the bill that requires Uber/Lyft/DoorDash/etc to permanently convert all workers to employees. All the bill does is confirm that workers were never employees under the current model. But that doesn’t mean that the only options for the company are treating drivers like shit, and firing a lot of drivers while also treating them like shit. There’s no legal reason they can’t pivot and alter their standard operating platform in a way that legally treats drivers as private contractors. 

This is why AB5 is ultimately good by my estimation. Everyone knows that currently, those companies don’t have a sustainable business model, and the added costs of turning drivers to employees would only make it less sustainable. So their best bet is to figure out a way to abide by the law. The reason they are fighting it so hard is because this may ultimately mean smaller margins, and less money they can hemorrhage into fantastical future flying taxis. But I definitely think they will find it preferable to going out of business. 

And the fact is, if they do insist on fighting this all the way to the grave, public perception as well as driver satisfaction will plummet, leaving them extremely vulnerable to third party startups. At that point it just takes one new player, operating on a humble business model, paying drivers fairly and providing convenient, competitively priced transportation to riders to rip the market right out from under them. 

They know all this. But their insistence that there’s simply nothing they can do and that this law necessarily means that things will have to get worse for drivers only goes further to show how their company culture is one based on nothing more than exploitation. They are both toast - Uber and Lyft Uber cannot have the cake and the icing .. it’s one way or the other .. that’s what the bill is for ...

This thing doesn’t happens overnight .. it still a grayspot category and Uber is pushing it ... lyft knows , lyft play with it too , but since lyft slashing the rates recently a lot of drivers opt for doordash /uber more than lyfts

Competition is coming and I’m sure by 2021 all regulation will be in place .. uber play for the long game since they autonomous fleet should be able to enter the market as soon as the regulation for AI and autonomous car in place Drivers union sounds  good.. what the fuck is wrong with people... unionize  is the only way If driver sign up at the rate they sign up , then Uber shouldn’t slash the rates , also they need to stop hiding the route , the distance of the trip , and stop the “premium trip likely “ when they know first hand where the rider goes , how much they gonna get charge with surge or without ..

Truck driver are fully independent contractor , they know the route , how much they haul , how many hours to take , if they want to take it or not without repercussions ..

By making driver to maintain acceptance rate higher , cancelation below 3% for diamond category , Uber it self playing with the contractor privilege hence they should category it as employees .."

I like to hang at McDonalds late at night. Don’t accept 20 min away requests because you aren’t paid to drive there. Customer will blame you for whatever goes wrong and you have to account for that.

What is considered a low score for a rider on Uber?,42,29.070662568901426,uber,"I had an uber driver tell me that my rating was really low and that he a lot of drivers don’t accept ride requests in that range. 
My score is a 4.69... I think that is pretty good but the few times I have used uber the last few weeks I’ve asked and they all say “yeah, that’s a pretty low score compared to what I usually see”
Is 4.69 really that low?","Put it this way, if a driver is rated at 4.6x, the driver becomes deactivated from driving. It really depends on which city you’re in. I was in Cape Town South Africa and I didn’t have a international drivers license so I had to rely on other people to take me. When my friends or roommates couldn’t drive me I had to use Uber. My rating ended up being a 4.45 while there. I talked about the rating because I was afraid it was low and everyone else I talked to who used it said their ratings were around the same or 4.6 at the highest. Some of them were also from the US, UK, or Australia but others were locals in Cape Town. Tbh some of the drivers (in just about any city) will rate you down if you don’t tip in cash. My rating stopped dropping once I started tipping at least R10 (ZAR currency) because it made the driver more sure I was going to rate them 5 stars and that I thought they did a good job driving me I'm a waitress and I honestly sometimes wish there was a rating system for guests and servers the way uber has it. Yesterday I served some guests that made me so angry in the first 10 minutes I was actually shaking. Our restaurant is fairly expensive, and we'd worked out a special deal with the organizers of this event to charge them basically half our normal price.

&#x200B;

They were so needy and demanding when they walked in the room. They kept saying our restaurant is the only one that has these types of problems. The room was too cold, they wanted the table moved about 6 inches which would have meant taking apart the entire setup to move it, we only set the table for 30 (they reserved for 25) but now they have 40 guests coming, it was never-ending.

&#x200B;

Those guests will never be allowed back in our restaurant, but it would have been so satisfying to rate them one star. In the end, I was stuck there for 4 hours while they pitched their snake oil to the poor people stuck in that room, and walked out with $29. You're basically borderline on who I would accept a ride. Yes, 4.6x is considered a pretty bad rating.  

Personally, I don't take anything below 4.7 - most drivers on here will tell you the same thing. I see below a 4.8 and go, nope! I would take you because who knows like what if someone downrated you because of prejudice. Just don’t be a dick let’s ride

Edit: and if yr a dick I will end the ride and escalate accordingly but you’d rather have ME protect YOU. Trust me ;) Think of the number to the right of the decimal as a grade 90-A, 80-B, 70-C, 60-D. You're a high D. You or people that ride with you are doing something wrong and I can't believe you have no idea what it is. Wouldn’t you at least think about canceling on a driver with a 4.69? Works both ways. 

The rating system has always been f*ed up. 

5 stars = good
4.7 stars = risk for deactivation (for drivers)
4 stars = I should be fired 

Most passengers are 4.8-4.9. I’d pick up a 4.69 if it was a short ride and keep my fingers crossed that you aren’t TOO much of an asshole. I feel like fellow drivers are too nitpicky about the ratings. Day in and day out I see them come in here and complain about ""fairness"" and ratings being arbitrary if rated less than a five for driving. And I agree with them, usually. So I like to give passengers the benefit of the doubt when it comes to ratings, because yeah, people are fucking dumb. If I receive a ride request from you, that means I've never rated you 3 stars or below and you've never done anything to me. So I'm going to accept your ride, doesn't matter if you're a five star rider or a 3.5. Thats pretty bad, bottom 10% or so for my market (Dallas). You should start tipping in cash. In my town I don’t think I’ve seen that low in my month and a half of driving. I have a 4.91 and I barely tip.  I try to be easy though.  I’m always waiting at the pick up, don’t talk unless talked to, then I guide them at the end and wish them a good day.  If they do me a favor I’ll tip in cash. Like I had a guy drive me through an atm, this was between trips and had him wait a minute for the next.  If you were to have him/her do that while on one trip I’m sure they’d be pissed. Mine is 4.87 and I am almost always drunk when I call an Uber. 4.69 is pretty bad, especially if you have a lot of trips. If you don't have a lot of trips it could just be one bad rating screwing you over. One time my daughter was 900 miles away, she missed the last hotel shuttle from Disney and her and her cousin had no ride so she called dad.

She had my old phone with my account and credit card and I told her to just order an Uber.

Well apparently you can’t give someone your account, you can’t put a minor in a car, you can’t let someone use your account, and a couple other rules I broke.

Well frankly the driver was an ass because if he didn’t want the ride he should have denied it, not taken it an given me a one star.

So my point is my rating is not reflective of how I will act in your car, it’s more about drivers punishing people for problems with the rules  in there area the rider may be unaware of. Overall it hurt Uber that he did that, I’m taking twenty lifts a month Really shitty at this, I have a 4.84 rating that keeps dropping and would have close to or more than 1000 rides, and I tip in the app constantly. [deleted] Would NEVER pick up with that rating. 

See, it's easier to wait for the 4.9 ride 2 min later. Less of a chance there will be a problem"

The best thing is for Uber to block him but I doubt support will be competent enough to do that. What do you mean “ split fares with you”? Technological company with aspirations of flying a car , can’t fix trivial  little safety things . 
That’s Uber in a nutshell. Honestly, it sounds to me like you have a case for a restraining order. IANAL, but I recently had to get one on an ex who would constantly sent emails from new email addresses (so I couldn't block him, bc he'd just make a new one). 
Keep documentation of every time he contacts you or sends a request. Collect all documentation of him previously contacting you in other ways, and if you have proof of you actually telling him to leave you alone or that you don't wish to be contacted, and then him still contacting you afterwards, that helps tremendously. Print emails, phone records, social media messages, etc. and keep them together. You will add these to court documents you will fill out.

Not sure where you are, but here in NC, you get the documents to fill out a request for a restraining order at your county courthouse (you might be able to get them online). You should look up the specific laws for what qualifies for a RO in your state, but this is harassment and possibly cyberstalking. You should put an end to this now. So he just randomly sends requests to split fares?  That's kind of brilliant and douchey at the same time.  If he does it to random people on every ride,  I'm sure many accept without thinking."

Re: Uber Hell,5,30.418162569003528,uber,"I now know why people believe rideshare operations are a bad idea.  

In my previous post the worst l said about the driver was that she seemed ""evasive"" because even her contract employer stated they didn't understand why they couldn't reach her.  I did mention that Uber themselves seemed confused as to their policy.

Yes I left my property, yes I was panicked, so I'm guilty of being human, but I was left in a infinite loop of Uber saying ""it is better to contact the driver we are only a facilitator"" and the driver being unreachable. The only option I could see was to contact the police with the only information I had, a plate number which, the officer kindly accommodated.  All I wanted was to reach the lady, as she was otherwise unreachable, to arrange to collect my property.

At least cab companies have dispatch offices that may or may not help, but they definitely CAN reach their drivers.

I have many times personally traveled and taken time out of my day to return wallets, personal effects, pets, even a couple of children to their homes. And yes, occasionally people were ungrateful- that's on them.  Why do you find it easier to demonize people for their loss rather than enjoying a moment of personal decency on your part?

Sure there are people who choose to be righteous assholes, but you're letting their nastiness stain your existence.  

Have your experiences driving rideshare been so consistently bad that it has driven you to this depth of darkness?

I can imagine at least some of you have been known to bemoan ""corporate greed"", what about your personal greed?  I don't return things for compensation, just kindness.

In the end many (not all) of you  seem to be in a seething state of anger and vengeance that is toxic. None of your behavior inspires me to ever get in a rideshare car again.

I check the backseat so nothing is left behind. Because I don’t want other people’s stuff. I’ll try not to be snarky here. 

Rideshare rides are generally much cheaper than taxi rides for a reason. There’s less regulation on rideshare, and normally that makes no difference.  Sometimes that does make a difference. Sadly, you’re experiencing one of those times. 

It also does seem like you are saying “I know I made a mistake but..” and not actually acknowledging that you abandoned your own property.  Unintentionally, yes, but that is what happened.  A reasonable person would try to give you back your property.  Most rideshare drivers are reasonable people.  

I saw many drivers respond to you indicating how little Uber incentivizes property return, and how that time can be be really valuable for them to spend on other activities.  Whose fault is that?   I don’t know that there’s a clear answer there, but I do think that simply calling the drivers bitter for acknowledging reality is simply not helpful for your own health and happiness. 

I wish you the best of luck in future rides.  If you prefer the more regulated taxi industry, have at it. It still exists in my town for exactly that reason. [deleted] I try to make it fun.

The driver's name is Asaithambi and the vehicle number is TN 48 AS 7290 (Toyota Etios). I have 3 videos of the incident and a photo of his car. Please let this be shared as much as possible. 

This happened on 03-Sept-2019 Tuesday 8PM @ Elcot-SEZ, Chennai, in front of the TechMahindra office. I had picked up my 2-year old daughter from the daycare and was carrying her, my laptop backpack and the baby bag. On top if it, I was feeling a bit unwell as well, making this experience a horrible nightmare in total!

It was raining and no cabs were accepting rides or were asking me to be cancel if assigned. I had been trying from 7PM and around 7:30PM, one uber cab was assigned. I called the driver and he said he in on the way, there is heavy traffic and so will take some time to reach. I said okay and waited.

By the time he reached, it was 8PM. I got in, kept the bags and settled with the child. He then asked me where the drop location is. When I told him the place, he said he can not go. He said he can't get out of the IT park itself coz there is heavy traffic inside itself. 

I told him wherever he wants to go from here, he has to cross this traffic anyways and asked him why he did not say this when I called him 20-25minutes ago when his cab was assigned. I said it is not fair that he made us wait for so long and then refuses the ride; he could tell me earlier and I would have booked another cab.

Then, the driver's behaviour changed and he started shouting and name calling. He said it is his car and he decides where he goes; he is not driving us and asked us to get out. He even reached out to the back and tried to force us out. I have taken a video of this part. 

I analysed the situation and figured it is more dangerous to try and exit the car when he is still in the driving seat. I have a child and two bags with me and if he drives off in a hurry before I get down with all that, we could get hurt. So I refused to get down. 

Then he came out of the driver seat, came to our side, opened the backdoor and started shouting at me to get out of the car. My daughter got frightened and clinged onto me. But even that did not stop this monstrous individual. He kept on shouting and tried to force us out of the car. 

I analysed the situation again quickly and realised if I get out in front of him, he could hurt us because my hands are busy holding the baby and 2 bags and he is standing too close to us. I won't be able to capture a video or use my pepper spray. The safest now was inside the car. I took my pepper spray out as a precaution, just in case and told him that I am not coming out. I have two videos of him doing this performance. 

Then he walked away, leaving us on the side of the road. I tried the uber safety line option in their app and it kept on going to automated messages. Uber's safety line is a sham and it does not work, I suppose. 

The driver had cancelled the ride by then and I was charged Rs.45 for it. Asking a refund of this, was the only thing I was able to do with the uber app. I left a feedback about the incident in the app, but no one has reached out to me yet. The driver was in a safe distance by now, so I booked an uber auto and got out of the car finally. 

Normal people will be more friendly when they see a mom with a small child, but not this guy. If this person can do this to a mom and child travelling alone at night, he could do anything and he could even hurt anyone without any empathy or moral conscience.

Video in comments (unable to add video)","Driver sounds like a dick. Sorry this happened to you. Most drivers don’t do this crap. Go with this on social media, and #Uber - "" I tried the uber safety line option in their app and it kept on going to automated messages. "" While this sucks and he was rude, you should have gotten out when he asked. It's not our fault we don't know where you're going, we aren't allowed to ask before we pick you up, it's our car and our decision, and once he asked and you refused, you were in the wrong.

As with all stories like this, I have a healthy skepticism it actually happened the way you said.

Also, no child seat means no ride for smart drivers. It’s the Upper Management Ethos,  it flows down the chain of command to the drivers ."
"Bot help = no help ...I'm sick of trying. If I just close my account and start over, can I open a new one using the same name, phone, email and payment method?",4,31.052444976446804,uber,,"What are you trying to do? I mean you can start up with a new email and phone number, are you worried about your customer rating? Using multiple accounts on Uber is the fastest way to get banned from the platform. > can I open a new one using the same name, phone, email and payment method?       

Why would they ever allow this?       
At minimum you should use a different credit card, different email, get a new phone number and for your name use first and middle initials. Only keep the same phone. The app can, of course, see your phones serial number but people do resell phones or give them to family. Let us know how it goes. Nope."
"As a Lyft driver, I've maintained a consistent 5* rating my entire driving career. As an Uber driver, I'm 4.78*. Here's what I've learned about pax from both services.",20,31.171843124608753,uber,"Obviously this is all anecdotal evidence but I just wanted to share some similarities and differences I've experienced now that I've been driving for both services for a few months. These stories are all while providing the exact same service (Giving full AC and music control to pax, multiple phone chargers, mints, gum, and water provided, and helping to load luggage/groceries)


I get more compliments with Lyft passengers. Whether that's about my car, the amenities provided, or the simple fact that I let them put on their own music, they are almost always impressed. Very rarely will I get compliments from Uber passengers.


Lyft passengers tip more often, but Uber passengers tip higher amounts. Anywhere between 50%-70% of my Lyft passengers on any given day will tip $1-$2, while ~25% of my Uber passengers will tip $3-$5. Obviously there are those that tip more or less but these are the ranges where they average out.


Lyft passengers are more likely to acknowledge user error, but only because the app is less prone to it. Don't get me wrong, both apps have their fair share of pax who will blame you if they're not where the pin is, will get upset if you're stuck in traffic while picking them up, etc, but a majority of Lyft customers will have GPS tracking on their phone where you can see where they actually are vs where the pin is, while Uber pax will rarely have it enabled on their app. I think one is enabled by default while the other isn't.


Lyft support is generally better about hearing you out on paxilla complaints while Uber will generally tell you to stick a thumb up your a** and go drive more to ""average it out"". For context, I recently had a previous pax make a report incident for every issue on the complaint screen at the same time and rate me 1 star because I wouldn't deliver their lost phone without being compensated for the 40+ miles it took to deliver it to them. Furthermore, the fact that passengers can rate you lower if you don't have an interesting conversation or don't want to tell the same 4 interesting stories multiple times a day is dehumanizing and sick. Some of us want to talk, some of us just want to do our job.


Uber is SO MUCH better about helping you prioritize good trips vs bad ones. Today, like an idiot I decided to accept a passenger 15 miles away thinking it was an airport trip, but they just wanted to go to the store. I was paid $5 for that ride. This would have never happened with Uber because they allow you to see the trip details beforehand. Even then, Uber offers Quick Passes now and Pickup Premiums, both of which Lyft do not. Their quick pass equivalent is very hit or miss and more often than not you end up wasting your time.


Overall, Lyft could do a better job of improving the features on their app to make the driver experience more pleasant and Uber could do a MUCH better job not catering to the whims of paxillas (but some would argue that both apps have an issue with that) at the cost of a driver's livelihood. What do you guys think?","I think you're just experiencing a form of the rideshare distortion field. Basically an example of confirmation bias. You think certain things about lyft or uber and then when they come true you remember it and use it to reinforce the ideas you already have about them. Most driver I know including me quit lyft and fulltime uber now since the rate on lyft is drastically low.... I’ll go doordash and Uber from now on > This would have never happened with Uber because they allow you to see the trip details beforehand.

They only allow you to see the trip details if you accept the rides. The moment you actually USE this feature to decline them you lose the ability to see details, which brings you back full circle not knowing whether to accept a long pickup like this or not. (if you're determined call ahead and ask them destination. No way am I driving 15 miles without knowing where they are going) Uber looks like they are trying to build a slave labor network at any and all costs. They will probably cut rates down to 10 cents a mile and chumps will still be driving. Lyft is pretty much in bed of uber and is the female-friendly pink version, so basically holding you down with fuzzy cuffs instead of raw steel like Uber. These companies need an education of basic labor laws, workers rights, and a fair pay. Last time I checked these companies have HORRIBLE online reviews and yet they expect their employees to perform at 5 star service, so basically a Ritz-Carlton hotel at McDonald's prices (sub McD's pay) and horrible abuse and trash treatment from pax. They all need to burn to the fucking ground. I can't wait for ethical companies to start taking over this whole greedy ridescam silicone valley fuck job. With all due respect. 

There are NO difference in the Lyft or Uber passenger.

Kind people are kind people and both use Uber & Lyft. 

3 years. 6300 rides...4.95 on Uber 4.99 on Uber. Tipped on both everyday as well as not tipped. Here's what I've learned: there's no difference between Uber and Lyft passengers. Uber doesn't even have that feature anymore for GPS.  I remember enabling it.  Then one day it vanished.  When I watch my drivers I see just the standard pin for me and everyone else. Okay so my experience may be different but like since I worked as a bartender, adult video store clerk, and grew up ghetto as fuck, I am pretty good at keeping pax entertained and can get a car of drunk pax playing cash cab with me or something. I never give them the aux cord. I mostly play rap and r&b. I have a 5.0 on Lyft and a 4.89 on Uber. People say I’m entertaining & I have regulated some nasty ass pax! I average $20-25 an hour including cash tips and more if they want to end the ride and pay with cash or Square reader. Lol. I keep both apps on and do not do food delivery. Lyft pax are more likely to be more educated & LGBTQ. 

About 70% of my Lyft pax tip. My Uber pax don’t tip as often but when they do, they tip like $1. Uber has more obnoxious pax and I’d rather shoot myself in the face than do food delivery because i am not getting in trouble for what the restaurant didn’t do. If they did it wrong and I find out, then they remake it and I call to notify the customer that it needs to be remade, it then becomes my fault & they think I just tampered with it or ate it and asked the restaurant to make another one. Ugh lol I think you shouldn’t be offering freebies. Nor should you let passenger pick the music and don’t help them with anything. Dammit its drivers like you that make us other lazy, inconsiderate drivers that want to listen to our music, look bad."
"Won't let me update my payment method; just shows white screen. Why is this service so buggy even after years, and how is it still popular with people despite this?",7,31.239389420916087,uber,Image,"Minor inconveniences < accessibility.. I guess? Try the website. I've heard this from multiple people, they use Lyft instead of Uber now because they can't even add their payment info lol Sometimes the app bugs. It should be fixed in about a month I've used VISA as my payment method ever since I opened my account a few years ago. No problems, even when I had to update the account number. Had to do that again this past week, just get blank screen. The twitter and uber message bots have repeated to me 15 times, ""Uber does not accept that payment method. You can, however, use another method, Paypal, google wallet, etc.  We also take credit cards"".   It's so screwed up that I may just try closing this account and opening a new one. Sorry if obvious but did you reinstall the app? Theses suckers want you to chauffeur in a self driving car and flying taxis .can you believe this ?

Weird charges from California on bank statement. I’m in Dallas,1,31.32765330981325,uber,Looked at my bank statement. Used Uber the other night and I’m in Dallas. I have no charges saying anything about Dallas but I have some that say California. What’s up,"Ubers headquarters are in California. If you use Lyft it will also say San Francisco, California."
Gotta love the gross PAX!,2,31.381530624628066,uber,"You know? The ones who stink, or take their shoes off in your car, or the ones who just HAVE to have that last puff off their smoke, then climb in reeking of cigarettes,  or the ones who have dogs and either drag in a TON of dog hair into your car/floormats, or worse yet POO that smears on your mat....

THANK YOU !!!","If I pull up and my passenger is smoking, I just cancel and keep driving. 

I picked up a passenger the other day who was NOT smoking but reeked of nicotine. It was oozing out of their pores so bad that I could actually taste it on my tongue. When they got it out I had to Ozium the whole car and drive with the windows down just to air out the smell and I didn't even get it 100% gone before my next pax. I hate that too... Even worse? You complain to Uber and they do fuck-all to compensate you, even if the cleaning means you'll have to be out of commission for 3 days.

[At least Lyft gave me $25](https://redd.it/80t3xh) (but driving for them is hell and I stopped driving with them), but I had another one that had a strong smell that triggered allergy-related headaches, and all that happened was a go-nowhere argument and all the trolls provoking me here on /r/uber when I posted about it."
UBER HELL,93,31.477664883898363,uber,"I left a bag in the trunk of an Uber last night, driver will only respond to messages sent from Uber - not me.  Uber told me this morning after 9 am that driver had offered to meet me between 7-9 am to return my bag.  I have to proactively contact Uber because, though they promise to call me with messages from their driver, they don’t.  

The people that take the calls are the most dispassionate people I’be ever heard on a help line.  I’m to the point of calling the police because the driver is so evasive and Uber appears to care not about their customers.","Sorry about this but it is 100% on you as a passenger to track you belongings.  

The driver may have never seen the bag. For all you know, you were dropped off, the driver picked up the next customer, and that customer took it.  Driver are go-go-go. Several times I already have a new customer waiting for me before I drop my current passenger off. 

When you use a public service, very important to track your stuff. 

I’ve returned items before... 15 bucks isn’t worth it. Takes me from driving which is a lost profit. I’m up around the 30-45 buck a hour range, I’m not stopping.   I’ll offer to drop it off at a local business nearby me and the passenger can find a way to get to that business. In case you haven't figured it out Uber doesn't give two shits about their customers or drivers.

You are entirely stuck with the hope that you have a nice driver who is willing to go out of their way to help you get your stuff back.

Honestly, if I found out you were filing police reports and such I would just dump your stuff in a trash can and say I was mistaken and it was someone else's bag and let you deal with Uber (ha! good luck) or the police (won't do a thing). Police won’t do anything, you left it in the car, he didn’t steal it . It may just be gone unfortunately, it’s the same as if you left your bag on the bus or any public space . Uber and its drivers has a lot of problems, but this isnt on them. This is completely your fault for being irresponsible and leaving your stuff in someones car, the only hell you are experiencing is due to your lack of paying attention. Learn to be a grown up and keep track of your stuff, it's not up to the driver to lose tons of money because of your mistake. Always funny when a pax forgets something and blames the driver. Perhaps you should offer 50 bucks or something to the driver for stopping work, driving to you to return items YOU left, and then drive back to where he is from. Stop being an ass. Driver won't give you their contact info because you're totally giving off a vibe that says I'll screw you over - your bag just isn't worth the trouble.

You have no compassion for your driver as a person, so why should they do anything other then bring your item to the local PD and turn it in for a property receipt?

By screwing up and leaving your bag you already became more of a burden then a benefit. When you start throwing accusations around you're every driver's second worst nightmare. At a point nobody cares about your satisfaction anymore. That's what you get with discount services. Could you entertain the possibility that the driver isn't working Uber every second of the day?  You forgot your bag last night.  Your urgency is not his.  It could take a couple of days to get your bag back.  He's going through Uber so you can't claim he didn't return it rather than making a side deal.

Text the driver and say that Uber only told you about the offer to meet between 7 am and 9 am AFTER 9 am and that you would prefer he tell you directly when he is available, as well as Uber if he wants, but if he contacts Uber alone it will drag this whole thing out.

The police will take a report about anything.  That means nothing. He got you from Point A to Point B safely. He did his job.

Sounds like you didn’t do your job and are now expecting him to work for free and do your job too (keeping track of your possessions).

How much have you offered him $$ to perform this extra job that wasn’t part of the agreed upon service that you did receive? Oh God...  Not another lost item in a ride share.  You know those guys make next to no money in that business and are not employees.  They need a drop off place for lost and found.  Coordinating with the pax is a bitch.  Just drop off at the local police station? What would you report to the police? Felony Dumbass can’t keep track of their shit?

The driver doesn’t want to have to put up with passengers who call non stop about getting their stuff back. 

Usually the process of returning stuff takes half a day. Most pax think we live where we picked you up or dropped them off. Most don’t. They may live an hour or two away, and they tend to be doing one of two things; driving, in that case trucking your shit around is really annoying, and probably results in them deadheading shit you didn’t care enough about to check that you had when you got dropped off, and maybe screwing up a back to back to back to back mode Uber gets into, or they are not driving, and they really don’t want pax shit disturbing their free time. 

If you say “but I’ll come pick it up wherever...” understand that statement comes with the entitlement that there is nothing involved for the driver to do. It isn’t that way. Usually it’s at least 3-4 phone calls. 

At worst it’s a whole day of “I’ll be there at 11am” 

Then another call “can we make it 9am?” -no -11 we said 11, I set up my day for 11- 

Another call, “it would be better for me if it was 9, how about 10?” Argh, 

Then another call, “where are you again?” -Starbucks at XYZ mall. “Ok”

Another call, “wow, I didn’t realize xyz is so far away, that’s like an hour away, could we meet half way in between?” -at this point I want to say, why don’t I just drop it off with you, I only charge $100 for that, and you can stop calling me fucking up my morning?, nope, they sound like cheapasses. Let’s check the app to see if they tipped... nope. They took an 15 min trip around the corner and it paid $2.34 and I get to now fuck up a morning off. 

At 10:45 -I’m getting in the car to drive to drop off, another call, “heeeeyyyy, we hit some traffic, it looks like it’s going to be 11:30 before we get there.” ...ok, I know how this will play out. 

11:15, another call, “heeeeyyyy, my ride hasn’t shown up yet, can we make it 1:00-1:30?”

12:00, another call, “could you just bring it up here? I’ll give you a “BIG TIP”?   Side note “big tips” in pax eyes are in the $5-10 range, they usually come from people who don’t tip the original ride and they expect white glove service, the amount of pain in the ass returning shit should be in the $50-100 range. 

2:30pm pax calls once more, “where are you?”

2:31pm once more “where are you?”

2:32pm pax “where are you?”

2:34pm pax “where are you?”

2:36pm pax “where are you, I’m calling the cops”

2:39pm pax “where are you, my uncles a lawyer, I’m calling the cops”

2:40pm pax “where are you?” -I’m going home - I left your shit in the dumpster between the Indian food restaurant and the day care center on Main st. Have a nice day. Offer to compensate the driver $100. Yes, call the police. And make complaints on all social media. LOL. But I would be very grateful that you heard the word return. Just wait by the phone and don't sleep. How hard is it to keep track of your own shit?

I used to deal with lost and found. It's never worth it. The passengers are ALWAYS rude about it and accuse us drivers of ""stealing"" their shit if we don't drop everything and drive back to them right away.

Now, whenever Uber asks if I found a bag / wallet / phone / whatever in the car, I just say no. Dump it in the closest garbage can and keep on working. What was in the bag? Calling the cops might be your best bet"
Uber will start showing public transit routes to Chicago-area app users Monday,7,31.825118587602066,uber,Image,"Side question, why are they signing huge leases in downtown Chicago? 

If Uber was a person, they would be the guy bitching he can’t make any money while he drinks his 4th Starbucks in his leased BMW waiting in the TNC lot. how did drivers do Thursday during football? hopefully great"
Uber eats question,32,32.05084775428253,uber,"Sometimes when I order Uber eats it will say a driver is picking it up, but the driver is parked and not moving for a pretty long time - tonight it was about 20 minutes. I assume they are waiting to accept another order? It’s a little annoying because the food gets cold.","In all seriousness, the Uber eats platform for drivers is a little frustrating and lacking in good info items that we can send to customers. More often than not, if you are watching the driver not move, it's because the food was not ready when the driver arrived. Restaurants treat Uber eats drivers very badly, in that they treat customers very badly but know that the drivers are the ones they have to deal with. Picking up is a relative term. They may have arrived but waiting to get food from the restaurant. Can’t think of a reason a driver would do that or a way it would benefit them. Time is money, and we don’t get paid for waiting - we are only paid from when we actually pick up the food until we drop it off. We also won’t get another order while one is active unless it is to the exact same restaurant or one right next door to it, so it doesn’t help to put off getting there. 

The only thing I can think of is that if I get an order and I know my way without the gps, I’ll shut of the screen to save power and sometimes the app shuts its self down. It also does this if I have my podcast in the foreground sometimes. 

If this happens and their settings are set to have their location “only when in the app” it can look like they are not moving. I’ve had a couple customers surprised when I knocked because the app had shut down and it looked like I was still 3 miles away 30 seconds before just because I had to restart it when I got close to their house. 

That’s all I can think of 🤷‍♀️ It means the food isn’t ready when the drive gets to the restaurant most likely. Some restaurants don’t prioritize pick ups first when they are really busy. Maybe like the food isn’t ready yet I can only figure out with notorious places with Hooters is stupid and its to call and be “hey my ETA is xyz can you please start making my order it is Amber C1224E” and then when I get the order I check it. But it’s a huge pain in the ass & not worth the pay. Customer will probably still say I tampered with their food and the destination will be 2 min away from the restaurant while I drove 20 min to get to the restaurant. Never again. $3 for what would net me $15/hr at a call center. Fuck that lmao the driver probably needed the 20 minutes to taste the food for your safety.  

many world leaders, such as Vladimir Putin, have their own official food taster to protect them from poisonous or contaminated food

make sure you tip him/her extra for this special service...  the driver must think you're an important politician or royalty? The driver was just not bringing you the food. He went to his house or to a friend's house. Contact Uber"
Uber Platinum,7,32.08996812466394,uber,"Any GOOD benefits for reaching Uber platinum ? 

All I see is price protection and Priority airport pickups... Which tbh aren't that useful to me.

EDIT: I am talking about customers","As a driver, it seems to just be a way to keep drivers driving without actually paying them, I pay zero attention to the point system. 15% off gas is nice. I just got platinum without really trying, it's not worth grinding over but it's easy to get if you do uber full time. $5 for spending $500? You are already paying exorbitant price with Uber over lyft. 
There is no priority pickup ,every underpaid sucker has to wait at the airport parking lot . 
Use Amex platinum or everyday pr Chase preferred or reserve and and get 5% back by using lyft for cheaper .  Use Amex delta with lyft and link your account and earn double.

3 hour uber ride..,30,32.115257476515794,uber,"So I am traveling to Dallas, TX from Connecticut. I have no real options of getting from the airport in Dallas to Nacogdoches, TX because the situation is my friend's mother is in hospice. I really hope I am not stranded in Dallas and I am willing to pay for the Uber. I know it is expensive but you think a driver would accept it?","Honestly man, you're better off taking greyhound. There's a greyhound terminal right in downtown Dallas, and tickets to go to Nacogdoches tomorrow start at about $76 while the Uber from oak cliff to SFAU (only place I knew in Nacogdoches, friend goes there) was ~162. Love Field to Greyhound is ~17 and DFW to Greyhound is ~30. Safe travels! As others have said - a nice tip up front will usually git er dun but I wanted to paint the picture on how to approach this and your mindset so you don't get frustrated.

Airports have waiting lots for lots n lots of drivers. The moment your driver cancels , you get rotated to the next waiting driver. You dont care if the first 9 drivers say no - the more nos you get means you are closer to a yes, etc. SOMEONE will think it's a PERFECT day for a trip to Nago - 

I would create a text (that you can reuse) that says. ""FYI - doing to Nacogdoches  - it's a 3 hour cruise""... ( some will see it's a 180 minute or so trip and approx the number of miles **but not all drivers can and will see this** so you should tell them up front) ""....I know you probably don't get a ride straight back back to Dallas in one shot so I'm throwing an extra $60 CASH ($20/hr) on top as tip. If you don't want it, please cancel and send me back into the que. Much obliged. Thank you"" - Lexiliving.

And they may and will probably cancel on you. This may happen several times before you find the guy  or gal that says Nacogdoches! AWESOME! I can drop by and see Billy Bob and Cleetus and have a real chicken fried steak! - WHATEVER.

Some may pull up and try to up the deal - 'do it for 100-cash' etc. it's up to you since you're paying the freight but I wouldn't agree to that if you are explaining the deal via text - but I would leave the door open. You want a quiet ride, say so and throw another 20 when you get there as an 'actual' tip- etc.

I would tip cash up front once you are in the car and if the guy asks if he can run through a gas station because he's on 1/4 of a tank , HINT: he's secretly hoping you pick that up too. If he didn't try to bump you right off the bat, again you might consider it. Maybe hook a brother up with a burger combo on the way, etc.

It's the little things, after all- and it's a 3 hour ride. If the dude didn't get breakfast and he's running on coffee from 2 hours ago, it's in your best interests to feed him - you get out in those quiet empty country roads and you start to nod. 

Keep an eye on the driver too, if you see them getting too comfy - that's when you strike up the convo - have him run the air as cold as you can - 10 minutes later when he hits the reflectors in the middle or side of the road for the 3rd time, that's when you suggest maybe we should pull over for a snack , take a walk around the building etc. 

Most drivers will not police themselves and try and power through. Just keep your eyes open.

&#x200B;

Thats my 2 cents. With the cash tip and the cost of the Uber, you're much better off getting a rental car assuming you are over 25yo and have a license. In Texas, rental car is the way to go given how far things are apart. 

&#x200B;

If not, then go with the Greyhound option if that fits your schedule. I generally avoid Greyhound whenever possible. I would do it if you offered a cash tip upfront. Not all drivers will agree tho. 

Because the driver will most likely have to dead head back to Dallas I’d honestly say I’d want $60 minimum for the tip. But there may be drivers who would settle for less I have to look more into it. I am tight on time too. If you end up using Uber I would call your driver immediately after they accept the ride and say where you're going. They will probably want to cancel but maybe offer a good cash tip upfront, like $40-60 so they're not losing money on the 3 hour drive back All the don’t take Uber is downvoted. If the said company would use that effort  to screen and vet the drivers properly, they would not need to police social media . yeah, like the other poster said, your best bet is Greyhound.

looked it up for you.. Greyhound has one connecting bus per day. 

Leave Dallas bus station at 8:30AM, arrive Nacogdoches at 2:55PM Okay! This is helpful. I have never done long distance ubers I live in a tiny state so I never really experienced this. Why not rent a car?  

Or just take the bus, way easier and cheaper than dealing with a crazy uber driver. Take the bus, dude  Take Amtrak Acela Express and explore the country. Don’t exploit the driver , he will have to drive back , unpaid ."
WIBTA if I leave a one-star rating for no FastTrak.,28,32.216113958008314,uber,"Driver was pleasant and car was clean, but no Fasttrak on the freeway costs 20+ minutes on the drive.

Fast track in LA should be an Uber requirement.","Uber doesn’t reimburse drivers (or charge passengers) for using Fastrak lanes if the Fastrak is right next to the regular lanes since they can’t determine from the GPS if Fastrak is being used. Only if the route is distinctly different will Uber charge and direct the driver to use Toll lanes.

So even if your driver has Fastrak he couldn’t use it. Considering he was a decent driver otherwise giving him a One star is a really dick move. Hmm, does this FastTrack have a cost? Is it part of the riders fee? Is the Uber driver at fault that such is not included on their fees paid by the rider? THEN why 1-Star the driver... Their account could get deactivated for such. Uncool rider!! You want rock bottom prices, you'll get rock bottom service. That means something like Fastrak is an additional cost to the driver, which Uber does not reimburse. Uber only reimburses tolls where there is no option. Yes It's not required and most uber drivers do it as a side gig, so yes, you would be the a-hole. You're a complete asshole for potentially costing a guy his job for a single thing u weren't Happy for.

What's ur Uber name? So I can make sure I never accept u You should have offered to pay the tolls.  If the driver refused to let you do that then you rate them 1 star. They don’t pay the drivers for fast/express lane .  If you want you should hand him cash . You would still have to pay the toll, and the toll is usually costs 4-7 dollars. Dude what the fuck? We're not required to take toll roads, regardless of whether or not you think it's ""worth it"" You would be the asshole That’s like putting in perspective oh your resume didn’t have certain key words I was looking for, so I am going to trash it."

Using psychology while driving passengers,31,32.50947043951463,uber,"So does anyone else use any psychological tricks, mainly in order to increase tips when driving passengers?

One I use is it tell some passengers that I wish all the other passengers were just like them and give them a specific reason. It works almost every time, everyone likes to have their own tickle pickled!

What do you use?","Nah I just talk to them if they feel like it but if theyre ranting to me about something or telling a story, Im always on their side. No need to be extra. I got a 4.96 rating so Im more focused on getting passenger from point A to point B I told them I wish all the other passengers were just like them, getting from A to B alive. i have this one story for those people who always ask for your wildest story, and it wraps up with the horrible rider saying they were going to tip me after the horrible ride then they didnt. i swear every time i tell that story i get a tip I always give them a sob story about my little adopted orphaned infant Jimmy who had an arm amputated after a horrific Dolphin canning accident in japan.  Luckily we were able to get him back to the states for medical care and are now trying to get him into a trial for a neural implant that would control his Bionic arm that costs $500,000 dollars.  But its worth it because he is so precious.


Edit: just kidding i am just courteous and nice. I use this with servers and cashiers to get free stuff. However I’m quite sincere as I appreciate people who work in service. You're psychoanalyzing the PAX to get a tip??? Interesting I psychoanalyze my passengers in the first minute to decide what kind of ride they are looking for. That = tips...so same thing almost. Try to work into the conversation ""most people only tip a few dollars"" I just open with “I’m only doing this to pay my wife’s medical bills. She has cancer.” I just care about the pax during the duration of the trip... unless I get their number lol If we talk, and they tell me where they are from, ex : This area of town, or this part of the country, I right away say that I love people from that place , they are so nice etc etc. Say they have great food and just say nice things about their town city or country. I’m not being paid enough to care I sure the fuck do.. stroking  someone's  ego is the best way to get tips.. *cringe* don’t do that"

Religious discrimination by driver,10,32.87693571730344,uber,"I generally have a really good experience with Uber and had a 5 star rating before this ride. I get along with drivers and have interesting conversations with them. Granted I have a total of 26 rides (it’s only been a year since I’ve started using the service) but I was still happy about my 5.0. 

But I was going home late with my roommate and got in an Uber. The driver asked my name (it’s the most common female Muslim name btw). I told him and he said his mother and daughter have the same name as me. Then proceeded to ask if I’m Muslim. I told him no, but my family is (I don’t believe in anything).

He got really offended at this and told me that I shouldn’t leave the religion my parents taught me. I was being really understanding, telling him I know where he’s coming from, but for me religion is more complex than that and beyond what my parents know. But dude acted like I’m personally insulting him by not believing what he believes. The ride home was quite uncomfortable. At one point he said that my parents are disappointed in me for my actions and that my future children are going to be deprived of the truth. My rating dropped to 4.92 after this ride and I’m not happy about that.

Am I crazy for reporting him for being rude and unprofessional and also for asking Uber to redact my low rating? I’m just trying to get home safe after a night out clubbing. I didn’t walk into a Friday sermon at my local mosque, jeez. Is there any way to get my perfect rating back?","You’re absolutely valid for reporting him, that was incredibly unprofessional of him to do. 

It is however unlikely Uber will do anything about your rating. They don’t reverse them for drivers either. welcome to uber. I know drivers who listen to Quran verses all day long on their bluetooth headphones, but they don't push it on other people. I'd complain I know losing 5 stars sucks but remember pax ratings mean nothing at all. My pax rating is 4.3 and no one cares.

But anyone making u uncomfortable with religious/politics talk absolutely report Nope Drivers have to sit there and receive the same exact shit from pax EVERY RIDE. Enjoy it. Captive and slave to the rating.

Uber's rating system encourages dogmatic submission to the other. Consider that uber hides the impact of particular driver ratings by staggering how many rides later you see the impact of the rating.  So a change in rating should not be possible from your most recent driver. 

That said,  if you do the math,  you got a 3 star rating somewhere,  most likely from a few drivers back.  It’s the company culture . Flows from top down to the bottom."
"Uber driver took me to the wrong location, Uber says that they don't give refunds?",11,32.95015330990707,uber,"I've used Uber many times over the past few years, but this is my first negative experience. The first odd thing I noticed was that after scheduling the ride and confirming it, it charged me a few dollars more than what it originally said. Whatever, I just went along with it. So I got in the car and tried to chat with the driver a little, but it was clear he spoke little English. We drove for about 10 minutes before he pulled over and said we were here. I could tell it wasn't right, so I checked the map and checked the Uber app to make sure I picked the right location. The location showed where I wanted to go on the app, but we were nowhere near it. I tried explaining to the driver that this wasn't right and where we were supposed to be going, but he wasn't understanding me and just kept pointing to his phone showing that we've arrived and I needed to get out, so I did. Now I had to get a second Uber to take me to the correct location which cost me just as much.

When I got there I contacted Uber to explain the issue. They apologized and said that they would credit my account $3. I told them that wasn't good enough because I had to get a second Uber which cost me just much and I asked for a refund for the first one, to which they told me that it's not in their policy to give refunds. Excuse me, what?? I'd think that if a company took someone to some random location, kicked them out, and stranded them there that they'd be bending over backwards to make it right, but they won't even do the bare minimum of giving me back my money? 

I know there are a lot of drivers here on this sub and I've seen stories of people saying that passengers would complain about something that didn't happen, and then the driver didn't get paid for that trip. But then where is the money going if Uber isn't refunding the passenger? Just seems really strange to me. Is this normal for Uber? I think I will probably just issue a charge back on my credit card for the first trip and forget about using Uber ever again.","If you do a chargeback you'll get your account banned for life. Uber *does* offer refunds, especially for passengers that dont have a history of requesting them. Keep opening new tickets to get a new rep involved, they have a surprising amount of discretion in these regards and you may have just found the wrong one. Do a charge back and your account will be banned. You'll never use Uber again Uber is a snake company , they not only ripoff their drivers , they ripoff their paying customers as well. You can definitely dispute the charge with your bank, and yes uber will block your account but it is not for life. I had this happened and was able to reactivate my account after speaking to an uber representative. Also take screens it's of the map when it shows you are not in the destination you requested to be taken. I do this in case, sometimes they show arrived and start charging when they are at a light. You can attach photos when contacting ubers customer service. Damn that sucks dude, was it the wrong car or a pool ride?

Do a CC charge back / dispute or try calling again and say you never took the ride and don't know why location was different Do a charge back."

How reliable is the ETA for Uber drivers coming to pick you up?,10,33.53223664326524,uber,I called an Uber and it said that it was coming in 8 minutes and it came in 3 and I missed it . Normally I wouldn’t care but I’m a little low on money rn and I understand it’s kinda my fault because I should’ve kept track of the driver but I’m so use to the ETA being correct so I assumed it would’ve taken 8 minutes,"As a driver, my best guess is that the driver was heading the wrong way initially and found a way to get turned around faster than the built-in Google navigation thought they would.  It isn’t super common, but it does happen to me a few times a week. 

Generally they’re pretty reliable. Most of my significant deviations are actually the opposite way, due to traffic or navigation app errors. Request the ride when you're ready to leave, not when you're getting ready to leave, and be watching for the driver as you wait. Then this won't be an issue.      


Time is money for us. If we're sitting outside waiting in you, we're actively losing money. The biggest cause of this is when it thinks you are on a different street than you were actually on. The two biggest issues are when you are downtown and you are on a street that turns left into the destination, and the app thinks you are one street up and will have to do a big loop around because of one way roads and a street level light rail. Also if you are on the feeder and it thinks you are on the freeway, or vise versa. 

If I was trying to take an Uber somewhere and it was M-F 7-5 I’d expect the car to be just around the corner and be waiting to go because of this very thing. There should be three warnings, 2 mins away, they have arrived, and 2 mins have passed, sometimes the 2 mins away is skipped because you are less than 2 mins, but still, there should be notices. Essentially it really does not matter how accurate the estimate is. It’s an estimate, which means it’s not exact or reliable by definition. My son called for an Uber and the ride was picked up, eta showed as 12 minutes because they were completing a trip. He assumed he had time for a quick bathroom break. As soon as he got in there a different driver popped up whose ETA was a minute away. 

The lesson is don’t call an Uber until you are ready to go since you will never know. Each red light can be over a minute. In some residential areas, there are stop signs in every other small intersection. As far as I know, no navigation app takes those factors into account. So the ETA of Uber is rather generous to allow plenty of time for drivers. If the lower the ETA a lot more riders will complain about late drivers.

Isn't it good if the driver arrives early? I would check the app for that and send the driver a canned message asking him to wait. Even if the driver waited out the timer and cancel, you can ask support for a refund because they should have the ETA and when the driver cancelled. Or you can always save screen shots. It tends to overestimate the time in areas with a low amount of traffic lights, and underestimates it otherwise. Very common I get a ping in opposite direction I am traveling.Uber often gives a 1-2min loop as direction. I prefer a quick left into a business and get to you faster for obvious financial reasons. It’s supply and demand 

You could have drivers within 1 mins or more ... 

Only place uber order when you are ready to be picked up Passengers should never call an Uber until they're ready to go and are looking out for it.  Uber will sometimes re-pair you with a closer driver if one becomes available even after the original driver and ETA were assigned."

American 5-star rider rating tanked to 4.5 in South Africa. any tips on being a good and courteous rider?,43,33.802468124755,uber,"im an expat living in SA for the past five years. i don’t use Uber much since i live in rural wine country, but every chance i get when i’m in Cape Town i use both Uber and Uber Eats. the former bc driving myself increases my anxiety, the latter bc it’s less people i have to encounter. 

i just checked my rating today and it’s at a 4.5, which is bonkers bc i always

1. watch app *closely* and walk out towards them when they approach. look at license plate, confirm match, get inside and tell them my name. *i have never made my driver wait more than 2 mins tops and that was only bc my elevator wasn’t coming after several minutes and i was on the 8th floor*
2. always greet my drivers by name both as a courtesy and to confirm i am their passenger 
3. am quiet but respond to light conversation if necessary 
4. never have liquids with me but if i do, i keep it tightly to me and never place in a cup holder if it’s a shallow one 
5. compliment the cleanliness of the car and freshness if they have an air freshener (they usually do) 
6. thank them for driving me and tell them to drive safely when i exit 
7. tip well 


for uber eats, i always 
1. give explicit instructions on where to bring food 
2. meet them if i can (have ordered to a hospital room to which i was admitted and couldn’t meet, missed 1 delivery that way today)
3. smile and thank them for bringing me my food
4. tell them to drive/ride safely 
5. tip well 


i never tip in cash, usually bc i never carry cash. i’ve read that could increase my rating, as well as asking driver to exit out of ride while i’m in the car leaving. if i did that, i would put my phone beside his and show him i’m leaving him a 5-star rating too; quid pro quo.

is there anything missing from my list? i’m introverted and don’t like chatting a lot. i also have resting bitch face which could *easily* be misconstrued as rudeness coupled with the RBF. that’s why i greet them and say goodbye every time, plus my rides are short—nothing longer than 10 mins as they’re just hops from one part of the city to another. 

please let me know if i should add anything to my lists! really wanna boost my rating back up bc i really don’t wanna drop below 4 and be seen as a shitty customer you should avoid!","if you care so much about this you have bigger problems than what uber drivers think of you I’m facing this in the US.  Was a 5 star in several states, and now that I’m 2-months in SF I’m already down to 4.80.  I’m not letting it bother me, tho.  

I Uber at LOT.  The only things I can think of:

1. I don’t want to talk
2. I’m 6’3” and 225#, I’m a unit. I will not fit in your Maxda3 backseat.  Especially when I’m dressed for an event and have boots on.
3. No I’m not going to walk around the block to find you.

Finally, I’m not tipping every single driver.  If you’re above and beyond in some way, sure.  But I already paid for the damned ride, I’m not young again.  If Uber really isn’t paying fairly, stop taking their rides. Don’t worry about your rating. The relationship is that they work for you, you pay them. >always greet my drivers by name 

A few of my customers did this... I find it so weird. Its like we didn't even say hello to each other properly and some stranger on the street  calls me by my name through my car's window. 

Not saying its a bad thing but I always find it a bit weird if they just call me like that without asking if that's my name first.... maybe I'm the weird one.

Take into consideration that there's something called a ""revenge rating"" that Uber is actually aware of... or at least the  guys at the local Uber office here where I am.   

Customers have the ability to change their rating while drivers don't. And they think that a customer might check their rating and see it drop and wrongly assume one of their past drivers gave them a low rating so they'll go back and modify their rating for some random journey.... and I know a lot of drivers that have had 2-3 low rating during a day but swear they never had a customer who seemed dissatisfied ... so they sort of generate a typology of a customer who looks satisfied but is secretly pretentious and will give a low rating at the end.

In the UK where I am, outside London, a lot of drivers expect 3-4 stars from customers that seem to be from London and work a corporate job... apparently in the corporate world a 3 star is a good rating... so they just rate poorly those customers too.


I've also seen multiple drivers being constantly dissatisfied with Uber... you know that hate every company they work for because they think things should be done their way etc etc... so they would rate every customer 1 star . Eventually Uber got in touch with them and told them they won't be paired with any rider if they continue to show they hate everyone that gets in their car.

I found that in a lot of cases the ratings have nothing to do with the actual experience since there's no objective way that a ride should be rated and most people just give 5 stars while the rest will have their own way of deciding what a poor rating is and what is for.


You shouldn't stress yourself too much about your rating unless it drops under 4 stars. The only reason I know riders with close to 4 stars don't get picked up is if they're in a dodgy area at night or from a club on a saturday night as drivers will expect a less than pleasant journey. It’s definitely the short trips. there’s a good amount of drivers who will give a low rating for being 10 min or shorter. Fucked up but the unfortunate truth. I’m a driver in nyc but never gave a low rating for short trips and short trips make drivers the minimum fare rate which is usually between $5-$6. They just believe short trip customers are lazy 🤷🏽‍♂️ Racism!! > tell them to drive safely when i exit

This could easily be taken as a complaint, insult, or both. Just tip cash, it's that simple. Paint skin dark black. Let's see, 1) resting bitch face 2) short rides 3) never tip (tipping in app is the same as not tipping as far as ratings go). One thing to keep in mind is that the driver is forced to rate the rider immediately upon trip completion.  And that rating cannot be changed later.  So, since tips through the app don’t show up until after the rating, it might really help your situation if you made an effort to tip cash. Just ask them to rate you 5 stars lol In places where violent crime/enforcement against rideshare drivers is not uncommon, a 5-star rating is often viewed as a risk. Drivers will downrate riders as a signal to other drivers that the rider is not brand new/using a throwaway account to perpetrate crime."

Am I overreacting about my last driver?,12,34.30849821737243,uber,"I took an uber out from location A to location B, This was a 20+ minute ride but from the get-go this driver made me feel uncomfortable, I was tired, sick and just wanted to go home so I kept letting it slide. 

He started the ride by pulling up and telling me to sit in the passenger seat right away, without even asking where I'd like to sit, normally I take the back seat.  For the entire drive he kept talking about his personal life and making references to the fact that he was single and always looking for women (But how hard it was to find a good woman who wasn't stuck up) he kept asking me VERY personal questions and asked me if I was drunk, or pregnant (in reference to me not feeling well)

I felt really uncomfortable the longer the drive went on, and although he didn't do anything physical, I was afraid that if the ride had been any longer he may have tried something.  When we reached the drop off point he asked me for my number, and to hit him up if I was ever in the dating pool again, and also when I said I didn't have phone service he was like ""Oh, can you text me through wifi?"" 

Am I overreacting about this? Was my driver just being friendly and a little awkward or was he actually legitimately out of line in the way he was talking / acting towards me?","Any driver who is using the app as a dating service is out of line, report him That guy should not be driving. Report him. That is straight up creepy. If not you, he's going to try it with someone else. No, it was a negative interaction. Report and move on. Also no one can force you to sit up front. I’m a driver and I think this guy was out of line. Starting by telling you to sit up front. Unless you facilitated the conversation by responding readily to his questions and continuing the conversation, asking personal questions is inappropriate. You should have just said I’d rather not talk about this and kept quiet.

I don’t think it is at the level of harassment. I don’t think you should jeopardize his ability to drive by reporting him. But he certainly deserves a one star. Report him, and as a female never let a driver tell you where to sit. You can always just cancel and re-request to get another driver. Sometimes it may ping the same guy since he's closest but try a few more times or even swap to lyft if you have to. This driver is a fucking creep. So sick of hearing these pervy skeevy mother fuckers insisting women to ""sit in the front"". Asking for a number is out of line and very unprofessional. I’d report that. 

Talking about personal life is a 50/50 call and id error on the side of poor professional conversation skills. But generally I’d just not talk unless the passenger talks first. 

If he made you feel creepy with his actions, I’d report it. it’s super cringe and sketch that he asked you to sit in front. the most chatty drivers i’ve had just ask me where overseas i’m from, and then mention the weather maybe then leave it alone. that’s it. that’s the chattiest i’ve experienced without me initiating the convo. so yes, he was out of line and yes, like everyone else is saying, please report this whacko. He was definitely out of line, please message Uber about the occurrence. You are the consumer, you’re paying him, and he shouldn’t have been making you feel so uncomfortable. I had 1 driver out of the hundreds of rides ask for my phone number. Thing is, he wasn’t creepy, he was totally polite the entire trip. I let that slide as he had just moved here from another country and could have been unaware this was unprofessional. Your situation is different though and I understand it. When I’m exhausted after work it can be unbearable to be stuck in a car with someone who doesn’t know boundaries, is passive aggressive about their vehicle, etc. please report, they will at least not ever match you with this driver again. That guy was too friendly, sometimes as an Uber driver you have to know to respect all your customers no matter how shafted you are getting by the pay. Hopefully you get a better experience with different drivers."
2018 Uber passenger became my Mortgage lender.,23,34.43838247663169,uber,"Good thing I got that ping.  It is the only thing in Uber driving that I never regretted.  He told me is a mortgage lender and can get me approved for financing when I told him I am house hunting.  This is why I always enjoyed having some chat with passengers because you never know who you are talking to and how important they are.

Chad was the passenger and he gave me his business card and we met did the application and I got a loan approval letter so I did some shopping and bought a house through him when housing demand was beginning to sky rocket.  I bought the house for way cheaper than it is worth now, and I am about to do a cash-out refinance with him, he said I can get around $21,000 and my monthly payment will only go up around $130 which isn't bad at all.  My mortgage is like $648 now.  This means Chad will now get me $21K if my house appraises at the correct price.

So Chad did two great things for me.

Early morning trip from Fairfield County to Newark Airport in New Jersey - Will it be accepted?,16,34.50170423590198,uber,"Hey all,

I have an early morning flight in Newark Liberty International Airport. I plan to arrive at the airport around 6:15am to be safe. It's \~65 miles away. Google says it takes an hour, or hour-and-a-half to get there. My question is this: Can I be certain that a driver will accept this request at that hour? Should I use a traditional car service instead? I don't want to risk missing my flight, but Uber/Lyft is much cheaper.","Uber Pro has recently come to Connecticut, and any *Gold* or above driver should know how long your trip is before they accept it.  Many of us will go wherever the ride takes us, even if we [cross several states](https://imgur.com/a/ubyAEYC) in the process. You should be fine - just call your driver and let them know you’re heading to EWR as soon as you pair. If he says it’s okay then take it, if not tell him you understand and try again. 

Tip the guy at least $20 or 25% whichever is higher. These early morning rides can be tough as drivers get stuck in a rush hour location with no ride back You can preschedule the ride on Uber now for the desired time of your departure."
Getting an uber to airport early in morning difficult with no rating?,16,34.57798895812421,uber,"I live in a major city (Houston) and will need a ride to the airport early morning on a weekend but don't have a ride history. I took a ""practice"" ride on a Sunday and was super pleasant to him, gave him 5 stars, and tipped him in cash (although to be honest, the car smelled terrible), but I found out later that I need at least 5 rides before I get a score. 

Anyway, I'm about a half hour away from the airport and live in the city and not the suburbs but I'm curious whether I will have issues getting an uber ride at around 5 AM on a Sunday.  I've woken up around that time a few times and checked the app and it always shows 3 or 4 cars within 5 minutes of me in the map but I don't know if those are actual ubers or ghost images as I've heard some people say they are. 

So anyway, if I want to get to the airport by 6 AM, and I'm a half hour away,  should I feel confident I'll get an uber if I request one at 5 AM or should I try it earlier.   I'm guessing a lot of the drivers were working late night for all the bars and club riders so I'm worried a lot of them are tired and want to go home after 4 and they might see that I don't have a rating and just say ""screw it, I'm not going to deal with that"".","I would try to get a car at 4AM, just in case. (especially on a weekend) I would definitely set up accounts on both platforms Uber/Lyft and request the ride at 4am.   


I know with Lyft, you can even schedule the ride in advance. (not sure about Uber). You might consider doing that.   


Personally, as a driver, I don't really care about ratings or if the person is listed as ""new"". I'm only concerned if the person is extremely low rated, like a 4.0 rating.   


An airport run at that time with that distance should be appealing to anyone driving at that moment. Everyone automatically starts with a 5 star rating. Inside the beltway, you can get a ride.if you are near Baytown or Texas city, the wait time might be 20 mins at those times, but you can still get a ride.

I’d give yourself 30-45 mins time to get a ride, but you will be fine. 

Out towards Huntsville, you get issues with no cars, but X is almost always within 15 mins at all times inside the beltway. Use the scheduled ride function (little car+clock icon in the search bar), drivers will take the request more seriously at that time of day. You'll be fine. Hi, please check out the LYFT schedule ahead feature and use the code CLARISSA298 promo code for a $10-15 discount off your first ride.  Your ride will def be scooped up quickly since it will be a good longmile trip for drivers.  As a female driver I prefer working for Uber but when I go out drinking I ALWAYS use LYFT, i don't know why, personal pref I guess. Good luck!"

Call Uber. You may have been hacked. Check your email for receipts.

Do you use the same password on other websites and apps? https://haveibeenpwned.com/ I had this happen to me today.  ~$160 worth of charges and I have never used Uber nor do I have an Uber account.

I have a question regarding riding through an uber,30,35.20576673591302,uber,"So I am currently a 17 year old working a part time job but the law required to ride through an uber is 18, is this true? I just need the uber to drop me off at work and then my dad will pick me up.","Yup, the TOS states you must be 18 to ride, or have someone who is 18 or older ride with you. Do you have any friends who are older that can ride with you? If I see a pickup at a high school, I’m asking for ID, if I see a pickup at 7:45-9:00am at a house and they look like they are under 20, I’m asking for ID, if they are around lunch and near a high school, I’m texting beforehand asking if they are going back to school, I ask for ID. If they “forgot it at home” I’m canceling with an Unaccompanied minor flag. i was in Los Angeles, had an uber carpool with a kid in middle school. guess his parent organized the ride for him bc i was shocked. Tel the drivers you are 18 if they ask you. Most drivers won’t ask for id as long as you don’t look like you’re 12 years old tbh op i ride when i miss school and i’m 17 as well, they don’t ask ages, i’m sure they just want you to pay them not get all technical and i doubt anyone goes by the that rule anyways I drove.  I had a car at 16.  I drove my friends all over the place.  Get a friend with a car and pay them for rides. >off

Just be a good human, be at the pin at the pick up location when your driver shows up, sit in the back passenger side, do not slam the door and by all means leave at least a small tip... do all that and you will be fine young man. I am already impressed that you cared enough to even ask on here, hop on in :) Here in Oklahoma you can work at age 16 but can't get an uber or lyft to get to that work until age 18. Yes, you are still underage, thus considered a minor.  If the driver accepts you, they are simply accepting ALL the risks that go with it, starting with NO insurance, as the driver is doing a ride against Uber/Lyft policy.  So, in a moment of an accident, the driver is without insurance, and so are you, so don't play the 'oh, my neck' or be really hurt, because that is your hospital bill!"
Why do drivers wear (non-driving) gloves?,20,35.210894050741636,uber,"I’ve noticed more and more of my drivers have been wearing winter and other forms of gloves while driving... 

It’s not cold out, etc where I live. Is there a reason so many drivers have started doing this? 

Context: I uber 2-4 times a day for work, and see this almost daily lately.","I don’t know for sure. But maybe since they are in the car and blasting the a/c all day so people don’t give bad ratings their hands might be cold. I've been thinking about getting gloves just cause my steering wheel is uncomfortable to hold all day. I got a steering wheel cover but it made the steering wheel harder to get a good grip on over time. i notice bus drivers do the same thing. It is mostly used to increase grip on the steering wheel from driving all day to reduce getting the steering wheel all sweaty I had an Uber driver one time wearing surgical gloves Wheel grip. It's easier. Plus, shields hands from sun. Prevents sun spots, etc.. I’ve thought about getting some because no matter what direction I put my vents my hands are freezing within 5 minutes in the car What does it matter to you?"
Are third world countries ratings given less weight?,9,35.28054682851942,uber,My passenger rating has tanked from 4.93 to 4.86 and honestly the drivers here are kinda assholes. Uber is illegal here so they have a monopoly on app taxis and they know that. I just don’t want this to affect my US passenger rating,"Why are you so concerned? This makes no difference.

If you want a better rating just kindly ask then to close the ride in front of you before leaving the car and you will get you good rating back after a few rides. 4.86 is high.  3rd world countries drivers get easily deactivated if they dare mess with you or do funny stuff like hide a few blocks away while they wait for cancel fee.  I take it in Egypt often and stay 5.0 plus I throw a tip in app for then which is like cents in U.S. dollars, but fine in their eyes Most likely it’s about tips, try with tipping in cash if you haven’t been doing so As a Driver 
Best way for passenger to get great rating
Sit in the back
Not every driver like passenger in the front beside them. 
Second say hello and end there 
Depending on how long driver been driving that day. Passenger always start the same with question. Gets to be annoying.
That's it really if you think about 
Sit in the back greet say your preference in direction.

Scrape uber ride fare vs time of day. Anyone who's done this before?,2,35.301472754456384,uber,I'm wondering if anyone has every created a database of a ride route vs fare of uber rides. I think it is possible to use Uber APIs to access the fare of a ride with the pickup and drop-off points. I couldn't find anything substantial with a light google search. Has anyone done anything similar?,"""I couldn't find anything substantial with a light google search.""

Yeah this data is proprietary and they will not share it.  So google away, the only way you see the data is to connect with all the drivers (aka impossible). What do you want to know?  How much Uber/Lyft keep versus how much the drivers get?  Simple, ask... there is a base, mile, and time to get what the drivers take home.  Oh you mean for you, the user, how you can save even MORE money?  Get a yellow cab, and pay the cab driver, then get an Uber/Lyft and do the same route, see how much cheaper it was using Uber/Lyft?  Who do you think is not making money?  The company?   Heheheheh... the driver?  Yup!"
"Uber started taking tips now?? Did a short distance minimum fare ride ($3.76) I received a notification saying I got a $5 tip. But my total earnings was $5 instead of $8.76 WTF Uber.

Uber's Nightmare Has Just Begun,7,35.515789884097046,uber,Image,"**Uber makes plenty of money**, their issue is that mentally, they are still living in the 'silicon valley funding round' days where money just falls out of the sky that they did not have to earn. 

They ran around and rented gorgeous offices in the most expensive city in the US, filled it full of designer furniture and perks, paid people double what even that inflated local market suggests is reasonable, and then throws billions away every year on autonomous tech R&D that they are not qualified to manage when they could just leave it to others and license the tech when it matures.

They have no idea what it is to be frugal. I've been involved in a few shops that were fast tracking to go public and/or IPO and we were fucking FRUGAL. We re-used our photocopy paper. OK? 

Cheapest rent in the the cheapest cities and we paid below market wages but gave everyone a nice ESOP share plan.

Every dollar on the balance sheet equals X dollar valuation when you go public. And we made money within 6 months of launch. Uber had to spend a huge percentage of revenue litigating it's way into markets and once that was over, instead of using that money to grow or expand into other areas, they threw it at stuff that's not going to pay them any ROI for possibly 5 or 10 years - if ever. 

From my POV, it appears they believed they could get that autonomous tech approved much sooner, and bet the farm on it. Only time will tell if it was the right decision but if all the drivers were about to get 86'd in the next year or three- why is California trying to litigate our status?

My read is that we are not even close to widespread use of self driving cars, even in places like the south and southwest that get no snow. (big failure in the current tech is when it snows you lose visual markers).

I do not believe the current combination of GPS + cameras + sensors will yield a accident rate that is below current numbers produced by human drivers for some time. Please note that the goal is not to get to ZERO accidents, just to match current numbers. At that point it becomes a insurance issue.

Now, once you get 5G rolled out nationwide and put  RFID tags in every reflector in the road way and on the curbs along with the computing infrastructure to support it, you will see numbers that support driverless cars. 

It will cost a small fortune and some other company will probably be the ones rolling that out. Maybe one of the big wireless co's like Verizon - they are already on the ground installing radios and racks, just add another couple racks to the existing installation and sub out the actual roadwork to a (you guessed it) **1099 subcontractor.** I hate Forbes - it used to be a fun source of wealth for Forbes 100 or top wealthiest people - now it seems like a Cosmo or a teen magazine or a blog.

Such one sided lousy reporting This story is why I hate reading financial stories from people who have zero fucking idea how companies work. 

First I think Uber is a fucking shit show, and yes the number of errors it makes in some things is cringeworthy. 

1) driver pay isn’t “driver pay” it covers all the expenses of running a car. Uber knows this, but they put this shit in there earnings reports to cover the reality that there isn’t much more to squeeze on the driver end and cover the problem that, this cost doesn’t go away with self driving cars, they have to pay for the car somehow. But we all know that and I’m moving on. 

2) an IPO valuing a company at $9 billion doesn’t mean the company has $9 billion dollars. Much of that is share trades from pre IPO holders who used to own pre IPO shares who then own post IPO shares. Let’s say half the shares or more went to previous owners, that leaves $4.5 billion. It also leaves out cash that can be borrowed. But yeah. Write it up like they are almost out of money. 

There is no minimum wage for ICs and that is meaningless the way the app currently works. I agree that fares are too low, but bringing up minimum wage missed the point, this isn’t a clock in, work at a company supplied desk, clock out job. It’s like having a little mini business. Cost control is everything, as are a ton of other variables. The rates are not good. But don’t make a stupid comparison to minimum wage. If we want minimum wage, go work at McDonald’s they are always hiring and you can make $7.25 an hour. 

I miss the old days when Forbes used to have business writers who knew anything about business. "" Uber’s biggest expense is driver pay. **It pays back to drivers about 80% of all the money it generates.** ""

Really? No. BS."
Longest Uber ride you’ve given/taken?,30,35.51959775448121,uber,"I happened to take a guy from DC into Delaware (about 3 hours one way) and it spurred the question. What’s the longest ride you’ve given/taken? As a driver do you like this long rides? I personally always enjoy longer trips (no down time searching for rides, in general I feel like the longer the trip the more likely a tip).","I'm in Miami Beach and I got pulled into one of the big resorts and asked to drive a dudes luggage to Orlando. Not him, just his luggage. Nice peaceful ride of approx 250 miles. Had to negotiate a proper gratuity to get me home (+$100) as turnpike tolls alone are $25 + 3 hour ride + tank of Gas. They understood.

Netted approx $175 on the app via the ride up + $100 tip  = $275 total income.

Take out  $25 tolls and $25 gas coming back and it was about a  $225 ""net net"" ride.

They gassed me up and fed me on the ride up. Took about 8 hours RT. 

10/10 Would do it again. Western Wisconsin to Chicago and back. Over $500 for me. LAX -> santa barbara, 100 miles From a town near Annapolis MD to JFK airport at 11pm. Made $230. Didn’t get home til 9am after taking a nap in a NJ rest area. Depends on the area, for some long ass rides you are crossing your local partner regions and not being able to get a fare on the way back. For example I am in NJ and there are long ass rides into NYC or PA which means I am screwed on the return fare back for additional tolls  depending on which method is fastest and cheapest method get back to Jersey. Then there's the aggrevation with dealt with NYC traffic which doesn't die until 8PM weekdays or 2AM weekends. Atlanta to Nashville. They didn't tip but hey I got white Castle for the 1st time in YEARS Western Wisconsin to Chicago and back. Over $500 for me. I live in the boonies (Shenandoah County, Virginia). My favorites are the long ones. So far, round trip from Front Royal, VA to Hagerstown, MD, RT from Woodstock, VA to Martinsburg, WV, one way from Winchester, VA to Waldorf, MD, OW from Winchester, VA to BWI airport. 3hrs 15 Min. Port Canaveral FL, to Miami FL, and I've done this twice actually :) and yes I enjoy the longer rides it's more peaceful than the daily grind. One time as a driver I went from Hollywood to Riverside one night. However, halfway there and the kid was like “I forgot my room key” so we had to go back to Hollywood and then go back out towards riverside. I forget how long in total it was Houston to Austin, ~3 hours and 160 miles. Guy missed his connecting flight and had to drive to Austin. 
~ $125 in fare and he tipped me $150 to get back. I ended up staying in Austin for the weekend and made another $500. so $775 is not a bad haul for a 3 day run. 1 hour. Any more than that and I make them pay in cash off the app, no way am I letting uber take $50-$100 for 5KB worth of data tracking the app. 14 years.. got married in that ride too! Longest was 1.5 hours.  Market is large, and I never seem to get the far ones.  I'm also in central America where everyone has their own cars to do road trips on Went from NYC to the jersey shore. Round trip it totaled 6 hours and  costed about $400. I’m from NJ and my driving permit was about to expire, Eatontown NJ was the only DMV with a test slot open before my permit became invalid. Worth the money because I passed the driving test and said goodbye to ubering! Vermont to Connecticut. 4 hr 2 min ride down. 241 miles. $263.20 in app. No tip. 

Took me far longer to get home because I stopped for food, then to see a friend that lives 2 hours away from me and was along my way home. Then slept in my car about halfway because I got way too tired. I took a pax from DIA to Vail once. I was like oh this is ok only an hour and a half plus it’s early I should get a ride back. Yeah it snowed massively adding 2 hours did no ride back. I should have ended the ride the second I saw snow. Philly to the jersey shore. ~70 miles, 100 bucks Christmas Eve one year I got a 99.9 mile (**so** close!) one-way trip. He did tip $40."

Why do you do Uber

What time are you working until

Have you been busy...

It's human nature, just small talk to while away the time because humans don't communicate with each other, what are you?  A dolphin? Well... I can't speak for everyone, but I use a couple generic questions to

1. Evaluate you for safety reasons.

2. Judge the level of your chattiness. 

You know the number one way to avoid conversation with any driver? Headphones. As a driver, I dont ask too many questions over "" how are you"". Its annoying. Drivers get chatty hoping to get friendly and get a tip. As I driver I feel ppl out. Put headphones on and sit in back. They are just trying to be friendly/human. Lol, just don't respond. Most drivers will get the cue that you don't want to engage in small talk. Pretty common for morning business pax and airport runs.

Social skills +1. I understand where you're coming from, it can definitely get annoying, ""do you take ubers all the time"" ""is that not expensive"" ""I wish I got paid enough to take ubers everywhere"".. um that's my issue not yours to worry about. And especially in the AM even if i do have headphones in they try to make conversation. The driver is performing a service. It's kind of weird to do it in complete silence, as if there were no one in the car with you. It can feel awkward.  I always give 5 stars. The only time I don't tip is when driver is interrogating me trying to create conversation where none is wanted.

I'm not going to tell you why I'm taking Uber. I'm not telling you if I just got off work.  The length of time I've lived in town is none of your business."

You could try opening up a ticket and claiming the dropoff point was on a bridge or edge of a cliff or something ridiculous just to sell the point that it is dangerous, they might be able to push a button that resets the point a mile away or whatever. Otherwise you may have to just eat the few bucks and take a private uberX for the time being. Call your cities Code Enforcement and Animal control.

She wasn't using services provided by Uber at the time of the ride. She essentially got into a strangers car and accepted an off the record ride in exchange for cash, I don't think she has a case against Uber."
"uber won't let me drive, application full of defects.",3,36.49681997678346,uber,"Wondering if this is just me or other's are having this issue:

My largest complaint is that I am trying to deliver passengers, not just uber eats. I talked to their uber eats support and was told to use a different email address/account to drive passengers with uber.  This seems counter intuitive to everything I've read and it should be a setting in the app.  (Additionally, she talked down to me like I was an low IQ infant, even though basic logic was not her strong suite.)  She kept stating that it's a different department and they do not have phone support.  She was very unhelpful and demeaning to be frank!

&#x200B;

\-Uber app only lists my vehicle as a bike.  I have added my prius multiple times (in app an web) and still listed as ""uber bike""

\-Only able to get uber eats delivery.  I have watched videos on changing this setting in the app, but there is no setting to change to pick up uber passengers

\-multiple places in app to 'get help' but no help available.  

\-I had to call their emergency line because it said 'your account is temp blocked' when I logged in.  Upon signup on the app it would not let me add my social security number. (the example contained dashes, but the app would not let me add dashes and complained of missing SS #) Support must have unblocked me, I am able to login now, but having many problems.

\-the 'report app issues' link takes me to a screen that just says ""You don't have any app issues pending"", but no way of opening a support case.

\-Instant Pay denies me. I have very good credit, but the GoBank denied me.  I have set up my routing and account so I will see in a week if I get paid.

\-The uber eats app routes me to restaurants that are closed in the area. This annoyed the Sheri's staff and they say this happens frequently but UberEats has not fixed this. This was a wasted 4 mile drive for me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the end, I can live with these issues, I just want to drive passengers.  Additionally, I'm pretty shocked that a company such as Uber that prides itself on providing the technology behind the service end and takes 1/3 to half of the profit could have a barely functioning application full of defects and an unreachable support staff that has such disdain or respect for the employees.","Do you have a hub near you, or can you plan a trip to one? You'll always get better support there. When I initially signed up I accidentally signed up for Uber eats. You’ll have to create a new account (Uber X) in order to drive passengers. I had my ears account deleted but it’s still in the system which fucks me up when I call support and need to confirm my account.

Once you have an Uber X account you can drive both eats and normal passenger rides. Try Lyft"
This is why we Eats drivers can never stay at 95% or more acceptance rating. Things like Chefs forgetting a topping and other stuff we have no control over get UberEats ratings hits,22,36.50206303233902,uber,Image,"As a driver (both UberX and UberEats) in Portland Oregon, it’s clear they are having real trouble getting Eats drivers at certain times of days.  I’m constantly being offered deliveries from McDonalds and similar that are 20-30 minutes away.  Occasionally they Troy to lure me with a minimum guarantee  it’s ridiculous. here is the link to that review site: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/ubereats.com There are three services being used: 

The delivery, the cuisine itself, and the app. All three should have their own ratings I did it 6 times before giving up.  No tips either. Hahahahahaha. Uber has 1 star, basically same level as a scam business but requires drivers and delivery workers to maintain an unruly high rating! What a joke! What does Ubereats rating on some website have to do with your acceptance rate? Does this website control what you do and do not accept? What I hate is when you guys forget to include a straw.  I mean that is something you can actually control.  Makes me wonder if you used my straw to take a sip and then had to throw it away to not get caught. Yeah if you want to have food delivered, Bitesquad is the way to go.

For example, if uber forgets a part of your meal you will have to pay usually for it anyway. That happens way too frequently. Or if an item is out of stock they just will deliver all the things but that and you will be charged for it anyway.

If something is missing at bitesquad, it's the duty of the delivery driver to check. You'll get a call about what to do about it.

I always tip well, too, with bitesquad. 3-5 per delivery. If you aren't making any money doing eats, try switching to bitesquad. I see the same people a lot so I know it has to be worth while."

Driver & Passenger ratings,5,36.9612991434722,uber,"Does anyone else find it sorta funny when people post on here about whatever they’re complaining about then always bring up their ratings? I have 4.92 or 4.7 I have 5 stars so I don’t know what’s going on Uber won’t refund me, Uber wouldn’t pay me cuz a passenger maid a mess. Support wouldn’t answer the phone. I don’t think a lot of people understand that their ratings mean nothing. Most of the time passengers don’t rate or forget. Drivers are required to rate and just click 5 stars because it’s the default option and are in a rush to get to next rider. I feel like a lot of drivers and passengers feel like they’re more entitled because of their good ratings but not actually. Everyone deals with the same stuff regardless of ratings or Uber pro status as a driver or a passenger. The support sucks in all tiers. The only difference is they answer the phone faster. Lol",Ratings is the secret trick Uber uses to hook Pax and drivers. Ratings matter becuz a pax might cancel after they are assigned a driver that they believe is rated too low.

I never tip... will that probably give me a bad rating?,23,37.01046581014991,uber,I never even really thought about tipping... I dont have much money and it already costs me  7-15$ to go somewhere so I can only take uber's once in a while because of that...I'm always very thankful and polite to drivers and say thank you like 4 times (once when I open the door once when I get in once when we stop and once when I close the door) I have a 4.78 rating maybe that's why its not a 5 because I dont tip? I'd love to tip and I'm sorry I dont but when it's an optional tax I rather not because i can spend that something I really need or sometimes I cant because i dont have much or any cash at all to give,"Very few will rate low for lack of tip.
If your not rude or slamming doors,then most likely your low ratings come from odor. Ether smoke,or strong  body odor are fast low re ratings Do you also never tip when you go to a restaurant? Not tipping won’t get you a bad rating because the driver doesn’t know if you tipped or not before he has to rate you. However consider that Uber doesn’t pay their drivers very much and they are relying more and more on tips to supplement their income. Even a $1 tip is much appreciated. I found the Baptist In general you should tip $2-3 for the small fares, that aside your rating of 4.8 is ok - tipping has nothing to do with it because we find out after if you have or haven't

We live in service world therefore should be tipping Are you always ready to go and waiting when the driver arrives? 4.78 is low enough that it's not just the lack of tips. My landlord doesn't accept rent in ""thank yous"". If you can afford a $7 Uber, you can afford an $8 Uber. Tip a buck, don't be an asshole. If you don’t have the money.  Just be nice and polite. Be waiting at the pick up spot when requesting the ride. Don’t say I’ll tip you in the app then don’t. Nah we won’t care.

Was I a shitty passenger ?,20,37.49384543981541,uber,"It was raining I had no coat missed the last train. I wouldn't normally get a long uber journey but didn't have much choice.

So I ordered an uber and as an expat who has lived in 5 countries I often experience inflated prices everywhere as I guess they assume I'm rich by my accent which I'm not.... so I sit in the back of taxis checking the route the whole journey on my phone. I always tip as well.

My  driver took me a longer route inflating the cost by 25 percent. I pointed it out and he got angry. 

When I left the car I gave him a 1 star rating didnt tip him and then contacted uber who adjusted the price to what it should have been originally. His uber rating was high.

I felt like a knob afterwards as I'm not sure if it was intentional or not on his part. The driver clearly has a long day by his reaction but I can't accept constantly paying inflated prices so have to draw the line somewhere.","I'm ok with longhauling so long as the pax doesnt pay for it. If your bill was recalculated then that means the driver blew through all of Uber's allowance and then some, as uber will even go into the negative to keep your fare the same. For your bill to increase 25% means the driver probably drove 50% out of the way. Fuck him, you did fine. Now if he's just jumping on a beltway loop or something that may only add a few minutes to the trip just let the man drive, his reasons could be for more than just jacking up the bill. Not sure if he did this on purpose but sometimes the gps does make drivers take a longer route or less preferred route. So he could’ve just been following what the app tells him as not all drivers are familiar with the area they’re driving in and could be from a different part of town cuz Uber takes drivers everywhere. 

But if you did point it out and ask him to take a different route I don’t know why he wouldn’t, and why he got angry. Unless maybe by the time you pointed it out, it was to late to make a difference. I dunno. Your response would be an overreaction if it was a minor incident. But your situation doesn't seem like one. 


Yes, accidents happen. But that doesn't excuse the driver (/those who made the mistake) from taking responsibility. Sometimes it can be a quick fix, sometimes it can't. 


I've had a similar experience with a driver who accidentally turned a 10-15min drive into one that lasted almost an hour. He claimed to know better than the GPS, and he was wrong. 


Did he mean to take one of the worst possible routes to get there? No. But he still made a mistake that cost me not only a lot more money, but also my appointment. No, drivers who do this suck and the ones here who support them are even worse. Uber knows if he followed the planned route in the app. So they know that he took a way longer route than he was supposed to. You were. You should've let the driver know ahead of time that you have a preferred route. Heck, you should let the drivers know ahead when you order the ride to see if they will accommodate your request. Most drivers shouldn't have to switch in the middle of a ride to merely please you. Also, there could have been a variety of reasons they avoided the original route-- (i.e., accidents, speed traps, ghost traffic (i.e., not accounted for in Waze/Google Maps), difficult intersections, accident-prone/unsafe areas, narrow roads). You don't drive professionally. THEY do.

Stop making the faulty assumption that they are trying to ""inflate the price."" This is a fallacy per se. have you considered the possibility that going the way you wanted him to could have been a clusterfuck? the app tends to get us to go the fastest way which can sometimes be more mileage. maybe he saved you money by not sitting in some bullshit construction zone or traffic. Yeah you're an asshole I know where you're coming from. I've paid the ""white"" price in many other countries. It's whatever. 

In your case giving him a 1 star and getting mad is unnecessary. It doesn't serve you or him any good. 

Walk away and file the dispute with Uber. They'll fix the price and everyone moves on with their day without stress.

Whether he did it on purpose or not doesn't matter. What matters is the human outcome in the end. He feels better. You feel better. Uber eats a dick. We all move on."

# Lyft/Uber offering free rides to/from Hurricane evacuation shelters... screw driver safety

📷 

I  swear these kale smoothie chugging P R dorks never cease to amaze. $20  discounted rides. Imagine toting multiple pax with pets,pillows, food,  water, luggage, precious mementos, etc. to an evacuation center with a  traffic jam at the drop off. By the way no storm surge for drivers ( pun  intended). They will ""tip in the app"". SMFH","no one is making you do anything champ. If you're that concerned about your safety drive yourself to a shelter and wait it out. I wouldn't drive if I thought it was unsafe. I would rather be over here breaking my back ferrying evacuees around with their precious mementos than the alternative- families, whole houses, getting washed out to sea. Don’t drive. YES! You too can do your part as a fellow citizen and help your community who desperately needs you. 

Isn't  it GREAT that Uber& Lyft are offering FREE rides to the public YET still paying YOU? 

CMON! Get off your fat assess and get that chedda! You can't sit there and watch a 1 mph storm on TV for the next 3 days!  **Service equals Citizenship! Would you like to know more?**

For those that want to know - Free round trips valued at up to $20 each way to and from state-approved shelters around the state.

Uber cars are fake and merely meant to represent availability. Lyft cars interestingly are very real and only lag maybe 20 seconds behind what you see. I've even accidentally stalked some when staking out a waiting area. Very possible. I was on a very long industrial road a few weeks ago. Uber showed two cars near me.

Anxiety issues,12,38.03013016205971,uber,"Hello everyone , I have been driving Uber in the Maryland area ( stay out of Baltimore ) for the past year. I have about 900 trips under my belt with a 4.94 rating. I tend to stay in the counties outside of Baltimore to do my best to avoid troublesome pax, which results in longer fares which I enjoy. When I first started , As many freshmen would , I would accept every ping I received. Fast forward a few months and no major incidents have happened but I have learned to never accept anything lower than 4.80. Recently About a month or so ago I picked up a passenger who acted like no passenger I have had before. She got into my car , did not respond to my “ hey, how are you today “ and threw her bag into my car. Not ever dealing with something like this before I foolishly started the ride and drove for about a mile before my I could feel my anxiety building to a boiling point , having picked up such a scumbag of a passenger. I inform the girl and her boyfriend that I am canceling the ride and bringing them back home. Once I drive them back a mile to their house , they refuse to leave my car until they see that the money is returned into their Uber account for the ride. When they refuse to leave my car , I take the keys and call the police outside. They send a car and they get out just before the police arrive. After that incident , I became so cautious of who I pick up. I always keep all my doors locked , when the passenger get in my car I wait to say hello and make sure they respond respectfully before I start the trip , or I will have no problem saying “ get the fuck out of my car you arrogant prick” to the next passenger who tries to disrespect a driver by completely ignoring their hello. It has gotten to the point no where I almost get anxiety attacks the closer I get a pax , ever since that terrible experience. I really enjoyed driving before this incident , but this anxiety is getting worse every day.","Anxiety attacks, having a meltdown over failure to say ""hi"". Something is wrong with you & this may not be the best source of income for you. You're there to carry someone from A to B, not have a damn ice cream social along the way. Ok Thats totally your problen and a complete overreaction honestly, see a therapist if your anxiety is that bad. 1\* and select ""disrespectful"" . Not everyone wants to talk, I have learned this, So I say hey hows it going and with no response just drive. Those are actually my favorite rides, no forced akward conversation. Its easy as fuck! I have an anxiety disorder and I'm a passenger ...I feel that may have gave me a bad rating once or twice because I may seem a little weird... one time it was really hot out and I was sweating through my clothes and after going out that day I realized my shoes smelled... that gave me quite a bit of anxiety... it was the only time I had a female driver too ...nice older lady and I felt bad she had to pick me up at a courthouse so she already probably thought I could've been a bad person As a lifetime native of downtown I encourage you to please stay out of Baltimore. Thanks. Try and get some kratom or ashwagandha it will help with anxiety. There is one rule to remember.  Someone below a 4.9, has fucked one of your fellow drivers in the past, without lube.

My card was recently charged by UBER but I have not used Uber in a few months,9,38.199586180589264,uber,Description says it all but I’ve tried contacting Uber’s customer services an they have yet to respond how do I resolve this,"Why not talk to your credit card company instead?

There is a weakness in uber somewhere. Uber knows it as this has been going on for a long long long time. Just no one has been able to prove it's a fault in the uber app. You need to change your cc info out , your card have been compromise , also your account have been compromised, change password Maybe you didn’t tip your driver well."
One-starred for not immediately bringing back a phone to a paxhole's house,72,38.35757229170038,uber,"Uber needs to disable ratings from passengers who file a lost item report. I'm not dropping everything to get your stuff back when you want it, I'm doing it on my time. The fact that I was willing to deliver it straight to you despite living 40 miles away should have netted me 5* and a hefty tip (to be fair to them, I did get $45 out of it, but the 1 star is absolutely not deserved)","You drove 40 miles? What the fuck? Throw their shit out or give it to the police station. You need to get an RF shield bag from Amazon for under $10.

As soon as you find the phone in your car it goes into the bag...

This way they can't track their phone (even more so to your home) and you don't answer any lost item reports until it's convenient for you even if that is several days later.

$45 isn't enough to deal with the BS. I'm at the point I take the Phone, factory reset it, take it to Walmart and drop it in the Cell Phone Purchase machine and take whatever it's wroth Send it on the mail.. They would 1 \* Mommy for not making them a P B & J and hand delivering it to their basement hovel hole within 5 minutes. Now you know where they live.... retaliate. Was the $45 part of the original charge? Or was it the fee to return the item?
In my area returning an item is worth $15. I agree with you that the rating system needs to be modified. When an unexpected situation happens then ratings should be removed. Good or bad. You should only be rated on normal drives. 
I’ve returned around a dozen items. 
Best practice is to look in your car before you leave but stuff gets missed. 
Last I heard you can drop off at an Uber facility as well. sounds like someone who should be gps tracking their phone through a garbage dump yard.  You should have done the duty and dumped in the trash. Absolutely appalled at some of these rude drivers in this thread, how dare you not even attempt to return someone's fucking phone, what the fuck is wrong with you idiots Should have kept the phone"

Question from someone who hasn't used Uber yet,25,38.50048895839188,uber,"I just lost my transportation to work at the moment. Can I get an Uber at 4 AM or a bit later? Or is that too early for any Uber driver anywhere? I'm not trying to be unreasonable with the time, that's just when I'd have to leave for work and I am at a loss for options. Thank you! EDIT:Nearest large city , St. Louis MO, is about 30 mins drive from me for reference.","Depending on your city size you should be good. Do both apps Uber and Lyft. Tip your driver. Depending on your location there should be Uber drivers near you almost 24/7. You can also schedule a ride for around the time you need to be picked up. I've been in a business area and received a ping to pick someone up in an affluent residential area. They were 15 minutes away, but they were going to the airport so it was well worth the pick up. Definitely on the first few days try to get the uber 15-30 minutes early so you can figure out how fast it takes for an uber to get to your location usually at that time of night, and then from there you can figure out how long you need to be ready for usually Tip your driver always, time is good..lyft you can schedule  a ride.. uber you hope Depends where you are but where I am, it's always possible to get a ride at 4am. I'd expect to wait a bit longer than average, but still not longer than 10 minutes. I've done this to get to the airport many times. This really depends on where you live. If it's Los Angeles you'll be fine. I called an Uber for my mom at 4am before Use both Uber and Lyft. Experiment - meaning give yourself extra time on the first day, and get a sense of how long it takes at 4 am for your city.

Short answer - almost everywhere there are drivers on the streets at 4 am. You may be able to schedule a ride at that time I do drives at 4 am myself. Don't listen to the liars saying there aren't any You can request for a future date right in the app. As long as your not in the middle of no where, 4 am shouldn't be a problem. Tip the driver
. People need to know drivers dont make much money because UBER takes a lot. Depends on your area.  I, as a driver, usually START my days at around 3:50AM to get the busy business people to the airport.  I always call the rider ahead and tell them that I am on my way to the airport, as RIDESHARE should be, if they say someplace else, it is up to me if I cancel or not.  If they are going back home, automatic cancel.  If they sound drunk, I don't even say have a good day, cancel.  Remember to always tip your driver! Nope. 4am is too early. Drivers like to start around 9 Uber ceases operating at 6pm, starts up again at 8am."

    Xoxo","Wut? You can tell if it's a normal phone call through your carrier or via the app via the internet. There's no charge in the latter case.

The caller always pays. Unless somebody warns you that it's a collect call. Uber always use VOIP at their end so they never have to pay international calls. WTH is a trainer? Is that a bra for tiny girls?"

I’ve never Ubered before— is it safe to use it to transport expensive items?,19,39.44746812509442,uber,I’m a college student without a car. Getting a pc. Need to go to my nearest store to actually pick the stuff up. Is Uber safe for this?,"Yea it’s fine. A PC  isn’t too large mist drivers don’t mind You'll get the drivers information in the app and you can screenshot it and send it to a friend or family member in case something happens. But no driver is going to lose their job and 100% get caught, over a computer. Are you serious? Duh. There are like 2 million drivers ofcourse  there are going to be some bad apples....but its is safe as any other  mode of transportation.. Why would it not be?

It’s not a third world delivery company (stfu about eats)

You will be in the car right?

So think about this, you go buy your $199 HP POS, now you order an Uber and then what happens? Someone comes and picks you up in a car that they had to buy that costs at least 10Xs of times what you paid for your laptop. 

Then you think they might go “give me that pos laptop. I need to run some shit over.”

And you like a little bitch hand it over, “Please mister, I spent my $200 life savings on that and I want to play fortnight!” 

Then he says, “No, only bitches play fortnight!” then he sticks it in front of his wheels and runs over it back and forth. 

“Haaa, haa, ha. Now you will have to work another 12 years at your phone kiosk to buy another laptop. Next time get something that runs PUBG, bitch!” 

And he peels out flinging the carcasses your dead laptop at your head knocking you unconscious and then you got shanghaied and forced to work as a pirate off the coast of Somalia. 

Are you going to be this big a bitch for the rest of your life?

You realize how many people bring laptops with them everywhere right? 

Here is what is going to happen, someone who is probably doing their best to make ends meet will accept your request, they will pull up to Best Buy where they will pickup someone acting crazy about their purchase and they will wonder what is wrong with this person. Why are they so jumpy. Is this dude high? Probably. It’s 2:00pm and they have bloodshot eyes and are just waiting to get jizz stains on themselves. Let’s just hope they don’t do something strange on this ride. 

They drive for 10 mins drop you off and then you run for the safety of your dorm room that houses hundreds of students who are short on cash and don’t have a digital footprint leading to them should they want pawn your $200 laptop off for $25 for beer money. 

Then the Uber driver picks up a business man who is wearing a $1,000 suit, $400 tumi bag, $2,500 laptop, $1,500 phone, and $500 in cash on them and takes that person to the airport so they can maybe get a $10 tip. And they wonder what the fuck was up with the college student? No. you should be spending your money on a car, not a PC.  Stop gaming and get out into the world."
Be Warned: You MAY want to routinely cash out because Uber is stealing from you.,18,39.68507229177212,uber,"So last night I cashed out, needing to money for the holiday and this morning I noticed that the account t was -5.69. I called them and I'm told it was an adjustment for a pool for Friday. I took ONE pool on Friday where I got paid 8.15. While they're looking into why this happened,  the fact of the matter is had I not cashed out, I wouldn't have known. No warning. No showings of it anywhere in the earnings activity.  How often must this happen and it goes unnoticed?!

Edit: I'm currently on hold with Uber and nothing adds up. He has admitted that the system is saying that the adjustment isnt attached to ONE pool that I drove and he cant figure out why.

Edit: He found the adjustment. I wasn't like he originally claimed, the pool I took on Friday or even the Pool I took on Thursday (which he guessed at one point) but a Pool I took OVER A WEEK AGO. The person ""claimed"" that I didnt give them a ride. However Uber never contacted me or gave any indication that a refund happened. Had I not cashed out the rider wouldve stolen from me and Uber wouldve helped.

Drivers, again I cash out. It's really the only way (short of keeping a ledger) to keep them honest.","Or, you know, **DON’T TAKE POOLS**. I'd rather keep a ledger (or take a screen shot of your balance daily) than pay $0.50 to get my own money each time. I also do that before I cancel rides for “no-show” / return items / or if I take a toll. Then I call them up if I didn’t get correct payments. Filthy business Cashing out wont help, they just take it from future earnings. I've noticed adjustments too, it's always for like 3-4 bucks. If it happened more often than once every 2-3 months I would be mad about it, but I just leave it be for the most part. Because Uber is stealing from you, that's why They legally should have to tell you if they’re adjusting the $ you’ve earned and for what trip. They’ll be less inclined to adjust a fare if you cash out.  I cash out after every shift for this reason. Once I left it for 2days and the amount went down $7. For no reason. Yeah I woke up with -$14 one time these girls said I didn’t give them a ride I went back and forth with Uber for a month that was 7-8 months ago and I still never got it back. I’m like how did they know the gate code to the neighborhood if it wasn’t them. 👀🤷‍♀️. The girls had told me during the ride that they were prostitutes. And going to their dealers house so... they have no shame in anything they do. I cash out often for this and the possibility of a customer complaining, your account getting suspended and then you're stuck for 48 hrs. One $1 tip covers it so it's no big deal to pay the extra $0.50. Is this only happening with pool? We dont have pool here in this market thankfully."

Uber drivers keep giving me 4 stars because I don't talk,27,40.2080005325239,uber,I'm paying for a car ride. Not for a shrink. I don't want to talk. Drivers here in Latin America get extremely offended that I politely tell them I don't want to talk. This is made worse by the fact that they force you to sit at the front (due to Uber technically being illegal here and having to pretend you are a friend if the police stops you). I shouldn't be obligated to have human interaction just because I can't afford a car. I take Uber every day (it's like 2 USD a ride here) and I am so sick of having to make conversation to get a positive rating. What can I do?,"Out of all the drivers I’ve met, not a single one mentioned rating a rider less than 5 stars simply because they didn’t talk. It could be a cultural difference thing. I certainly wouldn’t do it. A quiet ride is actually easier for me because it can get exhausting to talk about the same stuff again and again. It’s worse for me because I have that stupid “great conversation” badge as my most-received compliment. A rider rated me 4 stars and used conversation as the reason once. All because I happened to be quiet for their ride. Put a jawbreaker in your mouth and offer the driver one. What's your rating So what if you have 4/5 stars, you'll still get rides.  I like that people in Latin America are more friendly.  I got an Uber back to the airport last time I was in Rio and had a great time chatting with the driver, showed me pictures of his kids even. I feel you. I'm quite uncomfortable with forced conversation, which too many Uber drivers do- "" you having a good day?"" "" You just getting out of work?"" "" What do you do?"" Ugh. I'm paying you to drive me somewhere, not paying for conversation. I can find that online for free, if and when I want it.

 I use Uber so much that I actually won't wear my work uniform until I'm at work, because Uber drivers always ask me about my job (I'm a cook). Im also in culinary school, so the last thing I want to talk about is cooking. I don't give a shit about your chicken parmesan recipe; I'm paying you to transport me to a place where I'm going to run, sweat, and labor for the next 10 hours.

BTW, couldn't Uber-drive if I wanted to- I've got a rusty 2007 Ford Taurus. So, you've gotta be either lucky/ fortunate or have awesome credit to drive Uber. So, enjoy that elite status, STFU, and drop me off at my place of employment where I literally make poverty wages.

I tip more for drivers that don't talk to me. It's the difference of $2-$7. Yeah. ""Know your role"". I think not talking st all is a bit awkward and comes across as rude... you don’t have to tell them your life story but at least just a “hi, the weathers boiling today don’t you think” or a “hows your day” isn’t going to hurt and makes their job better... It's quite simple, if they rate you bad for no good reason, do the same, wait until your rating is updated after the trip, if it goes up rate according to the trip, if it goes down 1 star, all this taking in account you did nothing wrong (not talking is not wrong). If I'm taking an Uber it means I've worked a very late shift. I start out with a joke about how tired I am and don't let me snore.

I generally tip cash too. Talk on the phone, or pretend to What you can do it take a cab. Are you sure that's it? Not because not being on time, drivers having to wait on you, not being ready at curveside when they show up, or tipping cash at end of ride? I bet it's the not being ready part...

Oh to your question.. Tip cash at end of trip. If the ride is $2US, GEEEE, what's a $1 going to hurt you.. I bet they'll be happy!"

On top of that, after that failure I had to call another ride from the same exact spot and the ride fare doubled. The ride was only a quarter mile. So for a quarter mile trip I paid something like 20 out of pocket. 

The reasoning they gave was the uber had given me several refunds (as a gold member) for the screw ups by uber eats -- not uber. I have a 4.88 ride score and have requested a refund almost never with uber except in cases like this where I simply did not get the ride. I've never requested a refund on any bad driver as I can't even remember a bad driver..

With uber eats I would frequently have missing items or delivery drivers that would drop it off at my neighbors house or down the street despite the directions. The food would be cold most of the time. I mainly complained against restaurants that would leave out a whole entree because ""they were out"" and I would be delivered sides only. 


This is absolute bullshit. I've spent nearly 300 on uber rides for 3 years now -- Nearly 7000 in ubers and I've received maybe 50 back on uber eat orders.

How do Canadians tip in comparison to Americans?  In the US most customers don’t tip, and al drivers are frustrated to not get a tip.  A $1 tip on a 3km trip would be reasonable if no traffic.  More if there’s traffic or at night. 2.75 booking fee. $0.82/km $0.11/min. +tax

Rider Stars?,36,41.06119497702629,uber,"I randomly checked, and saw I had a 4.1 star rating. I’d like to think I’m generally a fine person to be around, and I’m always trying my best to be kind and polite to others. I try to be gentle closing doors, say thank you, I never eat or drink in the car, and I’m always very quiet. Is there something I might be doing unknowingly that is leaving a bad impression on people? It’s not like it’s going to change my world if I don’t have a perfect score, but it’s something I’m definitely curious about and I don’t want to unknowingly be rude to someone.","You won't be able to keep a perfect score as some drivers will rate you low for stupid stuff. That said, 4.1 is well below average if you're a regular user of Uber. Something sounds amiss.     


Are you always ready to go when you request a ride? Time is money for a driver and my biggest pet peeve is sitting out front waiting for 5 minutes for the passenger to come out. Never use the phrase ""I'll tip you in the app"". Just do it don't say it, because the majority of people who say it don't so most drivers will rate you low for that phrase. That low of a score means you will be waiting longer then normal for a ride and you will very rarely get a experienced driver.

I would start tipping cash up front. 4.1 is a really low rating. You must be consistently doing something wrong to get that low. Many experienced drivers won’t pick up anyone below a 4.6 -4.8 . 

Either you’re a smelly smoker, too quiet and don’t smile say hello, thankyou, or always make the driver wait. The only way you’re going to get that up is to always tip in cash. Do u smoke cig right before you enter the car ? 

Does the driver wait til the timer almost 0?

Does the pick up location safe to stop? 

Is the ride less than 5 mins ? My suggestions:

1) be at the location on time.  I know it’s crummy to be ready and then open the app and find out it’s a 15 minute wait.  But, well, the drivers are trying to earn a living. And neither you nor the drivers control whether that wait is 15 minutes or one minute. So...do your best to be ready to be there within one minute when you request the ride. 

2) “hello”. “ good bye”. “Have a good day”. It sounds like you have that down. 

3). Tip every ride. In cash if you can.  In the app if you don’t have cash on you.  Uber and Lyft really don’t pay minimum wage without surges (which only Uber shares) or tips.  Many drivers lower ratings if not tipped.  Especially in Lyft (because drivers can adjust ratings a few hours later).   I don’t. But I understand drivers not wanting repeat passengers that don’t tip, given the poor compensation system.  

Number 3 makes up for a lot of other errors. Just be where the pin is, only call cars when you're outside, don't smell, let the driver use his GPS. 

People here always say tip cash, while that is the fastest way if your outright goal is a higher star rating, it's not natural and if you stop tipping cash then what, will your rating go down? Address the reason why your ratings low, it's not all money. Maybe try to treat them like it’s your friend picking u up .. no need to talk much but maybe the vibe ? I dunno ... lots of factors goes to it... and diff drivers have diff preferences Do you smoke or just generally smell bad?  That’s one of the most common reasons I’ll 1 Star someone, especially if i have to stop and febreeze the car. Start by tipping in cash, not smelling like ass, and not being silent the whole fucking trip like you are getting ready to give the driver a horrible rating."
Uber Eats Keeping Uber Stock Healthy?,1,41.08577831037067,uber,Image,"Yep it is what actually saved it from bankruptcy or ruin.  Millions of customers across the US and maybe other countries that utilize UberEats like UK and France are actually what has saved Uber.  It also allows me to eat free at least 1 time a day.  As crazy as it sounds I don't get deactivated because for every 10+ orders I deliver, there is 1 dumb person who causes a situation where I have to cancel and discard the food (into belly).  Some people will want me to come up to some high floor of Condo, but there is zero free parking and I can risk a ticket.  I give them chance to answer call or come down.  1 call and no answer? I wait 8 mins then discard into belly.  Been doing this fee years now part-time and I have 500+ deliveries and an a Diamond which is Ubers highers rewardsm.

The Rating system Reversed...,16,41.13000284741874,uber,"I’ve caught myself thinking (over many Uber rides) ‘why can I not see what rating the DRIVER gives me?’

The other side of the coin, obviously, is that we get to rate the driver, no? Cleanliness, navigation, etc all come to play when we rate their service, but why can we not see what they’ve rated us? Why can they not give us ‘compliments’ as we can give them?

FYI my rider score is a 4.9, but I’d also like to know which drivers rated me what and why.
Maybe there’s something I can do better to make my drivers experience a more pleasant one? 

I’m sure We all have questions as to ‘why’ we’re not all 5 star rated riders, since the majority of us are pleasant, say hello and thank you and pretty much take the ride in silence and let the driver do his thing, no? If there was such a thing as a way we can check out rating status, I’d like to know. Just a thought, what do you guys think?","We'd love to know why we're not perfect 5 star drivers either, especially after lifting your luggage, being on time and courteous. Anyone leaving less than 5 stars should be forced to write why, or select one of the issues

It'd also be nice if we can see exactly what riders type on complaints rather than Uber typing their own generic response ""since the majority of us are pleasant, say hello and thank you""

😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣 Drivers can’t see who rates them either, at best they can guess but since most ratings come in later it’s hard to tell. The driver however, must rate you immediately following the trip. So if you see your rating drop it was without a doubt the last ride you took. 

As far as reasons for lower ratings, the biggest issues are usually bad pickup locations, not being on your pin and ready to go, basically anything that wastes the drivers time. That’s assuming you’re polite and all that basic human decency stuff. 

And most drivers are doing 20+ trips a day and really don’t have the time or frankly care enough to type out a compliment to an individual passenger. Passengers are simply dollar signs. As drivers we can no tsee who gave us what rating because Uber fears some sort of retaliation is possible. Unless you actually report a driver for a big issue, we're left wondering too.    

We can see the notes you leave if you give us 5 stars but very few passengers bother. I haven't had a note for over a year."
Is this legal?,25,41.28928525482615,uber,Image,"Depends on state, but yes if it’s posted somewhere obvious and you expect to have no privacy. Yes Depends on the state Yep, I have 2 on my car, one on each rear passenger doors No. It's a crime against auto detailing to use scotch tape on his interior like that. In a 2 party consent state, yes.  The driver is letting you know they are recording audio of you for private use only.  It's really a CYA for them so if a passenger tries to scam later, they can prove their innocence Depending on the state yes and you have been informed. Also it's for yours and their best safety. I am a driver as well. Yes, in fact in many states it’s required by law to inform you if they’re recording. It’s legal to record in all 50 states, as far as I know. Only some require notification of passengers. Paxholes force us to do this for our safety. Informed consent, fully legal anywhere in the U.S.. Some states don't even require that. Try asking the bank of it's legal for them to record you Yup. It's a privately owned car, the driver can put whatever they want in their car. I have a dash cam and no signs.

When I was involved in a car crash, I just gave the driver a 1 star (it was his fault), wrote what happened in the comments and then I got a refund a couple days later ZzAaKr Do you think the driver should or should not get paid if your Uber is involved in a crash? Were you injured?  To what extent?  Were you seriously inconvenienced?  


For that matter, who was at fault for the accident - your driver or ""the other guy?""  


You just aren't giving us enough information to make a decision here. Hello entitled rider 2. Airlines don't do jack squat for you if your flight is canceled due to weather and you want uber to give you money back for something that by the sounds of it, was outside the drivers control.  If it was the drivers fault, I might concede, but if it wasn't, then no. Why should a passenger get a refund just for being in an accident?  Maybe a discount for an incomplete trip, but never a refund, unless driver did something stupid. Are you still alive? Aren't you getting closer? maybe you should be paying the drivers deductible for having him take you on your shitty route to begin with... if he wasn't there, he wouldn't have a damaged car, insurance premium inflations, downtime, loss of money, loss of possible house, all because you stanky ass passenger wanted to go the route with the dirt road since it's the 'fastest' and 'it's more convenient'.  fuck you and your anti drive sentiment."

Uber proposes policy that would pay drivers a minimum wage of $21 per hour,72,42.03058155114728,uber,Image,"While on a trip.... This is pretty much what drivers make as it is now in Socal at least. This $21 per promise is really no change from the current pay structure. They need to keep the drivers around until self driving cars take over. I don't think they are trying to be nice. Umm....this would make zero sense unless Uber was providing the car and gas.    

1.  Why would any driver want this??? It means you cant make more money and means you can only work for Uber and no one else.    

2. It means you cant work your own schedule.    

3.  This also mean Uber will set insane demands and constantly fire people.    

4.  Uber will also control where you will park and wait.   

$21 an hour is what a normal uber driver makes already, but now they will be subject to much more control by uber.  Uber is proposing this only because it only benefits uber. This is Uber’s way of offering next to nothing.

The minimum while on a ride means nothing. They can choose to give you more or less rides to avoid the minimum.

The injury/lost income coverage we already have if you opt in.

I would have to see the details of any paid time off to believe there is actual value there.

Regardless, I hope all attempts at forcing employment fail. $21 on a 1099 isn't much after taxes CA.  This also might have the unintended side affect of bar patrons choosing to drive rather than ride share. It sounds great but I don’t think it will happen, plus the chunk of taxes we will have to pay.. If it's Uber proposing it, then you can bet it will get ugly and bite driver. Do the math.. you would be getting paid less... if they are going to pay us an hourly  wage  make it a true hourly  wage. Not just while pax is in car For $21 an hour, I would fucking drive Uber all day.  Forget the union.  It's not going to happen. Further evidence, Uber drivers will never be happy"

Got an email from Uber about signing a California petition to keep drivers contract workers. Thoughts?,25,42.23686627338054,uber,Image,"That ""while on trip"" made me laugh hardly 😂 Fuckers are in deep shit now, and still trying to trick you in every fuckin step they seem scared. Uber is more than welcome to tell us that they think being a contract worker is superior to being an employee. In some cases, it might very well once have been. However, if they want their drivers to remain as contractors, they are going to have to provide those drivers with a good reason to do so. So far, it doesn't look like they are trying very hard. I got one from lyft as well If they just keep the rate like before they won’t have any problem They will have to pay us for wear and tare fuel and other shit. This is a good thing we seen how it goes when they control us let’s try something else It's all crap.  

Don't get me wrong,  AB5 isn't the answer either but Uber and Lyft are both trying to use scare tactics. Let’s use a little common sense here. Uber wants to pay its drivers as little as possible.  If they’re pushing something so strongly do you think it benefits them or the drivers?

Also, when is the last time they made a change that benefited the drivers instead of reducing our pay? If they're advertising it, there can be only one reason: it benefits shareholders, not drivers. Dont sign... its a way for uber to make more  money while ypu make less..let laws pass.. and im not one who normaly likes laws... 21 dollars  a hr would be good while the app is on .not just while  doing ride...just do the math. Its simple. While your passengers  are in your car have a stop watch and see how much you would get paid.."
Uber email regarding California lawmakers and contractor vs employee status,4,42.258787569687875,uber,"I received this email today from Uber and am curious about the opinions of the drivers because I was under the impression that they differ vastly than the portrayal of the email. The text of the message is:

>Stand up for drivers and ridesharing. 
Right now, lawmakers in Sacramento are debating the future of rideshare drivers in California.
>
>Today, drivers work independently and decide when, where, and how much to drive. This means reliable and affordable rides available in more places when you need them most.
>
>But some lawmakers believe drivers should be employees of the technology platforms they use—whether or not drivers actually prefer that.
>
>Forcing all drivers to become employees could drastically change the rideshare experience as you’ve come to know it, and would limit Uber’s ability to connect you with the dependable rides you've come to expect.
>
>Instead, Uber is advocating for a brand-new policy that would strengthen protections for rideshare drivers by:
Ensuring drivers would earn a minimum of approximately $21 per hour while on a trip, including the costs of their average expenses
Providing drivers access to robust new benefits, such as paid time off, sick leave, and compensation if they are injured while driving with Uber.
Empowering drivers to have a collective voice with rideshare companies, and the ability to influence decisions about their work.
Uber believes that this innovative new model will both protect drivers’ ability to work on their own terms, while maintaining the reliable rideshare experience you’ve come to depend on. But to make this possible, California needs to update the law!

How should I proceed with Uber?,3,42.30007229192113,uber,"I have been trying to set up an Uber driver partnership for the past few weeks, (due to recently being laid off) but their support is ridiculous.  Backstory: I have been a passenger for as long as they have been in my city, 4.97 rating.  I thought about driving in 2016, started to get my account set up to drive when I wanted, never finished setting up my driving account with insurance, drivers license # etc...3 weeks ago, I decide to get my drivers account set up.  I uploaded my car insurance etc.  Afterwards, I see that I had an error message stating that I am unable to drive for Uber due to a failed background check from checkr.  I don’t have any criminal issues or driving tickets from the past three years so this came as a surprise.  The support message said I could reach out to checkr and put in the details about myself and see what the issue was.  So I tried logging into their applicant portal, but they said there was no background check done on me for uber or anyone else.  I started a support ticket with checkr, and they tell me to provide checkr with my name, DOB, SSN, and the company that would’ve done the background check.  I gave them my info, and they say they can’t find any records for a background check.  Also, I never agreed to a background check in 2016 or anytime ever for Uber.  The message from Uber was pre-existing when I clicked on the “become a driver” link...So, I try to explain this to uber in their support message system and they elude to that my SSN was never uploaded to the Uber system, and if I update that, they should be able to figure something out.  So, I add my SSN under the banking info.  They then give me the same response saying I still need to update my SSN a few days later.  I reply, double check that I saved my SSN info and can’t tell wether or not that has been saved to my account.  I tell them, I added my SSN, and they gave me the same generic response I initially got stating I failed a background check and that they can’t provide me with a copy of my background check, but if I wish to see it I can login to the applicant portal on checkr’s website...so, I tried logging into checkr’s applicant portal....they still do not have a record for me and cannot find any record of a background check.  I tried to explain this to uber, and they just keep giving me ridiculous generic responses...

TLDR: Tried driving for Uber, they said I failed a background check (I don’t think there was a background check done), the company they use for background checks cannot find a background check for me in their system at any point in time.  Tried telling uber the company they use for background checks cannot find a background check for me.  Uber responds by telling me that I failed my background check and gave me same generic response they did the first time.",Go to a hub and talk to someone in person. How many accounts do you have?

Ride with an Infant,8,42.386067662302544,uber,"Has anyone traveled with a 3 month old in Uber? Are there Uber cars with car seat installed or you take your own car seat?

If you’re taking your own car seat, do you need to tell it while requesting the ride? If you’re unable to, can the driver refuse to ride with a car seat?

Also, anyone has any other tips for car share ride with an infant? I was unable to find anything. My search suggested seats are available for 12 months plus but nothing below that age. We’re in CA , if it helps.

Thanks!","You have to bring your car seat, I believe there are car seats for all ages. You have to install it. You have to understand that drivers are losing money during the wait. Some drivers may even cancel. To negate some of the negativity you may want to send a message to the driver first and prepare to tip, cash is always preferred. Bring your own car seat. Be prepared to be canceled on by drivers if you don't have one, especially for a three month-old. 

Overwhelmingly, drivers do not carry car seats as that impacts luggage space.

Do not order a shared ride if you have to use a carseat. Often times the pickup location is not ideal for installing a car seat, and other passengers might be unocomfortable with how much space is taken up by the car seat. Got it! Big tip coming our Uber drivers way. Don't use Pool, send your driver a message beforehand saying ""We have an infant and a carseat, we'll give you a $5 cash tip for the wait while we install it""

He kept asking me where I was going, so I asked him why? He kept repeating over and over what’s your address you are going? I got weirded out vibes so I hung up. Then, I waited 5 more minutes and he was still showing as parked down the street. I hailed a taxi and 5 minutes later as I was home the guy called me on my cell phone and I hung up. He was still showing as far away so I just canceled and now have a fee. Why?","Just another thief trying to steal. Get  hold of uber tell them about the guy. If you cancel after they've ""been at the pin"" for over five minutes, they get paid and you get charged. Sounds like cancel baiting. He probably got more for making you cancel than he would have for the trip. He wants your fee, LOL. Because if they cancel then they don't get your cancellation fee. If it gives me a ride extremely far away for pickup or a ride that's not worth it because let's be honest, your 2 min ride don't mean shit to the driver, I'll literally force close the app and drive lyft until they cancel. In this scenerio, the pax doesn't get charged, I don't get paid, but the pax is forced to cancel, and it doesn't affect my cancelation or acceptance rate. Ok, this is what is going on...driver wanted  to know address  of your destination  to see if it was worth it to him to do the ride...he kept you on the phone  for over two minutes because after a couple of minutes  he is going to recieved  a cancelation  fee if you cancel...here is the kicker,he will get more money for your cancellation than he would for your short ride. .. If it's just a few blocks why not walk? Or is walking extremely slow in NYC? That's the most infuriating thing ever. If they take longer than 5 minutes to get to you, they get paid your cancelation fee regardless. I've waited 10+ minutes for an Uber had them pull up and ask me to cancel in person. They then just drive away and say 'rider didn't show / refused ride ""and you still get hit with a charge. Drivers are not told how long a trip is going to be or what direction it's headed."

Can driver see destination if I schedule a day early?,6,43.402850069803776,uber,"first time uber user, i have a meeting that is probably 35 mins away from my home.

Will the driver be able to see the pickup and destination before accepting?","No 35 minutes = requesting 60 minutes before start of meeting!!!!!! Don’t be late! And don’t blame uber. The driver will see that it's a scheduled ride, but otherwise it will be the same as normal.  They get a ping telling him/her how far away the passenger is from the driver's current location, and now, with Uber Pro Gold and above, I assume it'll tell the driver how long the ride is.  Uber doesn't notify drivers until it's time to proceed to the scheduled pickup.  Incidentally, if you live in an area that's isolated to the point that no drivers are nearby and accept the ride request, Uber will let you know that the request can't be fulfilled.  That happened to somebody on one of these forums recently.  It wouldn't happen in my area. No. No. However a 30 minute ride is a decent fare for the driver and he is unlikely to cancel. However if you want to be sure to avoid a last minute cancellation call the driver while he is on the way and let him know where you’re headed."

I believe I left keys in a car but the driver won’t respond at all - even to say no they don’t have the keys - any recourse?,6,43.46709775499724,uber,"I had a bad uber ride where the driver started driving away before we were even out of the vehicle (so, it was a low rated poor ride). After dinner I realized my keys were missing. While there is a chance they fell in the street, my inkling is that they were in the car. I tried calling through Uber’s service but first it routed me to someone who said they didn’t work for uber (and that I woke her up) so I’ve only been going through uber support. They cannot get ahold of the driver at all, to say yes or no. Am I just screwed here? Support only gives me canned comments.","Even if they had your keys, sounds like no way the driver is gonna come out to bring them to you without getting cash to do it.

Moral of the story, keep track of your stuff Message Uber, get drivers number. Call, text and leave him a voicemail. We don't know his hours, if he works day or night, his schedule or if he has another job. Offer him a cash tip of $40-60. Give hin 24 hours to get back to you. If no response change your locks and take the loss. 

A lot of times passengers start calling us but don't realize we too have a life, it's okay if we don't answer your first call. It is extremely inconvenient to return an item especially if you're more than 15 minutes away from our area. Our time is directly related to money. Again offer him a tip, the $15 return fee really doesn't cover anything. 

While your ride didn't go well for many reasons, at this point you just want your keys back. Fess up. What did you do to the driver? He knew that he would get a one-star. What do you expect?

If I were the driver, I may think about it when you leave me a message or text apologizing and offer me $100 for my time lost to return your keys. You will put the money in a magnetic pouch and stick to a UPS street box on an intersection and then leave. If the money checks out, I'll mail you the keys so I know where you live. 1 star"
Why do some Uber drivers set their account to say they are deaf and then you get in their car and they can clearly hear you and respond back to what you say?,15,43.4722019216639,uber,,"Probably want to avoid conversation. Deaf isn't absolute... there are levels of hearing impairment. I am partially deaf in my right ear, was getting low ratings for ignoring people. 

Though it appears I hear fine there are times I do not. They don't wanna talk to you bud... Ive been considering setting mine to that because I do have a hearing impairment, but I am not actually deaf. 

I wish it had different options to indicate 'hearing impaired or 'deaf'. So customer would text instead of calling for direction etc So you don't call them. Sometimes women in the backseat whisper at me, then their feelings get hurt if I can't hear them. Why are you trying to talk to deaf drivers?"

I've had this happen 3-4 times this week alone but if I do this to the driver I'm charged $5 each time.","As a driver, I agree that drivers shouldn't accept pings from inside their home where they have to go out and start the car before they get underway.  I won't go online unless my car is running, phone synced to bluetooth, music is playing, temperature is between 70 and 72 degrees, etc.  Fortunately I don't spend a lot of time idling in my market. You order cheap rides expect cheap service, junior. You probably dont tip either.  🙄

Stop being cheap and order up to UberBlack Sounds like you're expecting professional services at amateur prices.  You should probably lower your expectations, or pay for the level of service you require/expect.  Complaints like this remind me of people bitching about the quality of McDonald's.  You paid $5 for a meal, dude.  It's not gonna be awesome. Why? If the driver doesn't move in 2 minutes, you can cancel before that. You can also cancel when the driver doesn't arrive at the ETA. The driver may be doing #2 so you can do him a favor by canceling. Yeah, no. I will walk around a store or waot in my apartment of I want. I will not sit in my car engine running and wasting valuble fuel just because some self entitled asshole thinks he deserves to be treated better them he is.

Texting while sitting in highway traffic,42,44.1284403476257,uber,"My driver was texting while we sat in traffic this morning. I was aggravated about this but otherwise the ride was fine and I got home safe. I feel bad reporting it but I don’t want to encourage texting and driving even if sitting in bumper to bumper traffic. Thoughts?

Edit: The driver was holding the phone in his hand, it was not mounted while he was texting.","Bottom line: it's against Uber's rules.  I don't care who says ""but it was bumper-to-bumper"" or ""I can text and keep an eye on traffic.""  
IT. IS. AGAINST. UBER'S. RULES. FOR . DRIVERS.  Even if legal in your state - Uber's rules are stricter than the law, to make sure passengers feel safe.  After all, the driver's are there for the safety and comfort of their passengers, despite some drivers (including some on this thread) feeling it's the other way around.  


You were perfectly right to report it. I am disgusted with all the Uber drivers justifying texting and driving. I was injured permanently from someone texting and driving, now need meds to function with a somewhat normal life. It would make me very uncomfortable as a passenger, especially considering another accident could trigger my condition to worsen to the point of paralyzation or death. It’s not a joke you are responsible for the lives of others when you are driving and especially with a passenger. Needs to be reported. 100%. If you don’t report and he kills someone texting and driving tomorrow, that’s on you. I feel like it’s not a big deal if it’s bumper to bumper traffic If it really was bumper to bumper so he used his phone while he was stopped then what is the big deal??  

Why are you so concerned?? was his phone hands free because if it was hes doing nothing illegal.

 You are potentially going to ruin his life over something as trivial as that If it's bumper to bumper traffic, he couldn't have been able to hurt you no matter what. The law is about safety. There is no safety issue here. At worst he might scratch his bumper but it's his matter. Did he brake hard often making you uncomfortable? I don't think so. I would get VERY upset as a driver if someone gets me for this, my car can move on it's OWN when we are sitting on traffic, and keeps a safe distance, but I don't necessarily tell the rider about it, but if there is a stop/go traffic, I set it up, and grab my phone... ignorance from a rider of such technology, shouldn't cause me (a driver) to lower my rating! Stop it. You're either being a troll or a pussy. Either way, stop it. You were in traffic, get over it Was he moving while he was holding his phone? If not, then let it go."

thanks in advance!","If he's comfortable jamming that cast in the foot well, sure.  And I'm assuming he drives an automatic?  Uber doesn't care if you're in a cast, as long as you have a working car and you look like your profile picture Others are saying that there's no obligation to help with luggage, but I jump out of the car every time I hit the trunk release.  I'll load/unload every bag that the passengers will let me so as to not end up with scratches on the back of the car. Yes, easily. Be sure to for him to add to his profile that he is unable to help with luggage and should be good Yep...they will be glad to allow  him to allow them to steal some of his hard earned  money You’ll get better advice in /r/uberdrivers

Driver wouldn’t open up the door until I told him who I was...err what?,35,44.36357923653942,uber,"So I was coming out of work and it was about 5PM local time.

I see my driver there and I match the license plate to what shows on Uber.

So I tired to open the door, nothing. Two more times..nothing.

So the street is busy so I can hear the driver yelling something, but I just can’t make it out.

I go to the open windows and it says “What’s your name?”

I guess he could have had issue with the wrong person getting in his vehicle.

Idk thoughts? It kinda made me upset, but I didn’t rate him based on that, so after that it was a good ride(other then him having his phone in his lap and keep looking down where he was going and not on a phone stand)","You don’t understand how many times someone sees the lyft or Uber sticker and feels entitled enough to just hop in. I’ve had people do that when I have both apps off when I’m just sitting in my car eating and taking a break. Locking the door isn’t rude. The rider should tell the driver their name immediately.

Then the driver can be confident that they have the correct passenger.

 Any passenger that does not understand this is being unreasonable. Your overbearing sense of entitlement is hilarious

Drivers Job: make sure he has the correct passenger

Customers Job: identify themselves

If you don't understand that, then you are going to have this problem forever and trust me, it's most definitely your problem https://youtu.be/DgMNn94X0eU

This guy got mugged because he let someone in his car without verifying their identity. well, that was one of his two mistakes anyway.

Identity verification is two ways. you need to verify the driver's identity, they also need to verify yours.

If you won't play, then yeah I ain't unlocking my doors. Well, you won't see me with rideshare stickers anymore anyway.

Now, assault with a gun isn't exactly the most common negative outcome of this kind of carelessness, but as a driver you will eventually have somebody try to impersonate your passenger and steal a ride. Or some drunk moron get in and refused to get out.

It's not a question of, does stuff like this really happen? It's more like, how many times will it happen to you. If you're experienced it's happened. Sounds like he was a bit rude about it, but this is pretty standard procedure. It is always sommother and less confusing when we exchange names right off the bat and everyone seems to feel safer.  I have always just showed up and said ""Ride for X?"" and then usually they reply with my name and we're off."
Why am I getting receipts from May this morning?,1,44.4580121069098,uber,,"Same thing, both from Uber & Uber Eats.... just tried to login to my account online but it’s disabled. Hmmm..."
Thinking about taking a long Uber,29,44.5671324772912,uber,I’m basically wanting to use Uber on a return trip that is about 1 hour and 45 minutes. When I pull it up on the app is does everything normally and ask me to confirm. Has anyone taken a longer Uber and would any Uber driver actually accept the fare ? Thanks for your time.,"The uber driver will get a notification saying the trip is over 45 minutes before accepting it.  Some drivers like these kinds of trips.  So, some will accept. Some won't.

Keep in mind - your driver gets paid by the minute & mile while on the trip with you.   He or she gets no pay at all, while driving back to their home area, unless they happen to get a ride going back that way, which is not likely.

So, to be fair, it would be good for you to compensate them with a tip that pays for that 2 hours of time & however many miles of gas to get back to where they started.   Think $15/hour plus about 3 or 4 gallons of gas.  On top of what you would have tipped them for the trip alone.

If you want to make sure the driver accepts your ride, and if you want to treat the driver with respect as someone doing a service for you, go ahead & text this info to them right when you get connected, so he/she can make an informed decision - something like ""Hi, this is your uber passenger.  My destination is <destination>.  I realize that takes you out of your area, so I wanted to let you know in advance & wanted to assure you that I would be tipping you $60 for your time""

&#x200B;

But, yes, some drivers absolutely love trips like that Why not just rent a car? You can usually rent a car for a week for like $100, which is probably less than the Uber. Have done it with an Uber XL and didn't had any problems at all, but when the driver picked me I instantly call her telling her about it, she agreed and that was it As stated by others, some drivers actually prefer [long trips](https://imgur.com/a/ubyAEYC). If a driver cares he'll call you in advance to confirm destination. If the driver is a newb and doesnt want the trip he may be too scared to confront you about it so be prepared for a negative attitude. If you compensate him fairly for it then he'll probably be happy to do it. Otherwise just order the trip and let whatever happens happen. the driver might actually take the ride since it will be deemed “worth it”

you’re one of the lucky few at this point I have taken one a little over an hour out. As a courtesy I always call ahead as soon as I make the request to make sure the driver is Ok with the driving  distance(just in case they weren’t paying attention while accepting). And then I tip them at least 25%+ if the ride was good/great. 

The tipping amount is of course, more of personal preference but I would would definitely try to give them a notice and some tip. Tip well.. he has to drive home for free and uber dont care.....have driver show you how much they made for the ride. Just take multiple Ubers along the way so one driver doesn't have to make the entire trip."

He finally dropped me off and then later when I checked my email, it said that it cost me $37 for the trip...WTF was my first reaction....the breakdown given in the email was $14(Distance) + $20(Time) + $3(Sales tax)...I was surprised by this as I have never really saw something like this before.

The driver didn't violate any TOS so he will be paid. And that mule will be much more valuable to Uber than you. Uber may be relatively new but think about the oldest professionals and their clients. You are absolutely disposable. You are nothing, my esteemed rider.

Uber could have given you the refund but that would be too easy and how are we get paid doing nothing? Uber makes sure that you have to scream and squirm at least 3 times to get anything. And while you are screaming and squirming we change our hats from support team to priority team to top-priority team.

Our job is just as stressful as you are screaming and squirming, my dear esteemed rider. But that's how we get paid. Our consolation is that your meds and therapists are much more expensive than our generics and gurus.

Have a nice life and don't come back. You got to where you got to go why do you think you should get a refund? 

For once uber does the right thing all I see is another entitled rider That's Uber support 101. As a driver we sometimes have pickups during busy events such as concerts or airport pickups that say 1 mile or 7 minutes away and ends up being dead traffic 30-45 minutes. In these situations we're unpaid, Uber refuses to pay us our minute wait rate; they say it took longer than their pickup estimate. 

If something goes wrong with Uber good luck to the driver and the passenger, support gets nothing done. You are paying a fee less than taxi .. most uber drivers are normal regular working people with other jobs , you could be an Uber driver too 

Now with all that aside ,Uber and lyft per mile rate are now at all time low , around $.50 cents 

For that huge amount of $ the driver should be able to wear pajama , and not maintain his/her car and give shitty service especially to op There’s something fishy about OPs story. If the drivers phone was dead and the pickup didn’t register how did the trip get properly logged? 

There is no way the OP could have been charged for the trip if the phone was dead. Anyway he got to his destination and so Uber charged him for service rendered and refused to refund because cheap ass OP was obviously lying to get a free ride. OP, you suck. As a person - you suck. As a human being - you suck. I can see a refund for the service fees on the second ride, because you are right, you should have been able to add a new destination.  Unfortunately you didn’t specifically ask for that in the first two messages. Uber support needs to see the request in painstakingly explicit detail or you get a canned no reply. 

1 star the first driver by the way, that guy sucks."
Check Uber Hotspot Times?,2,45.41831303289367,uber,Is there anyway to check like a log of how many Uber drivers are active on average in my area at a given time? I'm headed to the airport early tomorrow and I'm not sure if the area I'm in would be that busy at that time.,"Nope. Best you can do is pretend to order a ride at that hour the day before to get a glimpse of how many drivers are in your area. Use the ""scheduled ride"" function (little clock in the corner). It tags the request as ""scheduled"" which drivers place a little more importance on since it's almost always used for airport runs. Keep in mind this does not actually schedule a ride with a driver, it goes out like a regular request to the closest at that time, it just sends the request a little earlier than when you make it. Order a ride, make sure you give yourself plenty of time to be picked up."

Is this some new uber policy?    

I had just gotten off a 15-hour TPAC flight and was dead tired... so I ended up falling asleep anyway...  

then he stopped the car and tried to wake me up again.  :(","Passengers sleep in my car all the time when I work nights. That driver's an idiot. It’s not an Uber rule, but it is sometimes hard on a driver. 

Here are problems that come up.

1) am I going the wrong way? When a pax falls asleep, sometimes they wake up and get all pissed off we went route A, they want Route B. It’s a pain to deal with. But ehhh oh well. 

2) sleeping drunks sometimes puke themselves. 

3) medical issues happen and you don’t know if the dude is dead or passed out. 

4) Getting a sleeping person to wake up is sometimes hard. I’ve had to try to wake dudes up who don’t even wake up for a hard brake check. 

That said, if someone wants to sleep in my car, I’m all for if. I don’t want backseat driving, I don’t think someone who can fall asleep is going to be able to bitch about feeling unsafe while the camera shows they slept like a baby. And it’s kinda a complement that someone feels safe enough with my driving they nod off. I don’t like touching sleeping or drunk passengers, neither does my husband. People nowadays can claim sexual crimes against you even if you just touch their damn shoulders. I get that you were tired, sometimes my riders take naps but I warn then ahead that if they are still asleep at their destination, I cannot touch them to wake them up so they need to be responsible for that. Sometimes they’ll set an alarm on their phones by the time I get there, but sleeping passengers are so rare I don’t worry about them much. I’ve only had one drunkard before who didn’t wake up and I had to get the wife up from her sleep to come get him out. No.  One star and move on with life. He is being a dick ! 1 Star him There's no policy on this, other than the driver might think you're passing out due to being drunk rather than a long day. Waking up a drunk passenger can be a pain in the ass. I had a sober guy falling asleep once that kept snoring with his mouth open, it was so fucking obnoxious that I kept brake checking him to jolt him back awake. I've had plenty of peeps fall asleep, no big deal. It was handy on one really long drive when I had to pee in a bottle. His car = his rules. If you fall asleep, the driver has to call the police. Do you want that? Uber policy prohibits touching the rider.

What I do is to find an opening to do a little braking. I will throw you down on the floor and it works every time unless you are unconscious. Though I have no idea how much Uber paid out for broken things. You are fully covered though."
Can I use a Deuce and a Half as an Uber?,11,45.6028732180899,uber,"I've got a Deuce and a Half and it's got benches in the bed of the truck to carry troops and shit. Uber passengers can go on the bench.

Is this allowed? I can carry like 8-16 people at once.","You will never make money, even  making your own biodiesel using a multifuel model. Plus, most deuces wont be within the years needed and alot of them get antique plates and a yearly mileage cap. You'd probably get a pile of complaints both legitimate and another pile of not all that legitimate ones too lol I considered it during the winters where I am from but even then you wont ever even come close to breaking even let alone making anything at all. If you're in a party town I'd go on as a party bus and not uber. Youd never come out on top. Try thumbtack. I would allow it.  Dunno for uber or lyft but that seems like a kick ass party bus kind of night. You can use a car as long it have 4 seatbelt and 4 seats for passengers, also have Ac and power window

For list of cars you should check out uber driver app No. You can't even use a 4 door pickup. The party bus idea works. Busses are banned, Max seating limit is 8 on Uber and Lyft. Has to have 4 doors. 

No one wants to ride in a troop transport. There’s a reason Humvees would get packed 5 deep with NCOs while trucks were filled with privates I've seen lists of Uber accepted vehicles that allowed half-ton crew-cab pickups but had specific language saying that ""heavy duty"" trucks are not allowed.  Incidentally, how many gallons per mile does that thing get?"
"I have a 4.96 star rating, my customer told me I'm labeled as ""top driver"" even though he had ridden in 5 star cars in the same area. Not complaining or anything but what's the deal?",13,45.63376442179359,uber,,"No one stays a 5.0 for long. One asshat who “cant rate anyone 5stars because no one’s perfect” fucks that up.

He's asking about the **Top Driver** designation, not so much the nuances of the number rating system. I'm interested too! 5 star cars don't have many reviews A top driver, not the top driver... New drivers don't get the tag. My passengers tell me I am a Top Driver everyday and that is good enough for me!! lol I was 5 star for about 2 weeks , then a pax saying wow you have 5 star rating , that is very rare , then he gave me a 4 star rating since my car have finger smudge on the pax window Get on your knees and beg for that fucking five stars! Meanwhile Uber financially rapes you in silicone valley and has a 2 star google rating LOL. Uber is probably teabagging you right now. I have a perfect rating on Lyft but my Uber is 4.82 because I get a lot more entitled paxholes and Uber's rating system is so skewed towards passengers that I might as well be giving blowjobs for a perfect rating."

"When a driver reports a passenger, does Uber immediately closes the user account or it takes a while?",10,46.13648432922309,uber,"Hi, I have a question.

As I said in the title, how does the process work and how long it takes Uber to take action? 

Context:

A friend said that she was molested by a driver in the way home and then was able to escape, she couldn’t report the driver because the driver reported her first and now she can no longer access the driver information and report him. 

Thanks!","If her account is still valid she can contact Uber and make the report. However, if she was drunk when she got the ride and did something she either doesn’t remember or regrets then it would be an asshole thing to report an innocent driver.  Just unpair in the future so she doesn’t get matched with him again. 

Uber will contact the account holder in a few days to get their side. If she did something  wrong she can just deny it and they’ll put her back on."
My mom got charged for a returned item.,5,46.219227384778634,uber,"The problem is that she never lost an item, and the driver definitely didn’t return anything.

I responded to the email about the charge and also sent a complaint through the app. Should I do anything else?","Driver cant collect a lost item fee without you confirming something was lost through the app. There should be an email. There should be a picture of the item. Did you leave trash in the car? That is an easier way to collect a trash fee since they have made it hard to collect a number of those fees now. Did your mom leave any trash in the car? Yeah it was not a returned item fee. The driver reports a lost item, with mandatory pictures. That generates a ticket, Uber contacts the rider to confirm the item belongs to them. At that point Uber provides contact details so that you can arrange the return, and only then can the driver collect a returned item fee. So she got an email saying that they refunded it. The initial email said that the driver reported a lost item, etc. No idea what trash they would’ve dropped"

Converting uberEATS to regular uber?,4,46.40914636628495,uber,"Hello all, 

I signed up for uberEATS a month ago and enjoy it, and am interested in taking regular passenger fares. I contacted Uber support who told me I'd have to make a whole new account(?) to be able to do this, and I cannot find any support articles or answers on google about how I can do this. Note I cannot make a new account because I don't have two seperate phone numbers, lol. 

Thanks for the help!","That's weird. I used to take both Uber and ubereats on the same account. I stopped doing eats rides and they eventually took it off but before I never had a problem You will have to make a whole new account. I needed to do the same thing. You can add Eats to a pax acct, but you cannot add pax to an Eats only account. 

Best thing to do is go to a hub. They will get you a new account that can do pax. They basically end up having to delete your Eats only account to create it and you “start over”. You do NOT need to create a new account, your existing account can be upgraded. Source: I just went through this process a month ago: https://i.imgur.com/ep7NEFW.jpg

If you called support they have zero idea what they're doing, and even if they did phone support doesn't have the ability to start the process anyway. You'll need to open a support ticket through your app."

Yeah this is crazy.... but hey America 🤷🏻‍♂️😂 Nah I have an anime sticker where it would be.

As a driver have you ever had a passenger come onto you?,23,46.54872969962933,uber,"And it not be a scam of some sort?

I'm (f, Hispanic) a frequent uber passenger and most of the drivers I encounter are cool, chill people who get me to my destination in a safe and timely manner, but the thought never crosses my mind lol however last week I had a driver who looked to be in my age range and was super cute and I was feeling some type of way in the backseat. On that drive the thought of hooking up with my driver did totally cross my mind for a few moments but I was way to shy to like say anything or whatever.

Anyway, drivers have you ever had a genuine Moment with a passenger?

(ps - if it had happened I wouldn't have tried to ge t out of paying or anything, I would strictly be doing the driver for the fun of it)","Pass them your number before you leave if you think there's something there. Don't expect the driver to reciprocate in the vehicle as that is unprofessional. I've had 2 or 3 flirt but it didn't go further.  I run campus and bars late night.  Some of these college girls are beyond cute, so the attention is nice but nothing's happened. I didn't act on anything. Honestly if you were cute enough I'd probably allow it to happen, or at least get your number for future fun. I (male) was dropping a trio off at a gay bar once and the guy in the front seat was extremely forward. I told him I had been happily married for the last 14 years and wasn’t interested. Told my wife about it later and she laughed pretty hard. If you’re going to hit on someone you just met, develop the conversation quickly and you’ll be able to tell if they’re into it or not. I went in for drinks a couple of times but it was obvious they were just super drunk and  coming on to any guy. Now I wouldnt even bother if the opportunity arises again. Just do it. Guys like it when women hit on them. I’m a guy and I’ve had flirty passengers. Both male and female. I laugh it off. 
I’m flattered but also married. 
I did have one passenger though who was a driver too. He told me he had hooked up with a few. He told me to make sure that the passenger trades personal numbers instead of using the app just to avoid getting in trouble. He was also the driver that told me to save receipts for cell phone bills. Yes but I rejected them all the time. It was usually gross ass men who wanted some ass and thought I would offer up to which I said no and kicked them out and called Uber and told them what happened. If you were the driver and someone came onto you, how would you feel?  Lets remove the fact that they are attractive or not.  Im sure if they weren't your type, it could create some uncomfortness very easily. Yeah I've had drivers around my age express their interest but it was never anything put of line or unprofessional. And there was never any disrespect either. Yes but her husband was there, and calmed her drunk down. I've had a couple of drunken cougars (sorry if you don't like that term, but that's the best way to describe them) and a few inebriated overly affectionate 20-somethings make the openings of a pass. I usually shut them down (gently) by talking about my wife and kids. Yeah, passenger hook-ups happen all the time, just not the type your looking for.

Uber Pass Price Protection: false advertising?,4,47.25773432930586,uber,"I bought a ride pass for Los Angeles, which claims price protection to prevent surge pricing. I have noticed however, several instances where the price still changed during busy hours, and frequently the ride discount was only a few cents to round the price down to a 50 cent interval. I've taken a lot of screencaps to document the issue, and I can see that the ride pass is applied and all within the service area. 

Is the ride pass being buggy or are the benefits of the pass falsely advertised?","Welcome to uber. Manipulation master. The ride pass used to be $4.99 pool/8.99 X anywhere in LA county (25/30 max fare). Then they changed it to 15% discount. It has since devolved into a $25 subscription to nothing at all and become widely available. In my opinion, there’s no compelling reason to buy the ride pass, even if you ride in Uber every day, unless you’re spending at least $700/month on rides or need to transit the 405 pass via Uber every day. 

There’s no guarantees for what the price will be at all. There’s no guarantee that the surge pricing will not affect your ride quote. There’s no guarantee of any set discount. They just say it will get to you a better price. And it does, by 0.50 or so. You have to take a minimum of 50 rides at the minimum discount to even pay for this horrible pass. 

It’s a terrible deal. Idk why people buy it. If Uber is busy check lyft or if they’re both surging outside like a big event then hop on a bus towards where you’re going and then grab a ride from closer to the destination. contact the ftc and the AG in your state. This just happened to me today.

Keep being a human, my friend. A moment of airheadedness is probably a welcome respite from some of the passenger horror stories I've read on this sub. Don't be embarrassed! You should tip your driver for killing some of his/her brain cells after that stupid statement! Its the least you can do lol If I said that I'll certainly get 1-star and ""service not as expected"" feedback.

I was about the only driver in the area. I got a request before I dropped off the current passenger. The girl was going to a large apartment complex without a number. So I ended the ride to encourage her not to get out before we circled around to find the apartment that she could recognize.

I forgot about the waiting rider. When I got there it was a sports bar I didn't know existed in the same plaza where I wash my car. A large but glamourous woman in a low cut dress came to my rolled-up window.  Her head and boobs got into my window. She was the bartender. She told me very courteously that her patron was coming in a moment and asked me to take care of her precious cargo. 

I didn't realize at the time but the rider must have been furious about the wait without looking at the details in the app.  The bartender was trying to defuse the situation.

It was an uneventful ride but near the end, I was looking over my shoulders a couple of times to try to get to the left lane. He didn't seem to register that and asked me to change to the left lane. I said in a plain voice, ""I'm trying to."". And I got 1-stared and all the ""feedback"" I got before him and then some. You mean college right? Haha if I was in a uber that would give me a chuckle... dont worry maybe you didnt embarrass yourself to the driver they probably thought it was amusing + Does the younger generation not know how to use periods?"
Uber customer ratings,24,47.68451673674638,uber,Uber has us rate their drivers on a five-star system. Uber also rates there passengers on a five-star system.

I think that there needs to be a change to the system and we should be rated simply on how we pay.,"First off almost no one is a “5-star” passenger unless it’s a new account. Your “payment” has nothing to do with your rating and tipping likely doesn’t either. Drivers (not Uber) rate you immediately following the ride and most tips come through after that. Your rating is almost entirely based on your behavior during trips. Unless your rating is below 4.7 I wouldn’t worry about it. U spend $1000 uber? Why not drive ur self? Since you are strapped on cash Drivers have to rate you before they can move on to the next trip, and before they know if you tipped unless you tipped before the trip ends. Any driver who rated you less than 5 stars will pull down your average, rounded to 2 decimal places. i dont rate people based on anything but how much of an asshole i think they are. have you considered trying your hardest to be less assholish? Tips are most likely the factor in your passenger rating.  Uber surcharges drivers 20% - 40% per ride.  Is there a reason why you wouldn't tip a driver who provided an excellent or great rider experience?  


""Most Uber and Lyft passengers have no idea how much of their fare goes to their drivers, but after a ride is finished, their drivers can see exactly how much — or little — of the fare they keep. That helps explain why Uber drivers took to the street this week in advance of Uber’s blockbuster public offering Friday.

The companies’ take is not a fixed percentage of the fare. They charge passengers an up-front fare based on the trip’s estimated length and duration, plus any surge pricing that may be in effect, minus any promotional discounts. Unlike taxi fares, which are regulated and pretty transparent, Uber and Lyft can charge riders whatever they think the market will bear at any place and moment in time.

If you include both fees, Uber’s share of the fare averaged almost 30%, according to an unscientific sample of two dozen trip breakdowns I got from five Bay Area Uber drivers this week. (I excluded tolls, airport fees and tips from the calculation.) One was negative, which means Uber lost money on the ride. The rest ranged from 19% to 45%. Driver Jin Lan said he’s seen Uber or Lyft take as much as 60% of the fare.

That’s higher than what the two firms reported in their prospectuses. Uber said its ride-hailing “take rate,” a complicated formula that essentially reflects its share of passenger fares, was 21% last year, “varying from 12% to 24% by region.” Lyft said its take rate, which it calls “revenue as a percentage of bookings,” was 26.8% last year, but that included revenues from things like electric scooters and bike rentals, in addition to car trips."" ""why is my rating low??""

Acts like a complete buffoon in the comment section to show us why 9 tips are earned they are not required. And if I think your car is dirty or you seem to be a unhygienic person or you don't have good conversation then I don't tip you there's no law requiring me to tip you you have to earn it and I'm already paying $23 for a fucking ride so why the fuck should I tip you and spend almost 30 on a $22 ride? Answer that fucking question. If you don't like the pay rate of the job go get another fucking job just like I did so I can afford to pay for my ride."

"Problem with ""verbal altercation""",11,48.39783849604152,uber,"Good day y'all

I wanted to ask if it's possible to dispute a ""verbal altercation"" (translated from spanish) repot from uber. I got an email during my second uber trip of the day telling me that during ""my trip"" (no specification) an altercation was reported. No offences or verbal disputes will be tolerated against partners or other users. It also said that uber hopes I understand that if I am a repeat offender, they may permanently ban my account.

Now, that last part scared the hell out of me. Uber is my main mode of transport and I've been using it ever since it arrived in my city several years ago. It's how I used to get to high school, and it's how I get to college now. Never have I ever had issues with drivers other than double charges and such. I can tell you how okay of a rider I am, but that's irrelevant and would also look as if I thought I was in the right here.

I'd like to know:  
a) how long does it take for such reports to reach me? I have sent ubers to my friends in the past (most recent was two weeks ago) and they were probably drunk. If so, I'd understand the report.  
b) is it very serious? am I really at risk of losing my uber account?  
c) how efficient is uber's customer support? the message had the name of the sender below it, and it wasn't the name of any uber driver which has picked me up in the last few days. 

idk guys i'm really scared, already changed my password and told my friends to not ask me for ubers anymore.

thanks for reading!","This is almost certainly one of your drunk friends whom you were allowing to use your account without you being present. It sucks, but you are indeed responsible for the conduct of all persons who get in the Uber you summoned on your account. One to two weeks sounds about right for Uber to investigate and send you this message.

To avoid being a repeat offender, you took the right step to not share your Uber account anymore. Hopefully it didn't already happen twice. And yes, you will really be banned from Uber for two or more verbal altercations with Uber drivers.

Also, if you have been sharing your account your Uber rating may already be so low right now that you are having to wait through a few declines before a driver will accept your request. Many drivers won't pick up someone who has received low ratings. Don’t let anyone use your account. Your so called friends don’t give a shit if you get in trouble. Yes they will ban you if reports come in a lot. I’ve take. A 4.45 rating pax and it still fine..

Never ordered uber for ur friend , they are adult and should order themselves.. there’s a reason why some people donot have uber /lyft account , usually because they got banned It's possible that a driver reported your friend. If you think they were drunk, then they were likely drunk. I stopped requesting rides for my friends a long time ago. My rating kept dropping, I rarely got paid back for the ride and it's usually after a night out. $1 cash tip each ride,and your rating will hop right back up. It's a small token gesture,but makes yo uh almost always a quick 5 star rating from driver"

Shot dead and no tips is a real bad night. Uber gave you bad advice. This is one if the reasons taxis got a bad name.

Keeping Platinum?,5,49.29783849606636,uber,"I've earned Platinum sometimes this summer. I was 1,500 points away from Diamond, but that had to be done by August 15. My meter has since reset, and now reads: 

Platinum through Feb 15, 2020

Unlock Diamond by Feb 15.

What do I need to do to just keep Platinum? Earn 2,500 points before Feb 15? Will this extend my Platinum by another 6 months?

  
Thank you.","Yeah, six months seems to be about the right timeframe.  That's a pretty high point total, honestly. Yes.

If you earn 2,500 points in this period (Aug '19 to Feb '20) you will be extended platinum status for Feb '20 to Aug '20.

If you earn less than 2,500 points during Aug '19 to Feb '20, your platinum status will end in Feb '20. All good but the timeline. 

You are working to keep your rating to the end of the next 3 month quarter. 

For example Jan - March you make 1,500 points, (I don’t know what your points levels are so bare with me), and you qualify for platinum. If you got 1,500 more points or 3,000 points you are diamond. That level sticks with you till the end of the next three months. But your points reset in April. 

So April rolls around, you are still platinum, but you now have 0 points. It’s April-July period, and you get 1500 ride points in June, you are still platinum, but you earned platinum till the end of Aug-Oct. if in July you got 1,500 more, for 3,000 total in April-July, you would turn diamond as soon as you reached 3,000, then keep it till the end of Oct. 

Now Aug rolls around and you are diamond, the points go back to 0, but you stay what you were the last day of last quarter. If you make 1,500 this month, you will start next month off as a platinum, if you get 3,000, you’ll be diamond. 

Does that make sense?"

Can I still get a refund? or file a complaint against him?","Always confirm your pick up location in the app so that the driver goes to where you actually are. If the driver is told to go to the wrong place it shouldn’t be their fault. The driver should be compensated with the cancellation fee for wasting their time. Maybe you should walk next time. Most likely you messed up your own pickup location. Go to where the pin is, or put the pin where you are. 

As far as a refund: were you charged a cancellation fee? You may be able to get that refunded. But you won’t get a refund for the successful ride you took. 

Filing a complaint: fuck you. Shit happens. If you want a more reliable transportation service, hire a towncar. You opted for a dirt cheap ride from some random non-professional driver in their personal car. If that made you late, that’s on you, you cheap fuck. Were you exactly at the pickup point gps you put in the app? And not the default? 
Were the point of pickup in the middle of the building ? Building have 4 corners and usually multiple entrance .
Only place uber when you are ready togo and not a couple mins inside the building Of course/ you don’t pay if they don’t pick you up 

Just complain on the app via support."

Crash happens halfway through Uber ride and refund is refused,53,49.41290794055771,uber,"I was taking an UberX ride today and, halfway through the ride, my car was rear-ended. Because I was looking down at my phone when it happened, I could not be certain as to fault. After the accident, the driver cancelled the ride. It strikes me as incredible that Uber is not refunding the $5.80 I paid for the ride -- I currently have a promotion -- and would instead risk the ire of a passenger who experienced a crash. Moreover, it's not like I was able to walk away from the crash at my destination -- the driver's car was damaged, the ride was cancelled, and I was left halfway from my intended destination.","I was in an Uber that was in an accident.  The driver ended the ride on the app, which was correct.

Uber was calling me within 24 hours to see if I was ok and refunded the ride in full without me even asking because of the accident.  They also followed up about a week later to see if I was still ok AND the insurance company called me to see if my version of the accident matched the drivers.

If Uber doesn't contact you within the next day, submit an ""I was in an accident"" (it's an option) and watch how fast they contact you.  

From their website:  Head to Trip and Fare Review > I was involved in an accident. Next, please let us know what happened. Check that you have selected the correct trip and share all available info here. A member of our team will reach out to confirm everyone's safety and gather any other required information. If the car you were in was rear-ended, it's impossible for it to be your driver's fault

You should, however, be refunded for an incomplete journey You'd rather he let it run up the meter and you be stuck there waiting on the police to record the accident and then whatever fall out may happen after that probably still ending with you taking a different ride the rest of the trip? You're starting to see how little Uber cares for any of us. You won't get a refund and Uber won't even give a penny to fix the drivers car. Sorry this happened to you :( Thank God you are okay though! 
Uber should really compensate you. To the people who are saying you should just pay it, they’re not realizing that it’s more the principal than the money. 
You paid to get from a to b and you never got to b, therefor you never got what you paid for. If you’re tight on money and the 5 bucks means a lot, you could always dispute it with your credit card company. 
Uber has become so heartless lately. You were put into a situation that wasted your money, your time and not to mention you could have been seriously injured or worse. Of course none of it was intentional but you totally deserve a refund, I feel for you dude! Maybe the driver just ended the ride. BTW your ire is fart to Uber. So, some poor guy is carting your dumb ass from point A to B for next to nothing and has a wreak which probably ruined his only source of income and you, being the self-absorbed prick that you are, are only concerned with your $5.80, is that right? Stock price is in the toilet and they treat drivers like Sh\*t.  what do you expect? You got charged up to that point. Why do you think you should get a full refund.

How to pre-schedule a trip with two stops?,15,49.46287321833549,uber,"Hi fellow Uberizers, I searched here and found two posts from almost a year ago, was wondering if anything had changed or improved since then...

Trying to schedule a ride now for this Friday (two days from today) to take us from a local hospital to our hotel (get our bags) and then to the airport.

I can easily schedule a ride from the hospital to the hotel or from the hospital to the airport, but how do I pre-schedule the hotel stop before the airport?

What I don’t want to do is “surprise” the driver by adding a second stop to the route once we’re going, as this might not be what they signed up for, etc.

Any tips? Or should we try Lyft? Or take a taxi and ask them to wait at the hotel and then take us to the airport? Trying to be a courteous passenger.","Order the Uber from the hospital to the hotel. Then order another Uber from hotel to airport While Uber allows passengers to add stops to a trip, they recommend that those stops be no more than 3-5 minutes. If you can get your bags and check out within that time, then great. Definitely let the driver know before hand, just to be sure. 

If you think the stop will take longer than 5 minutes I'd recommend ordering a different Uber from the hotel to the airport. Lyft allows the passenger to schedule multiple stops in a single fare.  Both uber and lyft apps will automatically calculate mileage and time even if the destinations are not pre set.  It's in the passengers best interest to set one trip with multiple stops.  However, it is in drivers best interest to not have to wait for passengers at multiple stops since the biggest portion of money comes from mileage and not from time (unless the passenger tips very well.) Don't. From a driver, Thanks for being considerate.     

That said, a scheduled trip isn't what most people think. All it does is request a ride for you. The driver has no more prior notice than if you just requested the ride yourself. It also doesn't guarantee you a ride. But, in every major city you'll be able to get a ride pretty much any time. It's not 2 stops, it's 1 stop (at the hotel) and onto the final destination (the airport.) Tell the driver the bags are ready, it will be a quick stop and you tip in cash - not in the app. They will get a kick out of that and realize that you know what you're talking about (people always tell us they will tip in the app, especially when asking for favors and it's a red flag because most of the time it's a lie.)"

Long ride request in small city,7,49.9497482183548,uber,"I live in a pretty small city which only has 1 neighborhood in it and nothing else, the next city being at least 8-15 minutes away. Next week I’ll be requesting an estimated 1 hour and 20 minute trip to the airport. 

I plan to request a ride early in the morning around 5am. Whenever I check the map, there’s only a couple drivers there, around 2 or 5 drivers. What are the chances of them accepting a long ride? Should I request for an uber like 15 minutes before I’d want to get picked up so I wouldn’t get late? I also can’t schedule a ride in advance, probably because I live in a remote area.","No one can possibly know. Test it out. I’d say if you request early just make sure you’re ready early too. You never know the driver might be 5 mins away or 20 mins away. The amount of cars you see aren’t the actual amount of cars nearby all the time. I’m sure someone will accept it tho especially if your town is that small it would be gold for them. Most drivers prefer long rides, better money than short ones. How far away are the drivers when you see them? Yes, they may not be real. I wouldn't order just 15 minutes earlier. For the airport 30 minutes earlier is not a lot for your 1st time. I would text the driver a canned message as soon as he/she accepted it. An airport ride is usually profitable. Most drivers prefer long rides unless they are just about to end their shift. But in a small town and at an early hour you probably want to allow some extra time to get a driver. Also I suggest that you text or call the driver to tell them you’re taking a long trip to the airport to avoid a last minute cancellation."
How can I squash it with Uber?,8,49.95754914428073,uber,"Sorry for the title, I'm actually asking ""how can I find out if I can still use Uber, and pay a small unpaid bill""?

My last trip overseas I made a mistake, ordered a car that couldn't accommodate my large party of people + their baggage.

The driver did a thing and I was charged around $1.50.  

I tried a couple times to pay it in the app, but I was told that PayPal couldn't be accepted, and I should pay in cash on my next ride.  My best guess is because most drivers accept cash only where the charge occurred.

That was a trip to the airport to leave that country.  There's no Uber where I live, and there has not been a ride since.

Uber never sends me an email telling me i'm getting discounts. My rider rating is 4.86 if that matters.

Lyft is a lot more transparent about discounts, I usually get a $2 discount or so which often makes Regular Lyft cheaper than UberX so when I am in a rush I use Lyft. When I have all the time in the world I use Uber Pool because it is the cheapest option.","No point giving frequent riders discounts. Only makes sense to change behavior not sustain it You don't match the profile of someone who they gain revenue on by providing a discount. They're profiling your behavior.

Rider Scam,13,50.224910255416674,uber,"Had my first scam ride this weekend. Things were good - made $180 on Saturday night in about 5 hours. Got a notification today thru the app, as well as emailed, that I had a fare adjusted. WTF, I think to myself, I didn't submit any adjustments. Then I see that a short hop I did on Saturday night was fully refunded to the rider - the rider claims that I picked up the wrong rider, so Uber, without contacting me to verify anything - refunds them and hits my account not only for what they paid me, but for their full rate. 

Of course Uber's autobot message chastized me for not checking that I had the correct passengers - but I don't let people in the car until they confirm their name and reply with mine, and we don't move until I verify destination location or address. If I picked up the ""wrong"" passenger, they'd have said something and not gone 5 miles to the wrong house, in the middle of the night. 

The ride in question had a +$11 surge, and I think what happened was three days hence, the rider decided they didn't want to pay over $20 for a 5 mile trip. I disputed this - but I doubt anything will come of it. Pissed me off. I've already been irritated because of an increase in entitled brat riders not getting it that I'm not taking extra passengers over what they've requested, or more people than I have seat belts for, but now I'm getting scam artists who don't give a damn or who think that Uber will just refund their money and all is well. Of course Uber won't let us change passenger ratings after the fact, but I noticed that my driver rating went down from a 4.98 to 4.91 today as well. If we have to rate the riders immediately, passengers should have to as well. 

I've already been exploring other side gig options - the only thing attractive about driving for Uber at this point is the daily cash out options. I've had to rely on my income from Uber of late to help pay bills, because my primary business has been too slow for me to pay my bills on - but I'm getting sick of entitled ride share passengers and now scam artists. I already stopped driving for Lyft because of some similar crap.","Did you dispute this with Uber? Show them that you did not change the destination, nor did the passenger, yet somehow you still completed the ride? Yeah I have sent suggestions into Uber  about this as well.

What is the purpose of this? Anyone else had this happen? Is it some sort of new scam? Thanks","I’ve had it happen a few times where I literally couldn’t end the ride, my app wouldn’t let me. Which meant in my eyes if I kept on driving the passenger would get charged more. Both times I asked the passenger to cancel and it kicked me out of the frozen can’t cancel loop. Maybe that was it. They might suspect that you're going to rate them low. Cancellations prevent rating. Are these short rides where the driver is asking to cancel?  The only thing I can think of is your ride was so short, that they want you to cancel cause the cancel fee is more than the minimum fare.  I wouldn't cancel and either make them cancel or just leave as normal so they have to end the trip like normal. This is bizarre. Usually is passengers who cancel to get a free ride. Not sure what the angle would be for a driver. Since the driver has to open a support ticket to get paid for the trip my guess is there's some bug in that area and drivers are making more on the trip than they should when it gets recalculated. Check your bank account and make sure you arent being charged anything extra for the rides if you can remember the initial quotes. If it was a short ride, the driver receives more for a cancel than for giving the ride."
UberEATS charges different people different delivery fee and service charge,26,50.353012107290596,uber,"When I was trying to place an order, the delivery fee from my account was 14.99 due to ""high volume"". Obviously that is too high, so I decided to check just in case what the charge is from my friends account and it was 0.99. I waited for an hour and the prices remained the same. But what I also noticed, her service fee is always 15% from order, while mine has always been 10%. I took the screenshots from the same phone, for a same restaurant, same minute and same delivery location. I decided to go ahead with the order, hoping I would get the delivery difference back. Several email replies completely ignored what I was saying and kept repeating that the fee depends on how busy the area is, which was not true since I checked it and had a proof of the opposite. I even sent them the screenshots. They stopped replying after 3rd email and I called to the customer centre, where the woman seemed to be able to help. After checking my account she went back to saying the information from the email. Eventually, I asked her whether they just charge different people different fee and she said yes, so I asked to speak to her supervisor. After staying on hold my call has been dropped and I was sent an email saying that the phone call has been resolved. Second call did not produce any different result. I have not complained without a good reason before, but they seem to put my account in a different category. So now I just really wonder, if drivers even get the delivery fee or is it just claimed by Uber and driver gets the 0.99 after all. Is there any way to make them charge you normal price or is it all a lost cause?

https://i.redd.it/x48m66kcmnh31.png","Yes, they charge different people different prices. They do the same for rides. If you agree to the price, request the food or ride. If you don't agree to the price, don't request the food or ride.      


Don't agree to a price, request the food, then later ask for a refund cause someone else could get it cheaper. 14.99 delivery fee??? I’ve never seen that before. Yikes. Uber is an unethical company desperately in need of discipline, whether it's delivered by regulatory bodies (Europe) or litigation (United States). Uber charges (for food and riders) what they believe you are willing to pay based on your past purchase history with them as well as how much of the overall total check the restraunt is willing to cut Uber in on. 

If a restaurant is willing to give up a larger percent of the check to Uber then the lower the delivery fee goes and the higher up in presentation the restaurant goes in the app. I bet theres a nice class action lawsuit you can jump in on for this. Uber has different prices for people.  The less you use it, the lower the prices they charge you to try to get you to order more.  

Also, Uber inflates prices at restaurants in addition to a delivery fee. 
So what you want may be $5.99 at the restaurant.  Uber's menu will list it at $9.99 and then they will also charge you the 10% fee.   Uber hides the fact that they inflate menu prices.    

I also, never understood why people even use uber. Just drive to the restaurant to pick up food. Depend on the account , also if you are Ubereats regular or not ... new account usually cheaper since they have promotion, also they have weekly/monthly pass promotion ..

Once you used up the promo , then it’ll be regular price"

"Why are we encouraged to ""tip"" to get a good rider rating?",4,50.98291951473388,uber,"I don't understand the sentiment on these forums to tip for a good rider rating. I tip when I receive good service and nothing else. The drivers in my market are awful and I dont feel I should reward that with a tip. Thousand plus rides, 4.77, so I dont have a terrible rating or anything, but it just comes off as ridiculous that every advice here is to tip cash. Who even carries around cash anymore?

I get Uber pays you guys badly, and you drivers seem to be good, but trust me when I say a majority of drivers in certain markets are god awful, most dont speak english, and I literally see people texting and using their phone while driving 2/3 of all rides I take.","It's is the correct answer for those who care about their rating.     

A better answer is ""your rider rating doesn't matter at all and most drivers don't even look at it"". Uber knows their rates are garbage, impossible to get anything resembling a fair wage in most places. They added tipping do their app after years of stonewalling against it, right at the beginning of 2017 right after a severe rate cut.

Tips are part of the market equilibrium, a reality you have to accept if you want low prices. Star ratings are also tied into the market equilibrium. Anonymity and the rules of the ratings system only go so far. The cash tip thing is a nonsense wish from drivers. More and more people don't carry cash, many drivers are living in the past."

"Uber not refunding obviously bad route, need help",36,51.1060792369699,uber,Image,"was there construction on your preferred route? ive been getting wonky routes while driving because its veering me around both traffic and or construction lately and passengers have bitched to me about it but i sure know which chunks of I5 i cant go down in my general area. Only way this makes sense is if the GPS turns off toll road (520) and I-90 is closed. He must have totally ignored the GPS for quite a long time when he's near I-90. So, was the driver ignoring his navigation, or was he following the prescribed route? Because as a driver, I've ignored wonky looking directions at my own peril just a handful of times. I've learned to trust the app unless I know it makes no sense, like roads that don't exist, or driving an extra 3 miles to make a right turn instead of a left into a parking lot. Maybe your settings have tolls off but even i90 is toll free. That added like an hour to your ride Ask for a ride credit. Refunds are damn near impossible now for many. What’s the benefit to the driver here? Not like he gets paid extra for driving in circles, this ends up costing the dude time which is his money. Gotta speak up, just like back when I used to take cabs. It should refund you within a few hours if you dispute it over the app Bahahaha oh man that's classic. What did you say to the driver? They won't refund you for this? I've gotten credit for less.. I am on Platinum though if that matters. Google maps is the worst during traffic. Waze is better if you trust that blue line too much you're doing it wrong Did you ask the driver to take a different route? Since you did ride this entire destination I do think that you should have to pay the full amount however they should have credited you something just not the entire trip. Its not the drivers fault but Uber needs to get their shit together with the gps sometimes."
Rider rating 4.25 / 9 rides,26,51.27854451475596,uber,"I just checked my rider rating recently and I'm really confused why it's so low. And as I've only done 9 rides it's exceptionally confusing 

I'm polite I'm quiet I don't slam the door  I don't keep the driver waiting. I don't eat or drink in the back 3 of those rides the drivers weren't being professional either  

What makes drivers give riders low ratings  ? I really don't understand what I'm doing wrong  if I was an arse hole fair enough  but I'm not  only thing I can think of is sometimes I've just smoked before getting in. So I smell of smoke.","There are some drivers who may rate low for the smell, as well some may rate lower if you don't tip regularly. You may try, if you care about the rating, tipping with a couple dollars in cash for the next several rides. I will rate low for smoke smell.  That shit lingers and non-smokers are very sensitive to it. The next passenger may rate me low if they smelled smoke in the car and thought it was me.

If you're going to smoke while waiting for a ride, blow the smoke up and away from you. Smoke can lingers on your clothes and the smell will rub into the seats. Don't take a ""last drag"" just before getting in. Your lungs will still contain smoke and your next few breathes will expel the smoke into the car! Take a few deep exhales before getting in. 

Also, like another mentioned, Uber may be doing something fishy. Talk to your next driver and see if your ratings match! This comes up quite often. Why were you rated low?

-You’re too white. 

-Too black. 

-Too Mexican. 

-Too Asian. 

-Too (insert ethnicity here). 

-Too fat. 

-Too skinny.

There’s millions of reasons to get a low rating. It sounds like you’re doing everything you can to be a good rider, so don’t worry. Give it time and your ratings will stabilize. Start tipping in cash. Drivers will rate low for plenty of reasons but we will almost never rate someone less than 5 stars for a cash tip. It was likely a single driver rating you low specifically to not be matched with you again.  For whatever the reason, probably one of the unprofessional ones you mentioned had a bad day.  Maybe they got routed from a bit of distance away, some drivers utilize the rating feature to thin out ride requests from outside the area they prefer to work in.  Or maybe they're a bigot or misogynist, if either apply.  In any case, don't let the opinions of assholes ruin your day. OP I will tell you why you are most likely getting the low rating.

You live in LA or NYC or have traveled to those area.  Even Chicago can be the culprit, these 3 cities have drivers and passengers handing each other out 1 stars like there is no tomorrow because of factors like ""Running late to meetings"" or drivers that are pissed about other stuff.  

Or you smell, or you sit up in the front seat and you do some weird seat adjusting stuff and lean way back.  List can go on and on, maybe you shut trunks or doors super hard. Out of a potential 45 stars possible if you were ranked 5 stars on every ride, you have gotten 38 stars. Divided by 9, that's 4.22 or approximately your rating. As far as why you were rated that, I have no idea. the ratings you see vs what the drivers see are different.  you're being tricked because they've run psychological tests and found that some riders care about their ratings and are more likely to get more rides 'to fix it'. Handing someone  cash at the end of a ride always helps with your rating. Im not saying tiping is a must just like tiping your waitress  is not a must my bad rating is cuz im too drunk but im not rude or mean and dont slam doors, just wobbly, wtf is uber even for besides taking me home when im melted? You might be getting rated low for short rides, the smell and maybe being too quiet. If you’re so quiet you don’t say hello or thank you you might be coming off as unfriendly and rude. Some drivers are just jerks but if you’re consistently getting low ratings something must be wrong.

Tip cash even if it is only a $1 or 2 to help get high ratings. Reading this thread, the only reason I think Im at 4.67 is because I don't tip in cash, but for most rides I do tip.  
If driver's are gonna be picky about their tips like that to where they are disrupting my chances of driver's accepting to drive me, I may as well not tip at all. I don't carry cash on me so I literally cannot tip in cash.  
I feel like Im generous with tips too. If I do so much as cough on the driver's seat, I tip them highly as an apology.  
Maybe the culprit this one time was this dude whose phone died and wanted me to bring his phone inside to charge it and then cancel the ride. I felt like that was bullshit so I said no and then cancelled the ride when he got me to my destination. Probably gave me a 1 star even though it was his fault- I really don't feel like waiting for your phone to charge in my dorm, lol You create a thread to say your rating is low? WTF is wrong with people nowadays?"
Duplicate Uber charges,5,51.36730608884107,uber,"I took 2 rides on Aug/10 and Uber charged me twice for the first trip. (no issue with the second ride)

When I contacted Uber, they told me that one of them is an authorization hold and they have voided one.

They told me that the reversal usually happen within 3 to 5 business days and I should see and I can also contact my bank to verify that.

On Aug/17, I checked PayPal and my bank account and nothing like they said happened.

I contacted Paypal and was told none of those payments are voided.

I went back to Uber to told them what I have discovered and hope that they can correct this issue.

They told me that they have voided one of the transaction, they have no visibility for anything is voided, and asked me to contact my bank when I will get the money.

I contact PayPal one more time today.

PayPal double check and confirm that they didn't receive any transaction void request from Uber.

As the transaction is completed, Uber will get the money and they need to refund the money to me. (no one can void completed transaction)

I go back to Uber and they kind of ignore anything I said and just repeat what they told me to check with the bank when I will get the money.

Does anyone have any suggestion how I can get my money back?

The reason for the low rating? I use Uber mostly in Latin America and there's they'll tank you easily for not paying the fare in cash and/or not tipping in cash.

Uber Comfort,18,51.95795423702509,uber,"I’ve started using Uber comfort and have my setting at prefer not to talk and prefer a cool temperature.

For some reason every time I’ve used comfort this week the drivers won’t stop talking and I feel pressured to respond. They even acknowledge my request yet continue to talk and have the music on. I’m wondering if these requests are suggestions? Do drivers not understand it? Is it me?

I’m honestly thinking of switching back to Uber x because i get the same type of vehicles anyways.","I dont get what's so hard about not talking to people. After I confirm the person's name and I greet them, I wont say a word to the pax unless they talk to me first. 90% of my rides are ""Hello, uber for blank, how are you today...... thank you have a nice day"" Uber tells drivers that, ""With Ride Preferences, your rider can request their ideal temperature and let you know if they *wish to chat*, all before you arrive.""

Normally I drive around with non-controversial music playing as low as it can while still being audible.  When my first Comfort request came across with a preference for quiet, I muted the music.  And the ride was awkward!  The two people in the back seat attempted to whisper to each other rather than carry on a normal conversation.  So now I don't alter the music from my normal preference unless someone asked me to or if I hear them initiating a phone call.  Even then, I worry that the rider will misinterpret my action and assume that I'm trying to listen in on their phone call rather than let them talk without distraction.

Most of us would rather give the rider what they want than have a contentious ride or risk a bad rating ourselves.  We can't read minds, so the easiest way to get what you want is to ask.

Incidentally, I really wish Uber would give more detailed preferences on temperature, or at least define what warm and cold mean.  When I see cold, I turn the temperature down to 70 if it's not already, and when I see warm, I set it to 72.  I have no idea what other people consider warm or cold. While those options are preferences for Uber Comfort, they aren't required for drivers to follow. Uber Black I believe has the same options, and is considered top-tier. I believe those drivers would adhere more strictly to the preference requests. 

That being said, I feel like those drivers are missing an opportunity to offer better customer service by not adhering to your preference requests. I heard they give pampers to comfort riders to ride in. Try uber Select those drivers are being paid well enough they will do whatever it takes to provide good service if asked. If you dont want to he talked to just wear headphones and ask if they could turn their music down because you're on a conference call.

Right on the Uber app it now says “now you can earn points abroad” - when you open that, it’s a message from Uber legal from July 25, 2019 outlining the program. Great, right? Well none of the rides from my trip abroad counted towards my reward points. When I reached out to Uber about this, out of the seven people I talked to (mixed results that contradicted themselves), two said that I am eligible and the trip I was on was eligible and they weren’t sure why the points hadn’t counted (they even sent a couple of paragraphs about how the program works and how the currency is converted and then applied it to your account once you get back to the United States)... while the other five said there is no such program and that Uber rewards are only available on rides in the US. It’s clearly right on the app that it is eligible and that I should have received points, but anytime I reference this and have even screenshoted the app and of the legal release wording for the program, they just respond back with stock reply language saying that there is no such program and that it’s only applicable in the United States.

Getting a portion of the surge?,10,52.96127599633127,uber,Image,"It’s always been like that... you just have to be at the peak of surge and take the ride fast , downsurge residue is what most people get Been this way the whole time the new surge was implemented. If the passenger is paying surge and the surge is active, it can adjust upward ononger trips.     

If you get the surge as a ""sticky surge"" and it dies down or you get a request outside of the active surge area, so the passenger isn't actually paying a surge price, you'll only get the actual amount on your screen. Yep it's always been like that. Max I got was a 36 + Pool pick up fees This feature is not new. I seem to get this bump when picking up in a surge area with along ride drop off. This typically happens when you're picking up someone who is actually paying the surge fare. Uber understands that it's bad PR for drivers to post rides where Uber took 70% of the fare, leaving drivers  30%. 

Apparently, Lyft has not learned this very important PR lesson yet. Only during event .... park ur car by the event exit one hour before , if you are online during major surge , you will get it ..

During golf tournament , I got $100 up surge on top of $20 for $40 ride , with tips $15

Totaling $175ish lol so they just make shit up now.  you're a contractor that doesn't know what he's being paid until after you do it.  good luck with that."
"90-mile to airport, 70mph interstate, no traffic, $150 uber ride.... how much should I tip? (or how much will the drive expect?)",19,53.01250284819691,uber,"90-mile to airport, 70mph interstate, no traffic, $150 uber ride.... 

just myself and my laptop. no bags of any kind.

how much should I tip? 

or....  how much will the drive expect?

Thanks!","id probably tip 20 on that fare dependent on the driver i suppose. Driver makes $85 and it takes almost 4 hours round trip. Just to drive my car 180 miles it cost roughly $36 for gas, repairs and estimated depreciation  that’s leaves me with $49 for let’s call it 3.5 hours of driving round trip. That’s $14 per hour before taxes.  If you tip a $20 that brings my average up to $19.71 per hour. 

So I’d say tip at least a $20

Of course it’s possible to get a ride on the way back but at 70mph on the highway you don’t get many pings. That guy isn't getting a good deal. Tip 25% of your fare on long trips from or to rural areas, or that go clear into a different metro area. $35.

The return miles would make for $4/hr earnings after expenses, in my market. Your ride being fulfilled shockingly relies on your driver simply being unaware of that. It’s still $ 10-20 is good Even if he need to deadhead back to where he picked you up, he couldn't have done better if you tip him gas money for 90 miles, and $0.20 per min for the one-way trip back. If that's a good airport where he can get a trip back to town, it's an excellent trip. Anything over 60 miles and you should tip $20 its 150 on your side, fyi.  what the driver earns is something else depending on your market

At least 10 bucks would cover the guys gas back to where he started....20+ would be nice At least a fifty. 2 hour min drive back empty. Back breaking. Consider a lunchbreak for the driver with that 50. [deleted] Do a % tip 10-15%. nice They’re making great money in the trip even if they went empty on the return, which is unlikely since they’re ending at an airport. I don’t see a tip here."

I tried to ignore it but after a while I asked for some Panadol because headache pain is the one thing I can’t handle but my friend didn’t have any. By this time it was late and my head hurt too much to drive so I reached out to Uber in desperation. I put in the location of a service station as my pickup point and my friends house as the drop off point. Once a driver accepted I sent them a message and explained my situation and asked if they could please pick me up some Panadol and drop it back to my friends place. The first driver cancelled the ride but I tried again and the second time was a charm. When the driver arrived I ran outside, thanked him profusely and asked how much I owed him but he said not to worry about it and hoped I felt better. Needless to say, he got a massive tip.

But hats off to the driver hope they enjoy the karma I would have cancelled after message. This is a drive pax service, not concierge.

I like the story, and it demonstrates a pretty nifty way of using Uber, and I don’t know if it is my cynical side that I don’t believe someone on the Internet saying they tipped their Uber driver— but didn’t, but I think it’s not too outlandish to ask for proof that you actually did in fact leave a tip!"
Ubering from a concert? Is it a nightmare?,13,54.16046581119023,uber,"I don’t Uber often at all, planning on using Uber for a rather large concert next week. Is it an ordeal generally? I will be in Atlanta area","if the venue has a shuttle option to get away from the venue before catching an uber id use it. half the time i attempt to pick people up from our local venue i cant even get to where they are because they have the roads blocked and then when they dont block the roads i cant find the damn people and ive got 10 other groups trying to get in my car. In general you might find easier to walk a short distance from a busy event like a concert before requesting a ride, as long as it's safe. Different venues handle ride-sharing traffic with varying levels of efficiency, but even the best ones might get a bit congested. One way to plan your evening if it appeals to you is to walk a half mile or mile to a local bar, hang out there for a bit, and order your ride from there. If walking isn't your thing, you can almost certainly get a ride from the venue, but expect a wait and probably a little confusion. Communication with the driver helps. Some large venues have a system where there is just a line of ubers and you get in one and give the driver a code uber gave you and you are on your way Be prepared for surge pricing, if there's a code pickup, and also prepared to walk. For large events parking lots are usually closed off and pickups are either further away or in a designated area. Be flexible if the driver says can you walk to this area. Know your general area around the stadium lots or the blocks outside the area. This will all be super helpful in making your life and the drivers life easier. 

Tip your driver because more than likely he won't be getting wait time because he's not at the pin (unreachable) It's entirely dependent on the venue.  One venue I go to, Uber is allowed to pick you up right on the street just outside, and the parking is spread far and wide, so there's not a whole lot of traffic. 

 Contrast that with the Cowboy's Stadium in Arlington.  It took me 2 hours to get OUT of the parking lot after an event, and it wasn't even football game, I can't imagine waiting on an Uber there. Be prepared for a huge surge. To be honest I almost recommend taking a limo bc my husband once did a Uber trip after a kid rock concert and they paid $200 my husband got like 120 of that yes, anywhere Just a wait.."
Uber cannot ever find my location,12,54.16960932972255,uber,"For the life of me, no matter what I do, the Uber app cannot locate my house.

You have to submit about eight times your correct address and maybe eventually they will actually fix it.

uber maps are terrible at updating.

we hate showing up where the map takes us...and then you call and say the map is always wrong....well if you knew that why dont you give us a heads up Type your home address on Google Map and see how your house turns up on the map. Maybe ask for the directions from a few miles away. People are saying it's Google's fault, but it might be tied to routing info from OpenStreet Map. See how your house shows up with routing on https://www.openstreetmap.org/  If it's wrong, there are ways that you can edit OpenStreet Map, but it might take a while to get fixed at Uber. If you can send your driver better clear and concise directions when you are paired it would help the driver. Something like ‘Hi! The location marker is accurate but the directions provided to drivers by Uber to my house have been really goofy and incorrect in the past. The best way to get here is...Just wanted to let you know as soon as possible so we can find one another efficiently. Thanks so much! :) call or message if you have any questions or clarifications’ Drop off at a different address, either neighboring house for example instead of 67 Main St, do 65 or 66 Main St. Before requesting a car it should show an estimated path of your route Anyone know anything about how my saved address could change...I mean I used it maybe 5 to 6 times no problems. Use the app ONCE you reached your location, not from inside a building, home, office, bathroom, etc. Also, if using your 'location', that is based on your gps location. If you have the gps off, it's triangulating using the towers, not the actual location. Make sure your gps is on at least a min before using the app, so it connects to su least 3 satellites for good gps location.

I’m curious to hear more reasons on why Uber is declining in popularity? 

What bad expirences have you had with them?

Should I drop uber completely?","Uber do surge better than lyft , hence more expensive, hence more driver prefer uber to make more $ .

Lyft still around due to the car rental they give to the drivers , and kept the driver from driving for uber while they in lyft rental.

Drivers usually work for multiple rideshare platform including local ones in selected cities , and as for me , I drive for uber more than lyft just because uber have more market than lyft (75/25%) at least in my cities, and also I can see the surge in uber , while on lyft it’s rarely happens due to more lyft rental drivers around Sure thing, buzzfeed author They have terrible customer support. I lost my sunglasses in an Uber and they were super unhelpful. They have no hotline for customers. Even when you talk to them over the app, they offer no solution. I tried for 2 weeks to get my glasses back, never did. Customer support, market disrupter, low wages. They set the ball park for half the rates of taxi companies, eventually they'll have to increase till then they'll keep crushing companies. 

Lyft is really the same shit, but it doesn't have the same perception... Yet Requested an Uber at last call, given a 5 minute ETA. 20+ minutes and 5 ignored phone calls later, the driver cancelled the trip.

UberEats driver sat in my driveway and ate my dinner.,7,54.67975979271863,uber,"Backstory: I'm a platinum member and use Uber Black routinely for business purposes often ordering multiple vehicles at once.

Called support while I watched this guy eating my dinner - they refused to help aside from giving me a refund (2 weeks until credited back to my card) and telling me to order again and hope the next driver is better. Most infuriating, they defended the drivers cancelation because he marked it 'customer refused delivery'.

Some places you have 5-8min to pick up your food from the car. In my small market we deliver to door. Did you take s pic or video, did he get out of the car? He should be deactivated.

Waving to get driver’s attention?,39,54.758417200139824,uber,"I called an uber at the FLL airport and the ride came. He was on his phone and was driving slowly through the pickup loop. He wasn’t looking up so I flashed the color that pops up next to the drivers profile. Didn’t work, didn’t look like he saw it. So I pushed through some people to get to where he slowed down a little more and tried to wave but he still wasn’t looking up from the phone. So I tried to call and of course no pickup, but then he peered up for a second. I waved one more time and he stopped the car. Then he got out of the car and said “find another ride, your waving is rude and obnoxious”.... 
I dunno, I’m not sure if waving is taboo? Its sort of tough not being skipped up by an uber in FLL because often they don’t see you (the pickup loop is a mess). I always try to self describe in the messages beforehand and it works most of the time. But this guy was furious when he got out.","Hahaha! What a big baby. He screwed himself by cancelling. Any rider that waves to me makes my job easier. Sounds like you avoided riding with an arrogant jerk. You dodged a bullet and did nothing wrong Yeah.. What the hell? Waiving is ride & obnoxious? The universal signal for ""hello""? You did nothing wrong. This person sounds ridiculous..

I am admittedly annoyed that we drivers do not get a picture of the person we're picking up. I have to rely on them verbally confirming their name. In Vegas, all the casinos are like a giant pickup loop and waiving while looking in my direction does nothing to help me identify you because there's a 50/50 chance I'm not your driver. It's annoying, but it's not the passangers fault. It's the design of the app withholding important visual information. Don't passengers take a pic in order to have an uber profile? It's so weird to me Waving is not taboo. That person was an irrational jerk. A potential passenger waving makes my job easier as a driver and I really appreciate it. It’s difficult for me that half of my passengers do not wave or give any indication that they are the person I am there to get because as drivers we don’t get a photo of the passenger .  One of my silent pet peeves is a passenger in a busy location that gives absolutely no indication they are the one I’m looking for and simply walks toward the car and opens the door without a word! RUDE! FLL pickup is chaos. Taxis get full priority and are allowed to pick up at sidewalk. Uber/Lyft are required to pick up only at 1 of 3  rideshare location stations that are usually a hundred pax deep all waving. Not for me. Only thing worse is Port cruise ship pick ups. Those color pop ups are useless. Daytime well lit pick ups render those things invisibly useless. 

P S The driver queue waiting lot is typically 200 drivers deep and miles from the terminals and resembles a migrant camp. No excuse for his exchange but .... waving? Hell yeah! Cuz I don't know what you look like and getting my attention like that is hella useful.

That guy sounds like a jerk. I appreciate when pax wave me down. 

Maybe wave a little less sarcastically? /s

Honestly it sounds like a cranky driver you were probably better off not getting in his car. You're doing the right thing by waving him down. I wish all passengers would do this. That person is an idiot and you lucked out not riding with them.


I've had people stand there as I drive by multiple times at a mall until they get annoyed that I'm not stopping and wave me down. Once there was like 80 people all waiting on ride share at a main door at a huge mall in Atlanta, all looking on their phones, she didn't have a profile picture and the name was ""J"".  She has my picture, tag number, car make, model and color. Who does she think is more capable here? She was pissed, if i shout out my name or the pasenger name anybody could jump in. Sure I could check her screen after but why use a method that's a hassle and have a high failure rate. I tried to explain that to her that I can't identify her without a picture but she was having none of it and 3 starred me, I gave her numeral uno. A mind is terrible thing to waste but you see a lot of wasting in this job. 😆 Curious,,,what ethnicity is he ? I give a little smile and wave all the time, even if I am the only one around... Lol never had an issue... Someone was just severely menstrual... Don't worry about that guy... I know what you mean, Ive gotten an uber at FLL a couple times and it is a mess Just curious , also for research I love it when a pax waves in a crowded situation as it makes it easier for both of us.

What I don't like though is when they get done waiving and then run up to my car if I'm not just plowing my way right over to them.

Sorry, but I'm not going to pick you up in a dangerous (middle of the road) or illegal location (e.g., bus stop).

I get this most often at airports (LAX) where I can be fined for not being within the white pickup lanes when on boarding a pax. I just did a personal pick up at fll late last night, the loop was the worst I’ve seen in 16 years, it took about 15 min to get though all 4 terminals in the traffic. I honestly feel like I have the easiest job in the world until I hit the tunnel and have to find one person in a sea of passengers.  

Your driver probably just couldn’t handle the traffic and started to road rage before he even saw you waiving, but please waive and get our attention it’s the only way we won’t have to circle 2 and 3 times. It’s these kinds of drivers that make the rest of us look bad. You should report this driver and Uber should not be allowing these kinds of people to drive for them.

I mean if you don’t like your job this much, then don’t work anything related to customer service. It is so bizarre to hear the stories of drivers acting like arrogant assholes after I spent so long as the driver bending over backwards to be as courteous as I could to all the wild riders that I got. So it goes lol... Some drivers are way too sensitive. I'm a driver and honestly I will stop for a wave or not even a look because I want that fare were you at the pickup point, if there was one? That driver can go fuck himself. I wish I encountered more riders like you. Consider yourself lucky to avoid this idiot!  He should NEVER look down at his phone while driving through a crowded passenger pickup area.  At the least when he noticed you waving, best to make eye contact and a polite wave back.  Looks like he saw you wave, and chose to ignore you.  What an absolute idiot.  Please report this piece of garbage Being that this is still an issue means your were probably being rude, in an entitled typ of way.. he sensed  your vibe ,with the calling and waving...your at the airport,there is a pickup point...just chill untill they get there and make a stop...drivers are people( underpaid people), people that get you to were you need to be.. and if they think at all that you will give them a low rating they will just cancel..people have pride. And respect is not worth the littel amount of money  they will get for that ride..(fare-ubers portion-25%taxes-gas used =shit)..anybody doing uber is in a bad way.. this is their last resort.  To put it in perspective.. if your doing uber fulltime, you cant aford the airplain ticket  you just used...it might not be you it might be all the other people before you; you may have just exhibited  same behavior and dont act like the people  that downvote drivers.. Sounds like some snowflake that voted for Hillary.
 You're much better off without that person in your life.
 That's a very badd example of what drivers represent Either you lack basic confidence in yourself or you just want to bitch about this guy in the most passive aggressive way. Idk I’ll disagree with most drivers here. 

Waving frantically like a duck with one wing trying to take flight is super obnoxious. We see you. And chances are, in those super hectic pickup situations, we’re not looking for YOU, we’re looking for a safe spot to park where it’s not illegal, and not going to cause an accident. That’s priority numero uno. Flap your wings all you want little ducky, It’s not going to change where I stop. I try my best to get as close as possible to the pin, but if I can’t, start walking. 

Although it’s rude, it’s not something I would cancel for. But I’ll absolutely make fun of riders for it and make it weird so they don’t do it again. “Were you attempting to land a plane?” Is usually my go to dig. 

Downvote away, just being honest."
What do you do with car seats,30,54.97163479274346,uber,"I have ran into a few times, and would feel bad leaving a child stranded in some situations because of their parents negligence. But how do some of you handle when people have kids and no booster seat, car seat, etc I have had maybe two people that responsibly put their kid In the car. I don’t want to be a dick and cancel while I’m right in front of them, can they rate you if you cancel? Also it is a huge legal and safety liability","The straight forward answer is to cancel due to safety concerns. If something should happen to that child during the ride it is on you. Any reasonable parent will understand you don't want to put their child at risk. It's also a reason why I take my child's care seat out when I start driving for the day. It's a libility you just can't take. Do not start any ride until you've determined that the parent has the appropriate car seat.  You can cancel the ride and select the option that says no car seat. The rider can't rate you. 

Rideshare drivers are not exempt from child safety laws and you will be ticketed if pulled over.  And then most likely deactivated.

I've had a larger than normal percentage of riders trying to take children these last 2 weeks. I try to let them know about legally available transportation options that they can use instead. They all have tried to argue with me, telling me that it's ok, they give me their permission. I've had to firmly tell them all that it's not ok, and I'm not comfortable breaking the law. If they won’t fit properly in the regular seat , they need to have car seat .. no exception As a parent... Just cancel and don't feel and about it. A cheap, totally legal car seat is 30 bucks. Any time I get in an entitled parent who tries to get a child in my car without a booster or car seat I simply say to them sure you can ride in the car but please keep in mind I am immediately calling child protective services and showing them my Dash Cam footage of the entire ride and you planning them in eminent danger. They cancel real quick. Car seats are the law and we are not required to carry them as a driver but the parents are responsible for their own car seats. I had one lady call me before I got to her house to pick her up and asked me if I had two car seats. And I said no I have grown children why would I have car seats in my Uber and she hung up on me and canceled the ride. My biggest problem is that the people who want to bring their small children without a seat do not speak English You dont need a car seat on a plane. That is more dangerous. 
If it is legal in your area then I would not care.  
If illegal to where the driver gets a ticket then you deny the ride.

Uber fare was doubled,5,55.13574358905079,uber,"So my mom and I went on an uber to eat at a location nearby, charging only 7 dollars. Going back to our hotel, in an uber, the driver missed a turn and somehow the fare was 16 dollars there was a time increase of about 2 - 3 minutes, so I assume it would be 1- 1.5 dollars per minute, not 3-4 dollars per minute. I tried to open a support ticket but couldn't find anything related to this. Is this normal? Can I do anything about this or it is how it is.

&#x200B;

EDIT: We got uber to refund our 8 dollars or so. Yay!","First, check the length of the route from your original pickup to your destination. How far? 1 mile? 2km?

Second, do the same for the return trip. How far off is it? 50% more? 75% more? 

It could be a scam where the driver takes a longer route on purpose to milk you for more money. It could be surge. The length of the trip will tell you a lot to start. What was the price listed before you accepted the ride??? If it was $7 then I would open any ticket and ask for the difference back.  
Stating one price up front and then charging you more is a bait and switch. Was there a surge? What was the quoted fare for the return trip?"
Scary driver,39,55.155951922384126,uber,"I have a friend who rode in an Uber a couple days ago. He has now sent her about 9 messages after the ride requesting to meet up or asking how she is doing. She responded with “thank you for the ride, have a good one” after he texted the first time. At this point, he has sent pictures and texts to her trying to get her attention. After the 8th message and no reply on her end. She blocked his number.

2 hours later and he has now got another number and is pouring his feelings out for her over one Uber ride. Asking for her to unblock his number, meet with him, etc. 

She has reported the gentlemen to Uber, is there anything else she can do? 

He dropped her off at her house and she is now scared to stay there because he knows it’s her house.

Edit: because this post actually blew up I thought I would just respond here. Uber refunded her for her ride and apologized for what she went through. She DID NOT give out her number. None of her friends gave the number to him. I do not know how he got her number, whether it was through Uber or he found it somewhere online. I understand that you are all calling this fake but it is not. This is a real thing. 

At the end of the day. I gave him a call and spoke with him. Told him to stop or I will call the police on him. He apologized and said he would stop.","So she gave the driver her number and regret it? Reporting him is about all you can do. If it escalates or continues, call the police.

Pro tip: Always get picked up and dropped off down the street from your house. Since it doesn't seem like he is threatening your friend you won't have any luck with the police, however if he were to text her again I would advise to threaten him with the police. Just a simple ""If you attempt to contact me again I am going to the police.""   
I'm sorry your friend is going through that and that this happens. I have this very pretty friend who gets hit on often by Uber drivers so when asked where she's going she usually says friend's or boyfriend's house. So it sounds like your friend regrets giving their number out. I know for a fact they cover numbers anytime a rider has called it is always from a Cali area code (which protects riders and drivers) and they have messaging in the app which can only be used on that trip. People need to stop making Uber sound bad for their own ignorance. It’s a side income to some people and if people were a little more cautious, nothing bad would happen. I for one even canceled a ride cause “someone’s friend” ordered it for them, the name was Betty and I can tell you this was not a Betty. Play stupid games win stupid prizes... This is 100% false or the facts are false, below the OP says she did not give the driver her number and pretty much everyone here knows that this story is fake if she in fact did not give her number out. If she's dumb enough to give out her number... You invited the harassment by giving your phone number and then came here to blame the driver for the consequences? What kind of medication are you on? When was the last time you took your meds? Thank you all for the suggestions and tips. I know this is something that rarely happens but when it does it is a little scary.

I personally gave him a call and had a nice chat with him that he needs to stop. Dont ride uber pool."
Can you do anything about riders lying about the ride?,8,55.307051459434966,uber,"Just got an email saying I was reported for picking up the wrong rider, on a ride I made 14 days ago. I lost the 6.94 I made from that ride. 

It's not about the money, it's about the principle to me. Every single ride I make I ask the pax what their name is and make sure its correct, and have never started a ride without a pax. When I click on the email that says we want to hear your side, contact us it brings me to a blank page","Do you have a dashcam?  That's another way you could prove the pax is scamming.  Everyone says they don't look at the footage, but it just makes your case bullet proof that you are innocent.  Lol 14 days ago and the pax is saying you picked up the wrong rider, that's a red flag right there that Uber decided to ignore. Reply through the app. Alternatively you can open up a new ticket and just reference the adjusted fare incident. Just dispute it saying it is obviously horseshit, they always give it back to you. They just *want* to get away with refunding their precious scamming pax to keep them happy and see if you call their bluff. Had the same issue today with a ride last night.  I replied to Uber right away via the app that I'd be able to produce dashcam footage showing me confirming the rider's name and destination.  When I later sent Uber a secure/private link to video of the entire ride, they credited my account within five minutes.  I probably spent more time on it than the small fare was worth, but at that point it was the principle of the thing. Was it a coincidence that ""wrong"" pax had same destination as the ""rel"" pax? I seriously doubt that they would accept any dash cam video. I love how they always seem to take pax at their word without checking in with you for your side of the story. I just started a similar thread - my passenger waited 3 days, claimed wrong passenger pickup - it was a 5 mile trip with a +$11 surge - my cut was $19.75 - when they refunded the ride, Uber dinged me for the $19.75 PLUS their goddamn fees, so not only did I get screwed out of the money, but they charged ME for their fees for my trouble. I've disputed it, but have not heard anything back Luber is a great company to work for."
Does Uber XL have LATCH system for car seats?,7,55.35267645943496,uber,Traveling with a toddler and our own immi go car seat. We are thinking of getting an Uber XL from airport. Will it have the latch system? A quick search said most cars 2002 and newer have the LATCH system.,"As long as it's a newer vehicle, yes. > A quick search said most cars 2002 and newer have the LATCH system.

Most will have it Some cars have really bizarre LATCH systems but pretty much anything on Ubers platform has it.

Some older cars still on the platform will only have the LATCH system in certain seats.  The 2007 Yukon XL without captain's chairs, for example, only has the full LATCH system available in the passenger side seat of the middle row, and the rear row only has one lower anchor sort of in the middle of the rear row near the floor.  This older, but very popular, SUV doesn't have the latch system marked at all, you just have to look at the seat and figure out what you're looking at.

Compact cars (and smaller SUVs, like the Explorer) typically have 3 available latch positions in the back seat, but you can only use either the center seat or the two outboard seats, not all three, and some of the anchor positions overlap (if you see two really close together you'd usually use the one further from the seat)

All that being said, be aware that there is an upper weight limit for the LATCH system front anchors, usually around 40 pounds, and beyond that weight you should use the considerably stronger seatbelts instead ALONG with the rear tether strap.  Be sure to pull the belt out all the way so it locks after routing it through the car seat. While the car will probably have LATCH, a belt install is just as safe and usually a whole lot faster (especially in an unfamiliar vehicle). Suggest you make sure you know how to do both (not rocket science). 

For liability reasons most drivers won't help with an install, so be prepared to do it yourself."
Am I the only one who has problem with audio notifications of rides,12,55.42319729277657,uber,"Screen flashes. phone vibrates, no audio notification tone. Lyft app works fine, just Uber. IOS/android,.Samsung. Just installed the latest Uber driver app.","The Uber app always fucks with my podcast volume It's a Bluetooth issue with Android.  Go in your settings for bluetooth and only have ""phone""  through bluetooth.  
My workaround is if I want music off my phone I use the aux cord. THEN you'll get sound through your car. That's the ONLY way it'll work right now. (Or just regular through the phone sound) P S. Has worked just fine for over 16 months. Now it doesn't. At least Uber asks you if you want to accept the ride......Lyft just adds the next ride without you saying yes or no. Check the voice setting in the app settings. I have to set the night mode to automatic from time to time even though it is always on automatic. Have a similar situation, but mine started when I added Android 
Auto to my phone. 

Prior to that, I got phone and music through bluetooth, and Uber notification sound came from the phone speakers. Since adding Android Auto, the only way I can hear the Uber ping is to connect phone to car via USB, and now the pings come through the car speakers. (I use Android Auto on another vehicle, but not on the car I use for Uber) Same here. Lyft works great but Uber is quiet. I thought it was my Bluetooth connection, but ruled that out turn off bluetooth and notification ring will come in every time. Dumb question, is your ringer switch turned off? I’ve noticed sometimes the audio acts up when the switch is on/off. Same deal with Bluetooth. Lyft seems to be better here, with their chimes and audio notifications. Uber doesn't even have a particular ""sound"" with it."
Curious question. My cousin is 17 currently but her birthday is in 6 months. I also constantly joke about this her that she looks 15 but she’s a senior high school.

Uber CEO tells employees that he's cutting costs like 'anniversary balloons' as nervous engineers worry about layoffs,13,56.44685470020605,uber,Image,"Nintendo ceo for example , take care his employee and in Japan ceo salary is capped at x number of the  the lowest employees makes.... 

Honda ceo is also a great one ..

But maybe I’m wrong , but as far as I know Most Japanese ceo / Japanese worker are to work on one company and stay there til their retirement So that is where our good rates went, into Balloons to celebrate the anniversary of employees. Good, they can get a taste of their own and write some code to deactivate themselves. Suckers. If the engineers are so afraid of losing their jobs, why don’t they just switch to be mechanics? I hear they’re high paying jobs. Hmm...employees are worried about layoffs just like taxi owners..? Ceo nowadays are smart and cutthroat, they need to todo this because not many of them only have to work in a company for 5-10 years instead of 20-lifetime , they always think in 5-10 years future and not long term .. and their salary should have been capped , ceo with insane amount of salary , golden parachute , bonuses do not  think for the good of the company and its employees, they think about their future when they quit the company"

Uber needs some sort of human support,30,56.46357923725689,uber,"I just had a driver who claimed to have picked me up, pocketed my money, but proceeded to drive 30 minutes without me in the car. I called him, explained it, and he just hung up on me. He ignored every call and text after that. After giving up, I cancelled the ride. I am now an hour late for work and out the money for the ride. There is little to nothing I can do about it either.","This can be easily sorted out if you contact support. They would be able to see that your GPS position never changed while the ride continued along. It’d be pretty evident in the data that you’re telling the truth, so you should be refunded. Have you contacted Uber's support about this?  As far as I can tell right now, [this is you](http://i.imgur.com/i1MVklE.png). Uber support is dead.  Just look at the reviews in App store and Play store reviews from customers of the Uber apps, they will say support was of no help, or something similar. This used to happen to me all the time back when I was taking uber to and from work. And with Ubereats as well. They'd just take my food and keep it for themselves. 

It is possible to get in contact with a person, it's just incredibly difficult. Uber is really good about giving you a refund when you dispute the charge though. 

I think the independent drivers need more of a punishment for pulling this shit off though. Report the trip to Uber and explain it to them. They will refund the ride. They can't do anything about you being late.    


Hopefully there's not a next time, but if there is don't wait 30 minutes before ending / canceling and call another driver. You can drag the pin point gps icon to where exactly you need to be picked upon, never use default location. , and always share your gps with the driver so they know where you are .

In this situation , you can go to your app and go to help and trip issue/adjustment , and explain .. usually take about a day or two, if failed then go to the hub 

When the driver picked you up, your uber app should shown that ride is in progress, at any time there’s an option to say that you aren’t picked up , wrong rider picked up , driver isn’t here, wrong driver etc , plenty of option to choose cancelation rides call 1800-593-7069 Dispute the charge. You can do this most easily by logging in to your web based Uber account (select sign in as rider). Select the trip and dispute. Explain exactly what happened. 

The worst that should have happened is the driver shows up and can’t find you. He waits 5minutes and has the option to cancel the ride for no-show.  You would then be assessed a cancellation fee (rarely more than $5). But that shouldn’t be the case either if you really were at the pickup point. 

The fact that the driver began the ride and drove and ended the ride is not just an asshole move it’s fraudulent. They were probably disgruntled about something regarding the ride but misplaced that anger. 

Report it. "" Dispute the charge on your card/account. Uber support is abysmal. I just had to coment in this one.  My karma  will probably  go down but oh well...here goes...the driver was a dick, no doubt. He should be deactivated.. but now here is the thing.. you should have been curbside waiting..not in your bathroom Putting your last bit of makeup on.. the point is ,once you open the app be ready.. people forget that they got to drive to you for free. And once they accept  your ride they cant get another one. So if your not there, your wasting his/her time.. they're being paid $0.60 per mile so you can expect more of this Uber sucks
 Use Lyft.  Dispute the charge. These companies works with little support because refunding with no major complains is more profitable for them than to afford human workers to solve them, so even if you may think you don't deserve all of your money back, sit back, relax and wait for the refund. It may not look like it, but Uber also wins in this model bussiness: refunding $15 vs paying a minimun salary for somebody. Regards!"

==>what can i do to get that guy caught and, let's not forget, get (at least a part of) my money back?

EDIT: I appreciate the moral lessons that some are giving below but I don't need you guys too teach me about morals or respect.
I  don't need to get told that you shouldn't throw up in nobody else car and understand how bad it is for that guy. I simply didn't anticipate this to happen for two simples reasons: -I don't use uber 
-on the moment my main concern was how to bring my friend to his place safely. Had I thought about it, I would have made him throw up before geting in the car.

Now even if you pretend to be a perfectly moral person who always consider the results of his actions on other before doing anything, it's still not a reason to defend a scammer. Especially as this guy already has legal means to get repaid for the casualties.

What I ask you to focus on is the fact that this guy's behavior wasn't very respectful either and, unlike mine, very illegal. This is what I need help for.","Your friend threw up in a guys car.  Collect the money back from him.  The driver has to clean up that gross shit.  You should of gave him the 200. Nothing. He successfully scammed you for a small amount. He should've taken the cash and hit you on uber given how horrible your behavior was.

Your friend owes you the money. Doesn't matter at all that it wasn't you that puked. You called the ride. Why is the Uber supposed to be responsible to clean up your buddy's puke?     

I get that it sucks. Maybe don't get so drunk you throw up in a strangers car. I'm so glad you're not in my area. You woke up and realized he still reported it to uber and you got charged 150 + 200. That's getting scammed dummy There's nothing you can do. If he threw up, which he did, then he was in the right. Just think of the extra 100 as an extra tip because that was probably the last ride he was able to do Hey, my friend just threw up in your car. Please clean it up. Sorry, it's not really my problem if you lose time/money by having to stop working to clean up a strangers vomit, i'd just appreciate it if you didn't charge me.

So why 4 star a driver?,28,57.000569978019705,uber,"It doesn’t make any sense and I’m down to 4.90 with about 85 5 stars and 7 4 stars, and one 3 (due to a very irate and nasty woman) I don’t want to lose Uber pro and really don’t understand why people give 4s. Seems to me that it would be more beneficial to just have a thumbs up or down system. As everyone that gets in my car compliments it’s nice, I hold conversation with many, and even tolerate unmarked stops. I really just don’t understand why give a driver a 4 unless you expect me to have a fridge in the car or something. Any advice vets?","Well anyone that works in a major corporation has been drilled to follow 3 star= meet expectations, 4 star = exceeds expectations, 5 star = outstanding.  
They will rate drivers in the same way they have been taught corporate ratings work.    

Uber doing something different than the rest of the world will make confusion.  
Everyone else in the world thinks 3 stars is when they meet all expectations/did their job properly.  
This is how every major company in the world does ratings. I give 4 stars for ""forgivable"" but not great experiences. Recently I had a driver who was a bit erratic, clearly frustrated with traffic, and kept slamming on breaks and yelling at other drivers. But hey, I made it to my destination, so 4 stars and still got a tip. 

Another driver took a ""shortcut"" that definitely took a few extra minutes. Otherwise nice. 4 stars. I have a cafe and I feel the same. Some of my reviews go as follows.  

“Amazing cafe. Best coffee and bread I have had in this city. Love the atmosphere and the staff was friendly and helpful.”

3 Stars.  4 stars are for ""average"" service. 5 stars are for exceptional service. This is the view of some privileged people who probably have never really worked in the modern economy, or are unaware of how the world has changed since they were young. They have no idea of how this can change a driver's rating. Only at about 150 to 200 lifetime rides as I do it on the side. But the app never leaves any feedback No idea. They didn't even leave feedback as to why they gave me a 4, so I'm not sure what I did that was ""wrong"".

That being said, I have hundreds of 5-star reviews and 2 4-stars. My rating is a 4.99. I'm kind of glad about it because a 4.99 impresses people much more than a 5.00. Was just talking to my driver about this the other day.  I always start out at 5-staring a driver and work down from there.  I think I've only ever given out a 3 or 4 star once or twice in the years I've been using the service.  I think it's probably just due to lack of knowledge regarding the importance of that rating.  I've seen drivers with the laminated printout on the front seats that explain everything and stress the importance of the stars.  Might be something to possibly look into. I have learned that cheap people are not only cheap with money. They are cheap with their emotions and with giving in general. So they feel that giving 5 stars is too much out of same reason. 

Some people are biased by race, ethnicity, immigration status, etc. 

Some are just ass holes. 

The problem is not the people, the problem is rise sharing companies not educating their pax. 

The bottom line is, Uber and Lyft are loosing by the billions and that explains a lot. I hover between 4.90 and 4.88 and it never drops lower. if it does, you have 3 months to get it above 4.85 before u lose Uber diamond. Drivers worrying about their rating is exactly what Ubers bet was.  This rating system is designed to keep drivers on the road longer when they worry about ratings.  Drivers always want to get ratings back up. Be better."

"For Uber and Lyft Drivers, Camrys Are the Ride Of Choice",25,57.53056997805558,uber,Image,"Used Camrys and Prius in my area are ridiculously high. You can get a used Ford Fusion Hybrid from the same year and same mileage for almost half as much. May not be as reliable, but when you can afford two for the price of one, you have a spare. I thought it was the Prius. Not knocking the Camry - it's nice. But the cargo space is not as flexible and the hybrids stole cargo space from the trunk (except for the current generation). They are slightly more comfortable for passengers, though, and being a Toyota, reliable as heck. Yeah, let's ignore the fact that a Camry is more expensive than say a Corolla and will net you less money in the long run than said Corolla. There is little sense in buying anything but the least expensive and most fuel efficient UberX car. Anyone got a link to the article that is not behind a paywall? > For anyone who likes reliability

Why can't you riders be happy?,2,57.617491274365676,uber,"I know you are not listening to what drivers have to say. But I can tell you how happy your many fellow riders are and how much you are missing out.

Why downvote when happiness is contagious? You can't stop it. Why rate your drivers 4* and below? Just sit back, relax, and you will be there in no time. Even for the most miserable driver, tip them half a gallon of gas and you can have air-con, music and a big smile.

Uber is an experience. It's how you make of it. And then you have a story to tell your kids.

Once upon a time, when Uber was driven by human beings, I met this awesome guy ...

Unaffordable houses in an ultra-conservative neighborhood in an ultra-conservative county that had just fallen. Three or 4 barely legal girls hopped in, one saying goodbye to her mom. The cutest got to sit in front of course. Immediately, I checked what she could be after. No, there's no 5th rider. No, they didn't bring anything unusual. Their outfits couldn't conceal a credit card. Their purses are just enough for a phone.

Soon enough, she wanted to play their own music. Oh, that was easy. I stopped so the car allowed them to hook up to it's bluetooth. The music was in full blast but that's what I do anyway when there's no rider in the car. My earbud will whisper the directions so I don't need to be distracted by the screen.

It was the perfect trip. I got out of my house, drove to the busiest area in town and got paid. The music was right and I gave them a starfighter experience.

Then the skinny girl in the passenger seat started carpool raving all the way. If she hit my dashcam it would have bounced in the car a few times before landing on the floor. If she hit the windshield it could have been broken. But she had control and skills.

They were so hot that they asked to turn up the air-con soon enough. It was already freezing as I last longer in that temperature without feeling sleepy. And they wore a lot less than me.

When her favorite song came up, she would push me around on my shoulder as if I were a dancer on her stage. She would deliver her carpool karaoke lyrics to me face to face, eye to eye. And every other song was her favorite song.

All of a sudden, she glued her face onto my face. If I haven't been so popular, I would have jumped and said WTF. She just wanted to take a selfie with me and post it on IG. No biggie. I suppose I look good with filters on, LOL. Boys do that too but they don't glue to my face. But she did it every 5 minutes as if the last one wasn't good enough. That reminded of my nieces who stopping doing that when they were 10.

That wasn't all. The two paparazzi behind would turn on a selfie spotlight when she was taking pictures, so bright that I thought I was being pulled over by cops. 

Could I still drive? I can drive a starfighter with one arm so she could do whatever to my other shoulder whenever. I can drive fast on the carpool lane at night with all the legal and illegal high-intensity beams shining into my naked eyes. The same for blinding sunlight over the horizon. 

All you have to do is to sample any hints on the lane marker whenever you can, in between blinding beams, as close down or as far ahead as you can, form a mental trajectory and maintain it. If you cannot see the left lane marker, watch out for the right. If you can't see any lane marker, watch afar how the headlight goes so you can expect to bend left or right.

Night driving glasses aren't helping because they reduce the available light. With my naked eyes, I can tell the different shades of black for the concrete barrier and for the road, when there are zero shoulders on an unlit freeway at night. That's how I freak out the car in front and tailgate them out of my way.

So I was driving effortlessly, smoothly, fast and cooperative whatever she wanted to do. Well, I just let her pushed my shoulder around, stared into her eyes when she demanded it and smiled for the camera. And don't worry parents, I know my driving limits and will tell them to stop when they crossed the line.

They were enjoying themselves; whenever they buddies called, they would tell them to FO and call the other phones instead.

They were the perfect candidates to have my number. They were close to where I live and they will be going to where I want on a good fare. But still, I just don't want to disappoint them when I couldn't turn up. I'd rather leave them with happy memories on their phones.  That's forever.",Good post Uh.. cool? 💁‍♂️😁

Thanks in advance guys.","WTF? Is the store a car dealership or medical office? Those are the only places I've heard of that do this. 

I don't see the margin for the store to be big enough to warrant a  $5 ride. At least not without a $100 minimum purchase. the store has a commercial account and will send you a car on request. call store and ask for a pickup."
How do I change my Uber driver rating from bad to good and add tip?,11,58.189019052154485,uber,"I ordered cupcakes from Uber Eats and one cupcake was missing from my order. It was pretty obvious because I ordered 6 cupcakes.


I called the bakery who insisted they put 6 cupcakes in the box. I then rated my Uber driver low and gave them no tip. I also filed a complaint. Thirty minutes later, the bakery called back and said that they realized they only packed 5 cupcakes and took full responsibility. 


How do I change my Uber driver rating and add a tip?


Edit - I filed another complaint saying I was unable to change my driver rating and intended to give the driver a 5 star rating. I was able to adjust the tip on my app.


Edit 2 - Got a response from Uber saying “Though we are unable to adjust the rating to your delivery partner, please know that addressing this issue will not end here. Rest assured that this will be properly documented for internal review.”","This is why i never rate uber eats drivers. Last night i ordered food and it said it was delivered while the driver was on the way. I dont know what caused that to happen. Doesnt mean it was the drivers fault. Try r/ubereats Uber eats only rates thumbs up or down. [deleted] Call support. They might not be able to do anything, but you should try. Maybe order Eats again and hope you get the same driver, tip them like $20 and rate them 5 stars. Order on Uber Eats again around the same time. There’s a good chance that it’s the same driver I think once your a dick..your always a dick"

"Short Analysis of this past weeks high UberEats earnings, I think it is Uber the whole time.",16,58.57600979290351,uber,"There is no secret, I was joking about the secret part.  I believe that it is actually Uber that was adding those extra high tips to keep me hooked on Eats until they eventually reduce and slash my earnings, Uber has been known to lure Eats drivers with high earnings the first few months and then cut them down afterwards.

Here look at this past week,  I got $118.88 just in tips for working 5 days.  [https://imgur.com/a/XSjWyaE](https://imgur.com/a/XSjWyaE)  I was seeing like $6 and $7 and $9 tips very frequently this week.  Almost every customer I delivered to actually tipped at least $3.  Keep in mind the above screenshot is me doing Eats just in evenings on top of my full-time job and only for like 3 to 5 hours a day average.

There was an Eats driver I decided to chat with at one of the restaurants, and I asked him how long has he been driving and he said around 1 year, and then I showed him my screen of all the tip logs, and he said wow I don't get those kinds of tips.  He said ""I only see maybe $3 here and there and maybe just 1 $5 tip during entire shift"".  And this driver is a young white guy who didn't smell or look ugly, and he was dressed clean.  So this made me believe it has to be Uber doing that funny business again.  We all know how Uber used to lose a lot of money to drivers by paying insane high surge from 2012 until 2016 as it grew, and once it found enough passenger drivers, they reduced everyone to low pay and $2.60 rides or $3.40 minimum rides.  Surge is pretty much no more because surge was something Uber allowed for drivers as it grew, surge can never have been sustainable if it actually charged the general public the insane high surge.  In 2015/2016, Lyft used to pay me around $70k a year just doing it part time.  But early 2017 I noticed big crash in my pay, everything went downhill for my pay.  Lyft also lured drivers with insane high pay to get them hooked and addicted.

&#x200B;

I am certain sooner or later I am gonna see the true face of UberEats evil and my pay will crash down.","From a user perspective..   The Uber eats app changes from time to time..  I don't screen shot it to document the changes, but I can say that the tipping got moved up in the ordering process where it gets added..  At least the option to add it..   This may improve user acceptance to tipping?   Or perhaps some people clicking through fast and not recognizing the tip part?   I know that at least one I tipped twice because of not paying attention. Uber hooked drivers in my local market with higher pay and bonuses for the first month; it's that easy. No need to fudge tips (which may be illegal, as a form of tax fraud?) so I don't see why they would try this.

I think you just had a streak of good luck. Hope it keeps up for you, though! I hear you and what I see this as is Uber incentivizing (chumming the water) to ensure enough drivers to fill demand and then they do the same on the customer side with $5 and $10 off coupons and free delivery etc - all to build demand. THis is common in pre - ipo as it inflates the real numbers to levels not normally possible which affects valuation and price per share aka 'the take'.

&#x200B;

I understand that , based on Ubers most recent quarterly report to stockholders, uber eats was the real star of the show - putting up big numbers and showing a profit vs. ubers core business posting a 5 Billion dollar loss (attributed to IPO bonuses and etc for the most part)

&#x200B;

Wonder if they are thinking of spinning off eats. I keep signing up to drive for eats, and Uber never authorizes me.  No idea why. It seems like our Uber Eats in Nashville are almost nonexistent.  I never get many requests any longer That’s why now as a veteran uber driver , I choose the time when it’s worth to go make $$

Only long trips , or 15mins drive at least , or during surge , or weekend night , or events /concerts ending , also bar close , and last but not least airport rides Your show-off, look-at-me posts about your incredible success with uber eats are just pitiful. It's food delivery for gods sake. Not a lot of skill or ambition involved."
"Uber drivers in Portland, OR (or other similar size cities) how much do you make in a month?",7,58.78797738550714,uber,"Thinking of quitting my job which pays about 3000/mo before taxes and doing uber while I search for another job (the current job is unbearable, otherwise I’d just keep doing it til I got a new job). 

What do y’all make on average in a month? Or if that question feels too dependent, what is your average hourly or nightly pay?","you should try ubering out before you quit your job. i drive in Portland and its not super hard to bring in 100+ in a few hours. I'm kind of in the boat youre wanting to put yourself in but i have a wife paying most of the important bills right now. In general, Uber is not great for a full time job. It's good for extra money.     

Asking someone what they make in a gig like this will get you wildly different numbers. I've seen people on my local Facebook pages saying ""tonight sucks and I'm only averaging $7 an hour"" on nights where I'm doing $25-30 with ease.      

My Uber analytics email says I do more rides per hour than 98% of drivers in my city. So if you ask what we make, my numbers are likely to be much higher than the guy who went home. Where will you fall? Who knows. That's why this sort of question is basically useless for a gig job like this. It's a lot of strategy, being out at peak times and some luck. Don’t do it !! Keep ur job , and use uber as extra $$ 

The hours and the wear and tear are more than you think I can tell you that you're not likely to make 3k take home after expenses. You might, but I wouldn't count on it. Uber is not meant to be a full time job, it pays low because it is for ridesharing.  It is just to make a few extra bucks doing a couple rides here or there. So I drive in Portland and ""usually"" take home around $140 after 6 hours of work. Ive met drivers doing 1200-1600 a week but they work rediculous long hours. So the potenial for $4800 a month is there, but you will begin to dread your existence."
Uber charged ME for their cancellations!,18,58.85355608921085,uber,"I was in Brisbane, Australia recently. My sister and I left the Art Gallery and we both called Ubers. My sister's arrived promptly. A couple of minutes leter I got a message that my ride had cancelled. I rebooked. Cancelled again after a few minutes. Wtf? Okay, last time. Book again, cancellation a couple of minutes later. Eventually, I got a friend to pick me up. My cc statement arrived yesterday, Uber has charged me $24 for their 3 cancellations. Any advice here? They've already taken the money.","Your fare was likely 8 bucks. This is a hold on the fare from your cc. It will disappear from your statement in the next day or 2 You request a ride. Uber shows prices. You choose (example) UberX at price displayed at $XX.OO. Request sent out, driver accepts and uber puts a hold on your account for $XX.OO. If you requested 3 times maybe that's what it is. Probably says 'processing' on your bank's page. It falls off. Did they arrive? If you do that in the US and the driver shows up and you don’t get in the car, after 5 mins the driver can cancel and then you are charged $5. 

There are many answers on if this happened or not, but in the US, it’s best to make sure your pickup location is correct, and have an eye out to make sure if you are having a network issue, you won’t miss the driver. 

If they were a ways away, (>.5 miles) and they cancel those charges are probably pre-authorization charges to make sure you have the funds in your account, it only finalists after you get a ride or the driver cancels after 5 mins. Thanks. Sweat it? That's very unlikely. Dispute the charges."

How on earth are we supposed to know with that information? It’s been like that all day, their system is being crap today Also the cash out won’t work with certain debit cards. 

What others said about support.

Don’t expect to get answers from support unless you want another job (contacting support 100x to find one person with half a brain cell). Support is useless - so you won’t be tempted to contact them for any reason. Instant Pay isn't normally available for 72 hours after updating debit card information.

I ain't telling anyone my new secret to getting high tips in UbetEats.,56,59.103961181817226,uber,Image,"You are quick and nice like me? Lol, but seriously...tell me your secret. You f them all don't u?! Nice! My numbers are close to yours, maybe not as many of the $6-7 ones. What’s weird is that it’s only recently (last 3-4 weeks) that I’ve been getting a tip on the vast majority of trips. It comes out to about an extra $2 per trip if I consider the last 100 trips.

Any idea what is causing this? I doubt “tipping culture” has changed lol. The customer app changed to putting the tipping up front, but I thought that was a while ago. I’m in SF.

Edit: a word Here's a hint for people: it's a full moon.     

In other words, two days ago you had no idea why you were getting tips and now you suddenly have secrets for it.     


Or you like attention. I tip well when people follow the insanely easy instructions on my delivery address. 🤷‍♂️ this is no secret!  Uber finally changed the user apps to more prominently display tipping options after completion of orders and rides.  EVERYONE is seeing an increase in TIPS.  Thanks UBER for FINALLY doing something positive for drivers! You provide a free android tablet with each togo order. Tips alone get me $1K a month.  I see $6+ almost every ride. Is it handy-J's or do you go full blowie? I see lots of delivery tips in my app, too. To those who tip: Thank you very much! Verbal vomit swimming in bullshit. 

You need help and I'm quite serious. 

In Minnesota no less.  Get some help. Ok"
I am at my wits end with Uber,3,59.285396367013455,uber,"I have taken a few rides with Uber before, all of them have ran smoothly and the drivers were incredibly professional. Usually, I buy a gift card at the local drug store, add credit, and then get a ride to where I need to be. Not wanting to go into specifics, I am a young adult in a controlling household, so using my debit card (where a trip out of the house would show up on my bank statement) is currently out of the question; as well as telling my parents where I'm going (dog sitting just to make some cash). I have done this numerous times without trouble. However, I recently purchased a 25$ gift card and added it to my account. I went go get a ride using the credit, and it asked me to verify my account using my facebook. My facebook wasn't acceptable. Okay, so I add my debit card. That seemed to work. Until I tried to schedule the ride again- this time it had an error. It's not letting me get a ride with the gift card I put on the account.                         
     
I look to see if they have a costumer service chat or line, and the only number I can find is their emergency number in case a driver gets into an accident. I can only find their help twitter account, so I guess now I have to make a goddamn twitter account just to DM uber's twitter account for some help. I've given Uber my phone number, email address, facebook ( at least I tried), and now my debit card number, and they still won't let me use the gift card I already paid for. What's next, my SSN, thumb print, perhaps a DNA sample would suffice to prove my identity? The absolute gumption of this company to demand all of this information about me like they are the IRS. The money is there- they aren't risking anything if I get a ride.

 I can't even adequately critique their costumer service, because it doesn't exist. Never in my life have I felt so hopeless in getting help, and this is speaking as someone who has called Comcast customer service before. I'm going to use some other app in the future, whether or not this issue gets resolved; in fact, I'll walk the five miles if it means never having to deal with Uber again. All I can say is I'm not surprised that a company that makes you jump through hoops to use their service, get help with their app, and treats their employees like absolute shit is currently losing billions. I really hope my measly $25 that Uber effectively stole from me puts a band aid on the billions that they are losing.

P.S. If you're concerned about the dogs I am dog sitting, I was able to get to them through the help of a trusted friend in exchange for gas money, food, and cute dog pictures.","Hey man, just want to let you know that Uber does have customer service. You can get help either from [help.uber.com](https://help.uber.com), or by tapping the HELP section (Menu > Help) in the Uber app itself. Uber doesn’t sell costumes Yep, the lack of any actual customer service is a major problem with these companies. Instead of customer service they are desperately putting every spare penny into self-driving research in hopes of beating the major players in that field and staying alive. We can only hope uber is utterly crushed when the revolution comes.

Most interesting request for me so far.,10,59.29913479293938,uber,"I had my most interesting Uber Ride Request so far last night. Technically it wasn’t a ride request at all, lol. I got pinged to a location to give a lady a jump because her battery died. She had the cables but no one to give her a jump. I ended up just canceling without charging her since I was in the area anyway and didn’t take but 2-3 minutes, so if I have a chance to make someone’s day with something so small, then why not? I could tell by the look on her face that she appreciative and that was good enough for me.","Unless they changed the app, it would've said unable to end ride due to  lack of distance traveled anyway. I had a guy with a flat and no jack. He requested an XL and when I got there he said he would give me $40 to help change the tire. 

~ 10 mins later had him switched out. Easy $$$ I mean, good for you, but people should stop requesting Uber for things like broken-down vehicles or help moving furniture and stuff. I may be a cold-hearted old man, but I get paid to move people and a reasonable amount of cargo from point A to point B.

There's AAA and other roadside assistance for the former, and hundreds of moving companies for the latter. Yes, they charge more, but that's because THEY'RE CHARGING YOU FOR THE SERVICE YOU REQUESTED. and run the risk of damaging your vehicle in the process. Check your vehicle owner's manual.

AAA Did you at least charge her the cancellation fee? She shouldn't mind if she isn't an asshole"
Threat of 1 star,37,59.39099821887634,uber,"Just for clarification, this did not happen to me but a friend who recently just started Uber

Friend of mine got a ping to pick up a pax. Pax, during the ride from A to B, wanted to make a stop at McDonald's. Normally, he wouldn't mind, except that it was 2AM, the dining room was closed, and the drive thru had about 10 or so cars packed into it. 

Friend tried to reason with pax, saying that it would take a great deal of time to get the food.

Pax then threatened my friend saying that if he didn't go in, he'd leave horrible feedback and a 1 star rating. Friend decided to comply and waited in line for 20-25 mins

Was there anything he could've done about this? In addition to this, the pax did not request an additional stop to McD.","Yikes, that's a shitty situation. If it were me, then I would've kicked the rider out and told them to fuck off. Then I'd 1-star them, report them to Uber for being ""threatening"" and move on. I feel like that if someone is so quick to threaten a driver with a 1-star, then they'd likely 1-star you anyway even if you do what they want. You're better off holding onto your dignity.

With that said, I get that it sucks if you're just starting out. You don't want a 1-star rating to tank your overall rating. Still, the best advice I can give is to not tolerate that kind of disrespect. Shut it down and move on. Take the rating hit and know that most people aren't assholes like that (at least willingly). I think your friend should’ve pulled over and kicked that passenger out immediately. But the bigger issue is that I think drivers need to stop being afraid of a1 star rating. It doest matter. Unless you are exceptionally shitty, you don’t have to worry about getting deactivated. People threaten to report me every single night. I’m still here. If you don’t break laws, aren’t a creep, and get people from A to B safely, your rating does not matter. And if you’re at the point where your concerned about your rating and getting deactivated, you’re doing something else really wrong. 

Point is, not doing McDonald’s runs won’t make your break your rating. I cancel the ride on them and make them leave. Then I call uber and tell them never to pair me with this shit bag again. If this happened shortly after I picked them up I would simply cancel the ride and tell them to exit my vehicle. Sure you won't get paid but they also can't rate you and if you're only a mile into the trip then you aren't hurting too bad. If you do this long enough you'll become more comfortable with a few cancellations for a happy life. I've come across 2 difficult people for 600 rides that I had to cancel, one wanted me to carry 5 and the other one started cussing me out because they took a Pool to work and another pickup got added. lol anytime i would get threatened with a 1 star i would tell them i dont give a shit and laugh Diver here, take the one star and keep them coming. You 1 star them back and report them. Stars hurt them more than us and mine disappear eventually. Be reasonable but if they are not, kick them out or take them to the designated location and drop off. If you expect a driver to wait in a drive thru you better expect to give a decent cash tip, before you enter the line. I don't mean a couple bucks either. You say ""I'm sorry, but it's late and there's already another rider after you queued up and waiting to get picked up. It wouldn't be fair to her to make her wait an extra 20 minutes."" Be me , in Austin Texas 

2 pm bar close , picked up 2 girls , they r drunk ,destination is to their home , 3 miles away , girls want me to stop at burger chain drive thru, I told her I can stop and drop y’all off but I’m def not gonna stay longer than a min, girls says why, told her I’m have to hustle back to downtown to make more surge trip , 

girls says they will tip me good, I said only if it’s in cash tip , girls say will tip $5 on the app, told them no sorry it’s busy time .


At the burger place parking lot , girls exited the car and start yelling and calling me names and profanity , I smile to them and say have a great night ..

Got the 1 Star and feedback and a message from uber , I one star them and go to help and click on issue with rider , and tell them the truth 

So far I have 2000 plus rides, most of them 5 star, 9 of them 4 star , 4 of them 3 star, 2 of them 2 star and 3 of them 1 Star, Uber only rounding up the last 500 trips average star , so I still got 4.95 average , still high

As for the pax, I doubt they took 2000 rides , and with that behaviors and my 1 Star , I’m sure their rating drop to 4.5-7 My rule: you threaten me with a 1 star, the rides over. I'm reporting you as an unsafe Rider and force them to cancel. 

After 7k rides I've never had to do this tho This is why you don't pick up low rated pax.

Trade low ratings. Skip the stop. Move on. Don't pick up low rated pax, your rating will improve. I always tell them, ""This is UBERx not UBER Eats.  NO FOOD IN MY CAR.  I'm dropping you off at your location and then you can order UBER Eats or Waitr or Dominos or whatever the fuck.  You don't like it I'll drop your entitled ass off at the Circle K."" That rider was a serious jackass, the driver should report it to uber, Uber will be able to pull up the trip, see what happened and side with the driver because they have a policy that stops have to be kept 2 minutes or less. 

Giving 1 stars when it isn’t truly deserved is awful. Get a dashcam! I would always reiterate with the passenger that it's too busy of a time to do long stops. I would recommend they use uber eats or give them restaurants in the area that are still delivering at that hour. Happened to me. I told them since I was getting a 1 star anyway then he should leave me car now. He left and I ended the ride. He gave me a 1 star and I went about my day. 

It might happen once to everyone but whatever. Do exactly  what you did...ratings  and all..lol. then afterwards call uber suport  and complain  about them... remeber not to give them a low rating because they can retaliate.... people like this  need to be kicked off the app so, he got $4 for not wasting gas?

They may not want to make such a long trip and it could save you both a lot frustration and wasted time Most drivers wouldn't take it.

Drivers in Houston with no EZ-tag?,5,60.2388917374197,uber,"Had two drivers in a row that didn’t have toll tags.  Luckily these were weekend rides and there wasn’t a ton of traffic...   In Houston you really can’t survive without using toll roads.  

How can I specify that the driver must have a toll tag?  Does Lyft require it drivers to have them?

Thanks","No, there's no way to pick a rideshare driver, the cheapest transportation short of a bus, that has an EZ-tag. Taxi cab From what I have read the passenger pays tolls so why would drivers have them ? You report the driver for deviating from the GPS route against your wishes. That's how you specify that."

Any help or steer would be helpful. I've even gone through their customer service Twitter DM and I cannot get my issue resolved. They've actually stopped responding to me on email lol","Go to a hub,or try lyft.Sad,but true. What issue are you having? Any resolution to this? Have pretty much the same issue. As I am learning, I am not surprised of your result. My experience the last 24 hours is like many others over the years. Like others, the “e-mail support” leads to no progress. The responses from Uber don’t even take into consideration what the presenting issue is.  

I’m going to try to go to a Uber Greenlight hub in the near future, which is sorta-near me. It’s abhorrent that a company the size of Uber would require such from its customer, when having competent remote support is feasible and would be the appropriate and reasonable avenue to fix the issue."
Uber Research Opportunity!,5,60.511738959663994,uber,"Hey guys! I’m a student researcher at Carnegie Mellon University. My research team and I are doing a study on algorithms and how they affect people's jobs. I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while (this is a throwaway account btw), and I've noticed a lot of people complaining about Uber's current algorithm and how it screws them over. We're doing research on how we could improve this algorithm, but we need more context from drivers before we can go further in our study.

If you have anything you wanna get off your chest about Uber or want to know more about this study, shoot me a DM! If you're also interested in an hour-long interview, also lmk! We can give $13 gift cards to compensate for these hour-long interviews, though spots can be limited. Would be a HUGE plus if you're already in the Pittsburgh area. Any response will help though!

Not today, Satan. I’m happy to help with your research! Some drivers in some markets feel like Uber's algorithm treats them well.  Especially with the recent introduction of Uber Pro, where the gold and above tiers tell us how long the ride will be before we accept it.  I guess it all depends on expectations.

What happens to my Uber credit card if Uber ever goes bankrupt or dies off?,25,60.61346349671483,uber,The Uber card is my first credit card and I have been developing my credit score with it.,"You literally die Uber is just the brand license. The actual banking and credit card services are through Barclay's - at least here in the US it is. If the bank went under, they would go into receivership and you would continue making your payments until they sold it off to another bank and they take it over.

&#x200B;

 [https://www.barclaycardus.com/apply/action/handleFile?id=ubrFaqForwardUrl](https://www.barclaycardus.com/apply/action/handleFile?id=ubrFaqForwardUrl) Usually they get bought by another company and you get a new card. Nothing else really changes and you still owe the debt. It's administered by Barclays, so the name of the account may change or it may be shut down if the contractual terms demanded it. Since it is a visa/mc and not a ""store"" card, it will likely continue in one form or another as another type of card product. It ultimately depends on the card agreement that Uber reached with Barclays and if it restricts how accounts are transferred. 

Uber is unlikely to die off completely. It is likely to significantly change over time, becoming more expensive as they cut loss-making lines of business etc. The almost 6 billion loss reported was mostly accounting for IPO share conversions and not actual cash loss (which was less then 2 billion). Uber has very deep pockets. They are unlikely to go bankrupt even as they continue to lose money in the next couple years. Beyond that who even knows? You are nuts if you don't think you'll be getting picked up by an uber robot in a few years"

RANT: Uber drivers have entitlement issues,25,61.11830145968883,uber,"Throwaway bc I know I'm gonna disturb someone's sensitivities. 

Also I'm on mobile and angry. Sorry.

Look. I completely understand that driving for Uber is for the most part some people's livelihoods so I always give five-star ratings and a tip if I can for a ride. I always strive to be courteous and say good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and drive safe etc. But during my last ride as soon as my Uber picked me up we had an issue. Long story short my location wasn't being shared accurately so I messaged him the location that I was at. And when he picked me up he was very pissed off and said you know you don't have to text me your location I could see it on the app I'm not stupid. I didn't say anything I just got in the car and put my headphones in and then when I got to my location and I got out I told him drive safe like I normally do and he said yeah like you give a f*** about my day. So I slammed the door and kept walking and gave him one star and no tip. When I got into work I told my co-workers the story and they all said yeah recently I've had some Uber drivers be rude for no reason but I still give them 5 stars because you never know what someone is going through and I said screw that we're paying them for a service and there is no excuse for being rude for no reason. I get that some of you Uber drivers get horrible passengers but don't f****** take that out on passengers who mean well. If you hate driving people around then don't f****** do it and just get a real job. I'm sick and tired of people in customer service who obviously hate their job. Just do us all a favor and quit. 

Rant over :)","I don't drive often anymore because I was getting frustrated with how much I was making and dealing with entitled passengers. He should've kept his mouth shut and he would've had 5 stars and a tip. Unfortunately, it will get worse. 

""In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase."" - Uber Yes, your 1 bad experience means Uber drivers have entitlement issues.    

Or it could be that you met a douche who happened to be an Uber driver and every job is filled with some good people and some douches. Also possible. Do you wanna know why you've been getting more and more asshole and entitled drivers I'll tell you why!

 It's all these piece of shit customers who report good drivers to Uber and Lyft for being under the influence, false accusations of sexual harassment or unsafe driving to get a free ride that disables the good drivers so that only leaves you with the bottom of the barrel! Congratulations assholed passengers you created this world.

FWIW I don't believe OP is one of these im just on my own rant here. [deleted] "" location wasn't being shared accurately ""

Why not just type in pick up

reading texts while driving is hazardous. Lol. Don’t like it, don’t use it. There is plenty of options out there public transport, taxi, your own damn car. If you CHOSE to use a service then bitch about people not treating you right then don’t use it, and don’t paint yourself like a saint. As a driver I don’t give a fuck about stars, if some one is being mean or just plain nasty that person deserves a low rating. Leave that  “oh some one might be having a bad day” bullshit. Because when you work for a service nobody gives two shits about your bad day, just try to act like a grown up and deal with it."

How do I escalate an issue I have with Uber?,10,61.44525747822943,uber,"Anyone know a way I can escalate an issue with Uber? Essentially, it's a dispute over a refund.

I confirmed a ride for $17.75. Driver took another route resulting in additional charge of $24.38. After having them look into the issue, they indicated they'll refund $24.38. Which they did AND reversed the $17.75. Then charged me for the full amount of $42.13 (which is the sum of $17.75 + $24.38). So, in the end, they didn't refund $24.38.

I've attached a screen shot of my bank transactions showing this - multiple times. Are they extremely incompetent or just don't know basic debit and credit?

If there isn't an escalation point, would Consumer Affairs be another route? Any suggestions?

Really frustrated.","Maybe they lost $5.2B by refunding people lol and they decided they will just charge people double the fare from now on and pretend they're actually doing a refund. Visit a Greenlight Hub for in person support, much better than virtual. Did the $42.13 already clear or was it still authorizing? It may be a pre-auth which goes away after a few days. If not, Greenlight Hub. Def some shady practices going on at Uber.  Maybe people should start a class action lawsuit and multiple BBB complaints.

Uber never refunded me,3,61.90510701526646,uber,"Just wondering if someone else had a problem like this.

One night I tried to request a ride, and the Uber app told me there were no drivers around, but I still requested the ride (then for $8.10) in case a driver would log in a while after I requested it.  
The request expired but I was still charged with the $8.10. Minutes later I saw there were drivers available, but now the price was $18.72, I requested the ride, and the driver who accepted it was not moving for a few minutes, so I cancelled it. Then I requested another ride, this time for $18.93, and the woman who accepted it had taken me before, I hated her, so I cancelled. After that I just downloaded Lyft... but, anyways, every time I requested a ride I opened my bank account app and saw my money go down every time I just requested a ride. It has been a week and I don't have my $45.75 back. I tried contacting Uber and they just said that ''sometimes a family member may request a ride using your card information'' which is not true, since I live alone, I am the only one who uses Uber, and only I have access to my account. I explained that to them, and then they asked me to send a screenshot of the charges in my bank account, which I did, and they just said again to send a screenshot, which I did a second time. They asked again for a screenshot, and I sent it again, and then they asked again for the screenshot. I got upset and just deleted the app. I am not expecting my money back, just wondering if this has happened to someone else.","Uber is loosing to much money, your post doesn't surprise me. This makes sense that they charge you immediately after you request the ride. They don’t want you paying after the fact there’s too many sketchy people out there, they have to make sure you have sufficient funds before you ride so you don’t go requesting rides on visa gift cards with 30 cents on them.
That said, it shouldn’t take a week for that money to go back into your bank account, that part is ludicrous, but not too shocking. File a BBB complaint as you explore other solutions."

"Uber lost over $5 billion in one quarter, but don’t worry, it gets worse",7,61.9631625708441,uber,Image,"Most of the loss was one time charges from the IPO. Not really informative.

Slowed growth is concerning, but let's not pretend it's all doom and gloom. Stock barely moved since earnings. I did a pool that chained 6 people during surge time, got $45 total for it. I was curious about how much Uber made on this, and it turned out they had like $16 in service fees and their cut of my fare, but they ended up somehow discounting $17, so for me transporting 6 people - they somehow lost $0.30.

&#x200B;

It sounds like the strategy is to make it up on volume, but if the volume doesn't add up to any revenue for them, they might run out of time.

&#x200B;

There was a crazy surge going in my area, and all that pushed people to do was do a pool, which seems to lose them money. Uber is announcing mile and time rates cut by %20 country wide but they now give you $.13 for accepting a ride and a $.7 pickup fee on ALL pickups Is this why they are reaping off riders?"
I've taken Uber twice. Both times they gave me a personal card.,18,62.22481766343669,uber,"Offered me rides for less than Uber would if I called them personally. Do you guys do that too? 

UBER is making a little bit of a comeback but I don't think UBER is going to make any money in the near term. Opinions?","I hate when they do this. Like dude I'm not going to go through the additional hassle of scheduling with you. If u take personal card rides, you have no insurance , and if something happens it will be between both of you..

That being said, there are legitimate chauffeur services that they have to registered as and have a personal cc machine that you can swipe.. this lead to personalized driver that went to extensive background check and car maintenance.. it also makes them available 24/7 usually at higher rates than uber x but still comparable to taxi services .. they are allowed to pick u at airport terminal instead of drop off/pick up point ..
But a lot of them are gypsy taxi and very illegal thing todo ,

You can report them if they don’t have chauffeur license , since they are the ones who usually skimmed the Cc number and scam uber riders Unless you frequently order super long rides then it's kinda pointless for the driver to want to work off the grid. 

I've had pax request my services on the side and I always decline because even as a driver it's usually not worth it. They paid $12 for the ride and I got $7, but am I really going to roll out of bed, or kill my netflix show, or whatever it is I'm doing and come flying across town for an extra 5 bucks? Probably not. Maybe if I had some consistency to my schedule, such as *always* starting my shift in a certain area of town and knowing that you are *always* ordering a long ride at that time of day so it just works out for me..... However the driver gets paid, it's in the same order of magnitude as Uber. So scheduling is a huge problem; drivers cannot ignore Uber rides and give up everything to ""personal"" rides, whatever it means.

I have people who want me to pick them up later at bar close. I remember people who leave work at 9 pm, 10, 12, 2am but no matter how I would like to give them preferential treatment, I just don't have the chance to drive to the same area because I'm busy.

The only thing that may work is 30+ mile airport trip scheduled.

I'm thinking of giving out cards for people who may have difficulty finding a ride at odd hours, if they are cute. On my way home, I picked up people returning home at 3:30, 4 am who shouldn't be traveling alone. If they call me I can drive over so at least they can request a Uber ride. Anything else we can talk about it when I will be there. I'm going home anyway so I have nothing to lose.

One of my Uber riders offers me cash to drive whenever he goes to town to party. I charged him $60 round trip but that's not enough. For the return trip, it's 30 min travel time but I have to spend 30 minutes max to get to him and another 30 minutes to return to where I was.

I can ask for more but it's not all about money. He splits with 4 friends so it's not a big deal for them. But you may get Uber rejects. The first trips are great. I start work and pick him up. And I drive him back on Sunday when I go home early.

Then they bring beer to the car and ask if they can drink. And they bring their unfinished bottle into the car when they leave the bar. I didn't check or notice because who are stupid enough to break the law like that and I have to pay? Plenty of cops around during bar closing.

They offer me dinner and late-night snacks and drinks (coke) too. I hate it because the food and drinks are good but I am losing money sitting down. I accepted because I have to wait in the car anyway. At first, they know to get take out. But then they think that free food can compensate for that. No.

The straw is that they spill and leave empty cans behind. So disrespect when I have to clean up after. 

I rather deal with Uber pax; I can kick them out immediately if I don't liek them.

Breaking up is going to be ugly. They invited me home but I never tell them where I live. I haven't seen this since Uber started up in my area.  I know the legality of it in the case of an accident is far different than if he had been on the clock, but I guess it never hurts to know a good jitney.

&#x200B;

The one personal card I received I never used until about half a year later.  I had the guy added in my phone and someone in my family needed a reliable pickup at the airport at midnight.  Uber was crazy expensive so I called up the guy.  He had quit driving for uber months prior but agreed to it.  I didn't even pay him until he dropped her off. That goes directly against terms and conditions.  If they get reported, they will be deplatformed; which isn’t a terrible thing given the over saturated market Uber has created."
I need to take my cat to the vet (in a carrier). Which is better for the driver when asking for permission: texting or calling?,23,62.332757478262536,uber,I just want to make things as polite and as easy as possible,"Text Can't speak for everyone else, but I can't read a text while driving. Text For me, a text. When I take or make calls in the app, it jacks with how things come through my car's audio system (stupid Car Play) and I have to restart my phone to get it to stop. However, I'd have to turn down the ride as I'm very allergic to cats. So I'd totally appreciate the head's up. Text always. As a driver...neither. If your pet is in a carrier there shouldn't be an issue at all. Calling a driver is hateful. Thanks for asking! I travel with my cat a lot. I always text ahead of time. 99% of the time it's OK. A couple of days ago, the driver never responded--he just drove in the other direction. I eventually had to cancel the ride. (I was not charged a fee.) Text but either is fine Text is preferable. What if the driver is allergic to cats? Fuck the driver just bring the pet"
Tonight a passenger tipped me with a whole pizza.,19,62.84212090418846,uber,"I picked this lady up from a hospital. She didn't look like a patient, but she did look very tired, and maybe a little sad.   She was dressed normally and holding a pizza box. It was a short, quiet ride. 

I pulled up to her house and she asked ""Would you like some pizza?"" I hesitated at first because I thought she was just going to hand me a slice, and I didn't have anywhere to eat it. But fuck it, I accepted the offer. And she just handed me the box and got out. 

What are some things other than cash passengers have given you?","Had a passenger tip me with two free pretzels. Another asked to stop at the drive thru and offered me food but I turned it down. That was the day I learned to always accept food, because they're not gonna tip me with actual money I own a cafe/bakery and often give people pastries. Often times if drivers are taking me to the cafe I offer one to them and either run them out something they want or they park for a second and come inside. 

It’s always a good interaction. Once I was 'tipped' an air balloon ride for two, so I brought my gf at the time the very next day. It was very cool, still facebook friends with that British lady. 

I also got a huge bottle of vodka once. I had a passenger offer me weed once.  I had to decline, though.

Food was pretty common when I first started driving and was still willing to do drive thrus.  Most passengers would offer to buy me something too. Had a group of girls tip with a wine cooler. Told em I couldn't drink it on the job but they insisted I take it anyway so I put it in the trunk.    

The coolest I think was the manager of a local wings place. He forgot to leave the keys to whoever had to close that night so I turned around so he could leave them the keys. He tipped me with a $10 gift card to the wings place. That's what I had for dinner that night. Awesome! The other night I got a mango and weed... fuckin Hawaii I have this guy , a little drunk, said he want to try good burger, took him to whataburger , and he insisted I eat with him , I was hungry so that’s what I did I've had a few, but the silliest so far is probably a couple guys I took to the gas station. They wanted a return trip, and I asked them to do it in the app, but they couldn't figure out how to make that work, so they asked how much cash they'd have to give to get me to do it. Considering my current location and the time of night, I told them at least $5 since it was only a mile or so. So I got to the gas station and waited for one guy to do the shopping while chatting with the other in the car.

The guy shopping asked me if I wanted anything before I went in, and I told him maybe a coconut water like the one I was almost finished with. Apparently he wanted to pay in cash, but the smallest bill he had was $100. At this point in the story, I was worried something that size wouldn't be accepted, but fortunately the gas station operator was rational and wanted money. Unfortunately, he didn't have enough change for a hundred, so my passenger decided to just buy more things to cover the difference.

He ended up getting me a coconut Red Bull because it was the closest they had. When I told them I'd never even had a Red Bull before (true), they told me I needed to try some of their local energy drinks which were healthier or something. (In Denver/Boulder, a claim like this doesn't surprise me.) He also got each of the three of us a scratch-off lottery ticket. To top it off, they ran a food truck, and they gave me a small fruit crumble that they had extra from earlier in the day.

Final tip: a Red Bull, three off-brand energy drinks, a lottery ticket, a fruit crumble (delicious), and $10 cash. To think some of the more outspoken people here would say I should have ditched them. I still need to scratch off that ticket. I've been tipped a whole to-go box full of chicken wings from a local bar. They were pretty good lol. Other than that I've been tipped a can of beer, a $10 Firehouse gift card, some weed and multiple invites to the parties I drop people off at. I usually decline the invites tho. You never know how crazy it could get, especially if it's a woman inviting you. No offense ladies lol Some passengers tipped me a few roses, someone gave me a package of bacon (yes!), someone gave me two tickets to a hockey game, and one other person gave me a cool necklace. In Nor Cal I get tipped weed quite often usually just a couple of buds. One guy gave me a hit of acid. My LSD days are behind me but I was tempted to take it. People regularly give me food if they want a stop. A blunt on my bday, which I will not confirm or deny later use of. Good if I'm willing to stop. [deleted]"

Uber Ratings based on race?,11,63.10331303383189,uber,"So basically as a black man i think i got lower ratings or no ratings at all because of my race.

The other day i picked up this white girl (uber ride, not a prostitute) 

She was drunk with her friend. I don’t mind drunk people cause i rather deal with them than them killing innocent black people(89% black population) 

she and her friend started engaging in hood rat activities and taking snaps and blasting music on my Farenheit TID-702NR car stereo then started harassing me and i didn’t budge cause i was driving in a busy area and didn’t want to hit any innocent black folks. 

Then they spilled their bubble tea cups on my back seats (that drink is hard to get off and smelled bad) i tried to be nice and let it pass. 

Then one of them kept asking for tampons, i am a happily married man to my black wife and she always keeps some in the car in case of emergencies.

I got her two and she thanked me for it. 

We finally reached the destination. They said their goodbyes and all. Then i grabbed my towel from my trunk to clean the bubble tea.

Went inside and found one of the tampons used and literally there on the back seat(it smelled bad so she must have a yeast infection or something, not surprising since shes white) 

Then i turn on my Lexus lights and i see a ton of blood on my white seats (without any covers cause my beautiful black daughter was washing them and i didn’t really expect anyone to bleed on the seats) 

On top of it. I was really pissed off but what pissed me the most is that they gave me 2 stars???

"Uber Wants to Sell You Train Tickets. And Be Your Bus Service, Too.",5,63.31664636717627,uber,Image,"Everyone keeps saying that Uber's end game is all about driverless taxis.  It's not. 

Uber's overall mission statement is to become the world's most dominant player for all methods of transport and have all those methods seamlessly integrated.

The real end game is that whether you need a quick ride from home to work or you need a multi stage journey from home in the US to a vacation spot in Spain, it will all be provided by Uber. It’s smart. Bus service is just a disgrace in this country for the most part (and it’s not like it’s cheap!). 

It’s more cost effective to give everyone Uberpool unless the bus is running through a very populated area. As part of a regional transit service it makes a LOT of sense. Uber motto: Why do one thing well when you can suck at a hundred. 

Uber needs to out of business already."
A question to Chicagoland Rideshare drivers. (Hollywood Casino Amphitheater In Tinley Park),6,63.420095441261374,uber,"Headed to a show at Hollywood Casino Amphitheater in Tinley Park Il this Saturday evening. And have a question or two about their process there. 

I’ve rode ride share after big events and I’m aware that getting some distance from the venue is a great idea before requesting a ride share. 

Do any drivers on here prefer a pick up spot. I was thinking a parking lot for a nearby location such as the country club there or Odyssey Fun world? Any input from a driver or two. 

Also they have an “Uber Lot” is that going to be a waste of time for me ???

From the looks of it the show isn’t selling to well so that might also factor. 

Not opposed to hiking to get a ride share. Any input would be much appreciated. Thanks for any and all replies. Have a great day.","If the Uber lot is inside the parking lot, it’s a mess. You’ll be sitting there for quite a while. Oddessy is a good place, traffic really doesn’t back up that far, and the lot is *HUGE*! That’s honestly the best place to go. If you walk over to Target and all those shops and crap, it takes forever to get there because the cops block of streets at random it seems. 

Btw, who’s playing? I'm curious to know what you ended up doing and how it worked out. I have the same question for a show this Thursday. I'm debating whether to Zipcar or ride-hail."
Anyone notice it takes longer to get an Uber?,6,63.64105608940952,uber,I'm an Uber Rider and I have a 5 star rating in Chicago. Usually it only takes 2 mins to get a ride but lately it's taken 5 to 12 mins. Anyone else have this problem?,"So what you’re saying is in a volatile circumstance with both the amount of drivers and the amount of riders  fluctuating at all times and without a launch location as another example of the endless variables involved you are getting varied results with use? In Chicago as well, avg pickup time under 4 minutes in central areas. I'm not sure if you're being entitled, being unrealistic, being stupid, being a combination of the above or being something else. Drivers sometimes don't like perfect 5.0 stars because passengers are new or not familiar with the app. There's a high chance of a passenger being at the wrong location or making the driver wait such as chauffeur service"
I was in one of those frustrating situations where I got stuck with a 140 mile one way fare.,52,63.64332460794184,uber,"I finished working my full time job in Philly at 4PM and immediately turned on my Uber app to start driving.  I usually do 2-3 hours after my full time job daily just to bring in a few extra bucks each week.  Yesterday though I got myself in a situation I was not very excited to be in.  It was getting to be close to the end of my shift so I put in my home destination which is about 20 miles west of Philadelphia, near Malvern, PA.  I ended up getting a ping and drove to the Philly airport to pick up my passenger.  I help him put a bunch of luggage into my trunk and start the ride.  It wasn't until we we're both settled in that I now notice his destination.  Washington, DC.  My jaw drops, and I am starting to get pissed that I feel obligated to drive this guy to DC.  I wouldn't mind canceling trips in this situation except for the fact that I only work 8-10 hours a week as it is, so one canceled trip can really harm me with such a low ration as it is.  

I really wish there was a better way to handle these situations, and have a driver notified well before they pick up a rider when it comes to long trips like this.

In the end I did end up taking him, and was thrilled with my passenger as he was friendly, and a great passenger.  He also ended up tipping me $100 which really ended up making the drive back worthwhile.  I still feel like Uber under pays for ultra-long trips like this, seeing as the 3 hour drive home was all wasted time in which I did pick up 3 other fares ranging in 8-15 mins each, but each one of those fares required me to get off the highway, and then back on the highway.  None of those fares really were towards my ""destination""  They just ended up costing me more time and fuel.

At $0.67/mile and $0.21/min, I made $119.40 which for a 5.5 hour round trip comes out to a little less then $20/hr, which really isn't that bad.  BUT it also cost me a full $50 tank of gas, 306 miles on my car.  Even with that nice tip, between gas and wear and tear on my vehicle for this trip, it was a total loss of money.  Wear and tear estimates range from $0.30/mile up to $1.00/mile or more depending on vehicle cost, yearly miles and LOTs of other factors, but even at $0.30/mile, your talking about a cost to drive of $0.30 x 306 = $91.80 + $50 gas = $141.80, I.E. much more then Uber paid me for the drive.  So with out that guy extreme generosity, I would have lost a significant amount of money for this trip.

TLDR:  Drove passenger 306 miles from Philly airport to DC.  Lost a significant amount of money even with a $100 tip.  Be very cautious with very long trips that take you away from your ""work zone.""","Uber is a platform that allows people to convert their car’s depreciation into immediate cash. This math is not at all surprising, but the vast majority of drivers won’t take the time to think this way. [deleted] There are notices when you are picking up the passenger for long trips 45 min + but nothing else. Next time turn it down. When the passenger gets in, and you swipe to start the trip, you see the destination.

Simply say something like, I'm sorry but I can't leave the metro right now. And the trip without moving, it's a cancellation with no charge to the customer.

This is 100% your decision. So you made $220 in less than 6 hours and you're complaining?

Got it. I prefer long trips , but 5.5 hours is too long lol Starting in 2003 I worked in taxis and limousines through to about 2011.

I also did a little dispatching. At that time it was common practice if I was going to send a driver a 100 or 200 or 300 miles out I would try to get him some kind of ride for the way back.

I worked with one dispatcher who got a percent of what he booked. He was great when ever you had a long trip he bent over backwards to get you something on the way back.

This is better for the driver and more efficient use of the taxi companies vehicles. Unfortunately it seems that Uber and Lyftt don't function in this manner and the randomness brings about inefficiencies into the system.

Hey OP,  One time when I was driving limos (2010ish) I got a ride from the FDA right outside of Washington DC up to New Jersey the customer paid $550. I received 51% of that. Company issued vehicle and the company paid for gas.

 Boy things have changed. 50 bucks for a tank, what in the world do you drive? I pay 30 bucks for a tank at most. I did trips like this all the time when I was driving. I made out like a bandit with my  car (50mpg at 65mph on the interstate) I drive a diesel VW Jetta Sportwagen with a manual transmission.

I honestly really, really loved driving rideshare and wish Uber would take me back. My heart still skips everytime I see the Uber windshield sign. Brings back a lot of good memories of conversations and adventures with strangers.

I was kicked off of both Uber and Lyft due to an issue with my background check that I have no idea how to fix... both respond with scripted messages now when I try to resolve it... :(

My only source of income now is my job as a street sweeper. Sucks during slow (rainy season) or a lull in business as I have no backup gig. So I drive down in Delaware. I took a passenger from Ocean City to BWI, about 120 mins one way, for $165 ish.
I think PA pays shit. That might be why. 
The whole Uber Pro is still in beta mode, at least for me here. You have to earn 300 points quarterly. > I wouldn't mind canceling trips in this situation except for the fact that I only work 8-10 hours a week as it is, so one canceled trip can really harm me with such a low ration as it is.

Can really harm you eh? Exactly what numbers are you basing this upon? The guy may have been nice and everything but he's still an ass for not calling you and giving you a chance to cancel or explain why you can't do that for him at the moment.  I also try to carry a little bit of cash if the ride is super short but was still not within walking distance.  I'm sure it sucks to drive 15 minutes to someone for a 10-minute drive. Screw that I don’t ever take the 45+ minute pings this is why. Stop crying little girl
..I live for and love long trips like these. Wow.  I'm gonna try and remember to really check destination before I start moving from now on.  Thanks for the cautionary tale.  Sorry you had to go through the aggravation."

Why on-demand ride-hailing still considered sustainable business?,19,64.69663479315737,uber,Image,"You need to understand economy and business and also how tax works .... also credit and financing

Uber and lyft are making $ , but they keep buying assets , running expensive researches and paying fat $$ salary to its exec.. hence the loss of profit ...

They will continue to do this until all the research and autonomous car are permitted in the street , and it’ll be like printing $ for them ..


A lot of business do this , because they know they will make $ and so they spend the $ before hand so they can claim profit loss and not pay tax ..


To simplify : 

I open foodtruck, cost $10000

I sell food , cost $10/box

Each year I sold 36500 box, totaling $365000

Cost to run and expenses $200000

So $365000-$200000-$10000=155000

Net profit =$155000

If I claim like this , I would have to pay tax on $155000
So instead I buy 15 more foodtruck and hire more people and pay them fat $$ , in this case using credit and investor so I will be run on negative balance the next year and hence no tax needed to pay or any other misc Uber making money , but their expenses on salary and bonuses and research for their autonomous car fleet are enormous that it covered it all 

Let me check for their report and link it to this thread Uber/lyft  best move now is to float for a couple more years , while they are cornering the market around the globe , including their competition in china or many other countries ... 

I can’t speak for their ceo thinking / plan for the future 

But if it’s me I will :

Float for the next 5 years , making minor change in the algorithm, incentives , airport setup/ making pick up/drop off point at all major event center / hotels

Within 5-10 years  taxi should be at the brink of collapse since more and more people will stop using them and move to uber/lyft/rideshare

5-10 years ... you should see more and more uber/lyft Driver’s carrying advertisement tablet/monitors in their car , Uber will corner this market and become a major ad agency 

10-20 years in some cities , autonomous car ride share should be operational and being offered to consumer , this is the crucial time for ride-sharing company to solidify their presence in the market by buying space for pick up/drop off and replace taxi completely

20-25 years , most uber/lyft will be autonomous and most people will not be driving their car anymore 

30years time ... for each transportation request uber will be basically printing $$ Deficit is not the same as loss. You see the same shallow logic everywhere you look on this topic. (That's what you get when journalism gets replaced by clickbait)

Rideshare is only new ground because their property is almost all both (1) intellectual and also (2) not really come to fruition. What they have to stand on in the meantime is their platform & revenues.

Revenue streams are valuable even if they're being run at a deficit. The quality now will be up to the drivers 

In the future , it should be like automated elevator And that’s why their expenses ballooned up every year how is babby formed?"

Charged $220 cancellation fee for a trip cancelled by the driver??,6,64.9973523857748,uber,"On Saturday night I called an Uber to take me home from a concert. I had someone accept, then shortly after cancel. Whatever, that happens. Got a ride soon and made it home. 

Just got an email tonight saying Uber “corrected” the fare for my cancelled trip... from $0 to $219.58. And that amount is sitting as a pending charge in my bank account. 

So what the fuck? When I click on “dispute cancelation fee” in help, it tells me the fee has already been adjusted... and there’s no other way to contact support that I can find. 

Am I going to just have to dispute this and get a new card? If so, I’m pissed. 

Thanks","It will probably fall off of your pending charges in another day or 2 Something is missing in your story, if it was a cancellation you should get a $5 fee to cancel. If there was a rebill of a trip canceled mid-ride, there will be a receipt emailed to you showing a route. If it was a damage fee, there should be an email with a couple of pictures. It sometimes will put a hold on a card for the expected amount of the ride. But that doesn't stay on the card. 

One other thing, your not looking for an adjustment, you have a billing dispute. If you never got into the ride, or didn't see the driver, you want something that says something like I don't take this trip. An adjustment is for taking a trip that was 5miles, and then the driver left the ride open and ended up driving 5 more miles. Use a different support query. Something random, doesn't even matter. Just needs a text box. Then ask WTF is wrong with that fare that you were charged that much. Yes, dispute the charge. No, I don't see why you'd need to get a new card."
Who should be afraid of stars?,16,65.2052574783674,uber,"Drivers erase any stars in 500 ratings (sorry, not rides); 500 rides can be had in a few weeks and less than 2 months even for working part-time. And they need 18 1-stars to start worrying their Uber Pro status, getting pennies for a tank of gas.

If riders go out for a drink once or twice a week, any stars will stay with them for a long time. For frequent flyers, I doubt very much if they bother to 1-star drivers if their wheels are a bit black. They shouldn't be in an Uber in the 1st place.

Riders do not cancel because the driver has a moderate rating. Most likely the next driver will be a few minutes away. Riders could have got home by then. And what would riders be afraid of? Unsafe drivers would have been gotten rid of very soon. Are you worry that the car is moderately not sufficiently clean? Are you afraid that you have to ask the driver for your preferred music? Are you worrying that drivers don't have water or mint? Or the wheel collected enough brake dust?

On the other hand, I cancel low rated riders all the time when they needed it most. When drivers start going home, when I got requests while having riders, why would I risk the trouble? 

FYI, a 1-star is as bad as four 4-stars. But it's only as bad as two 3-stars. Two 2-stars is worse than a  1-star.

How do riders worry about their stars? I picked up a group of drunk guys, one talking to passing cop cars. I believe they have a buddy working as a cop in the area. BUT he's not there that day. The app holder worried sick as I was dropping them off at the worst strip of the bar area. I kept telling him I was cool to stop him from bothering me. When he saw me giving him 5 stars, he tipped me $10, in the app.

A young woman went out to a bar at 1 am. She asked if she could sit in front. (Perhaps she saw the empty beer cans at the back from her neighbor that I just dropped off.) She starting chatting and offered me mints. Then she asked about her rating. I told her it was like better than me. She didn't believe it and immediately checked it herself on her app. She said it must have been cleared long enough. It was such a relief for her.","What a bunch of random drivel. Only pax stars are relevant since it allows drivers to filter them by rating. Pax dont get to choose their drivers like we do, they are assigned a driver. Sure if they dont like the rating they could cancel but that never happens, meanwhile drivers are basically canceling on pax left and right due only to rating and thus prolonging their pickups. I get what I think is the point of this post; don't worry about your ratings. 

But two points:

First, it's not 500 rides, but 500 ratings, so that could be 1000 rides. Who knows. 

Second you can get the same point across by saying, ”welcome to Uber, where the complaints are lies, and the points don't matter!

Or 

Your rating doesn't change the rates. I was deactivated after three one stars."
Why can't I schedule ahead of time?,13,65.22669266356363,uber,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

Just curious if the advance scheduling only has limited availability still? I'm in Canada and have an early flight that I'd like to schedule at least the night before but I can't figure out how to do so. Looked at a couple websites too and videos of it but I literally don't see the ""schedule a ride"" or the car+clock icons they reference. Am i just dumb or does this mean I gotta wake up even earlier morning of now to schedule it? What am I gonna do if there's nothing available then? (I'm also worried that there won't really be any ubers running at 4/5am either that's why I wanted to schedule it ahead too) I'd appreciate any advice, thanks

Edit:

(Also, how reliably do ubers show up on time etc too. I don't use rideshare much but don't have ton of options rn. My friend also mentioned he had invite link for $5 off but I had already made account by then, is there a way to still redeem it?)","To my knowledge, you can't schedule from/to airports! It's just so you aren't let down if a driver isn't available/your trip is canceled. The sheduled rides feature  is available in the app, but only in certain cities. To clarify it as well, it sends out your request 2 minutes before you scheduled window and searches for a driver. It doesn't necessarily mean you're guaranteed a driver! Hope that helps! scheduling a ride has no real benefit other than you checking it off of your list.  the rideshare drivers do not have a schedule so you are not matched to a driver ahead of time with uber.  with lyft you get matched but so what, that person can change their mind so it ends up meaning nothing.  open the app about 1/2 hour before you need to go and see how far away it says cars then you will know the amount of time to allow for your ride to show up, check the time again before requesting.
get your friends code and put it in the promo section when you request your first ride.

tip your driver cash Apex rider.. Here in Virginia we use a scheduler It worked for me just now. DT to YYZ. As for reliability... always give yourself ample time. 

Anyone who misses a flight because they were caught a few minutes in traffic had signed their fate the second they left their home late in a major urban city.  When I worked for an airline we used to ask people for ID if they missed the flight and would make locals pay (they should know Hwy 401 is always terrible) and gave tourists a pass. Only Lyft offers scheduled rides, and even then, there's no guarantee a driver will show up.  That's because neither Uber or Lyft show drivers where you are going or how much they are making (could be $2, could be $65) until you get in their car.  And they don't guarantee their drivers squat."
How much Surge u need to accept a 4.50 Passenger?,17,65.27274590431816,uber,"I'd say at least 3.0.  I ask b/c I was passing the airport today and got an airport ride for a 4.50 passenger, at 1.2x.

It's really hard to get a bad pax from the airport because it's just the damn airport, all they want to do is go home. I'd take a 4.0 from the airport. Their score likely just dropped due to being drunk assholes late at night, or perhaps they talk politics or something some drivers might be sensitive about. Out of 1800 trips I have only declined 4 trips all had under 4.5 surge or not. Just not worth having the one PAX with a bad attitude. 4.5 could have been a new passenger. I'd risk it. Anything under a 4 is a no go unless it's an even 4. Most uber drivers rate at a 4 unless they get paper money tipped.

Uber is denying to pay me the deseeved fare.,7,66.12239868212906,uber,"I am in Toronto Area and I drive uber part time. I picked up a passenger from location X and drive him to destination Y. During the ride he explained that he need me to make multiple stops and I responded that as long as he updates the location in the app, I will follow the route. 

1. Pickup at A to the destination B
Destination Y was a bank where he only needed to grab cash from atm and wanted me to drop at the original pickup location


2. Address changed to destination A
I dropped the passenger and then he explained that he need me to pickup his friend which was 10-15 kms far from the place where I dropped him. I asked him to update the location in the app and he did.

3. Address changed to C
I reached at the point C where I picked up his friend and messaged him on the app that "" I have arrived"" and he changed the location back to his original pickup point A and I followed that route 

After dropping his friend at the oroginal pickup location, I ended the ride and was only paid $4.51 for total of 27.46 kms and duration of 59 mins 20sec. I thought there has been a huge mistake from the uber and decided to contact them.

After contacting the uber support, they told me that the fare was absolutely correct and there is no mistake whatsoever. I explained thdm the whole situation that I only followed the uber's instruction and I didn't  try to help in outside of the app.

I know this isn't really big of an issue and merely a matter of $30-$40 dollars but I felt cheated. 

Please help me out on who should I contact and where to go next. Any help would be really apperciated","Sounds like you did everything right, not sure how uber doesnt have all the miles you drove accounted for. If you pull up the ride receipt it should have a map showing the routes you took, does it go all over the city like the real ride or does it just show the final destination as a non-stop ride?

I'd keep pressing them about it. At a minimum the app should at least recognize how long you were engaged in that ride which you could then use as proof that you didnt spend an hour going 4 miles. Keep in mind the support personnel are entry level workers with no experience in tech or anything at all really, it's very easy for them to get confused by your request. They are also notorious for making up answers to your problem just to get you to hang up when they dont know what theyre doing. First of all, they need to add stop before the beginning of the trip..

Second it’s a common scam that happens ...

Next time donot stop at multiple location unless it’s predetermined ...especially when it’s heading back to the original spot"

Is it possible to get unbanned by Uber as a rider?,7,66.34156534880952,uber,"Story time: about two or three years ago I was out and about going out for drinks and figured I’d Uber instead of driving because that’s just the responsible thing to do. Enter drunk dude. I had never met drunk dude in my life, but he saw me get out of an Uber and asked me if I could get him a ride and he’d pay in cash. I figured it’s my good deed of the day and karma or whatever and did so. Later that night I wasn’t able to get an Uber to go back home and I’ve been banned from Uber ever since. 

I understand that what I did was wrong/dumb, but Uber apparently doesn’t have a customer service number and all my email inquiries resulted in automated responses and rejections. I gave up on Uber, but I went out with this girl last night who said I could probably get back now since it’s been so long. I told her that afaik, bans are permanent and there is no such thing as appealing, but now I’m hoping I’m wrong.

How much does the look of your car mean to you?,14,66.76429683030204,uber,"To the drivers out there, i want to get an idea on your ""car standards"". Are you trying to make a physical impression when you drive with your car, or is it just about getting form Point A to B to complete the trip?","I want you to think I care about my car and I want you to think I care what you think about my car. I just want the interior to be clean and comfortable. I haven't kept up with the exterior as much; I've allowed rain to bey car washes. I have a car wash subscription and I clean the interior before I start driving each weekend.    

That said, it's a 2005 Honda Civic Hybrid, so I don't care THAT much about appearances. I just keep it clean for passengers. I'm here to make money, primarily. Nobody really cares about the exterior unless there's bird shit on the door/window. Interior should stay pretty clean unless some super muddy passenger gets in. You can definitely get by with a wet cloth wipedown and a hand vac every week or two Paramount. My passengers deserve a clean, comfortable ride. I keep armor all wipes on me, a lint roller, and I vacuum it out every day before I start driving.

I’m debating on getting WeatherTech mats for the winter in Minnesota. They’re $175, but to keep my car clean I think they’re worth it. I could care less. They are all over priced scrap to me. I care that the inside and outside of my car appear clean and well-maintained as a signal that the car's mechanicals are also well-maintained (and they are).

I routinely vacuum out the car and wipe interior touch-points with Sani-Cloth AF3 wipes (that doctors offices use for sanitation).  I also have a monthly subscription to a car wash two blocks away, and I drive it through at the start of every shift. i rarely ever clean inside of my car, it is self sustaining and even the bottom floor is protected with factory rubber mats, i just once in a while vacuumed floor that is it, the rain normally gives me free car was as it rains often for us 😂 My car is odorless. I swap floor mats like every day, so I can pressure wash it, dry it and use the dried ones. I had one complain ever that my car is not clean; I know it's a fake report.

I plan to do a self-service $5 wash every week, which is pretty good. But it's a lot of work. It's the $5 and the downtime. And I seldom wash the alloy wheels. Because you have to do it by hand and it's very polluting however you do it.

But I drive nights so nobody notices even if the outside is dusty and the wheel black with thick brake dust.

One day I drive in the day and got one complaint about the condition of the car. The message said maintenance but it's just a car wash and the wheels."
Uber: We’re doing a human trafficking awareness campaign. We need stock photo that says “Orson Welles” but relatable to millennials.

Just the other day I picked up this weird older guy at UC who was taking a younger asian girl to go cliff sailing. He was whispering weird shit like ""that's how you get ahead, your work has to be inspiring... mm yeh.. we love that."" With that creepy fucking tone.

She must have been barely out of high school.

Still that isn't enough to report to uber some weird shit. Not my knife to fall on man. Is that just some guy or is he involved with an anti sex trafficking non profit or something.

To me he just has a look of an aristocrat waiting to bid on a Laotian child bride.

If he’s just a model, they did a piss poor job on their choice. Wtf is wrong with them...how the heck are we supposed to get involved. Really doesn't guy sell liquor??? And what message that Uber was trying portray, it failed Hey Uber, I'm just an Uber driver, remember? I don't work for the FBI, nor the DEA, nor ATF.

Youll have to file a police report and the police will have to subpoena the information The police need to open an investigation, they’ll subpoena the ride records from Uber since this is a fraud/theft case. The police will see who’s account was using your debit card, confirm it, and prosecute. 

Always better to file the case as soon as you discover it, also inform your bank and they can freeze your debit account or help you see what else might’ve been accessed. just check the ride receipts sent to the email address registered on your Uber account. also check your spam folders. if it isnt there, ask support to resend them. There is an entire fraud support department that deals with these types of issues if you write in using help.uber.com.

They may ask for screenshots of your bank account for proof that you were charged, but they should be able to review the trips and your trip history, and refund anything that doesn't line up.

You can also direct your law enforcement officer to lert.uber.com where they can verify that they are indeed officers, and Uber can work directly with them and provide the appropriate account information to the police from there.

Uber didn't tell me they won't pick me up (1hr N of San Fran) until 1/2 hour before they were to pick me up. Missed my flight : ( I'll look for other ways from now on. Not happy.,8,67.45795423775358,uber,,"Can you provide like any more details on this? Sounds like something that's entirely your fault. Scheduled rides are pointless. If you live in bumfuck people may turn down your ride. Part of the cost of living in bumfuck, limited uber service As independent contractors we reserve the right to not pick you up. Maybe not your fault but not the drivers fault either. It is unclear what you are trying to say and are accusing is due to Uber (app? driver ?both?).  When did you order an Uber ride? Did you schedule it in advance through app or right away?  Are you saying a driver didn’t arrive until 30 minutes after you requested a ride?  Was it just one driver or did others cancel on you?  How long before your flight departure did you order the ride? What is the typical drive time from your location to the airport based on typical traffic at that time? 

My local airport recommends that passengers arrive at least an hour or more before their scheduled flight takeoff time (just to get through security and travel to gate). How much time was there from the time that you ordered the Uber ride request and your scheduled airplane departure time?

I am sorry to hear that you missed the flight, but your post doesn’t give enough information to determine whether the Uber app and/or your driver were to blame for your late arrival to the airport and therefore missing the plane."

Do I need a few practice rides before using Uber for something more important?,9,67.63891488592657,uber,I've never used Uber except as a passenger with someone else once or twice.

Gave out my first 1 star rat9ing today,9,67.94861396000066,uber,"This morning my husband and I found out our car had been towed due to scheduled road work that we hadn't seen the signs for. So once we figure out which lot the car was at, we hopped in an uber to collect our car. For context, we live in Los Angeles and the 20-minute drive to the lot did require some freeway driving.

We get into a minivan and our driver is a rather senior Asian guy wearing big women's sunglasses, and reeking of mothballs. You know the type. As we set off he asks me if he should go up the hill on our street, as the visible map on his phone is directing him to do. I'm like, um yeah, go on ahead. The first bit of our drive is rather uneventful but as we got closer and closer to the freeway onramp, he was 3 lanes over from where he needed to be. My husband alerted him to the fact and he moved over. No biggie really, he may not be familiar with the area. Then on the freeway he settles into the far left lane (of 5 lanes) at a pace of 50 miles per hour. People are getting annoyed and passing him constantly.

We start nearing our exit and he doesn't move over to the right where he needs to be to exit. The map clearly shows our exit is coming up. We get to the point where the exit is visible maybe 10 car lengths ahead of us and he starts slowing down like crazy. This man came to a FULL STOP in the fast lane of an LA freeway and then cut across 5 lanes of traffic with no blinker on and barely snuck in the last possible point he could make the exit at. Cars swerved around us, honked like crazy and, slammed on the breaks to avoid hitting us. It was a fucking miracle we didn't get in an accident. The next 5 turns/lane changes on the journey were all done at the last minute with no blinker, sometimes changing lanes mid intersection. Aside from getting us to our destination, I struggle to think what he did right driving-wise. I have never felt so unsafe as a passenger in a car. There's the stereotype of Asians and old people being bad drivers and man did he live up to both.","https://youtu.be/hlH9RGLJqxE

Laptop charging cable yep. medical transplant drugs. i'm in the army and uber when off duty. a mate called and asked how quick i could make it form a to b, and it was faster (an hour to hour and a half faster) than waiting for medical transport. and we served together so there was a level of trust.

it was fully sealed and had a battery backup for the cooling unit, so it made no difference who actually took it, so i did. the clinic waited for me to arrive and the doctor booked the trip while i signed the medtransit paperwork.

easiest 2.5 hour cross state trip i've done.

i've done a few others, essentially used as a fast access courier, but that was the most odd. Yes I have, and I got $50 for doing it.

They're my favorite type of ride because you don't have to worry about any pax issues or conversation or music choice. Just drive and get paid. 

Lots of medicine between different pharmacies, empty wheelchairs, blood samples to the lab (in a sealed cooler, no chance of spillage), auto parts from suppliers to auto shops. One time I legit transported an envelope full of cash some old lady was sending a client of some kind. what car is this, nissan? Documents, promotional T-shirts, and auto parts... But also pizza through Lyft once. I’ve transported a single key before. Guy was locked out of his house and his girlfriend had the key. So I drove it to him. When I got there a locksmith already had his door open. I’ve done (what I think were documents) runs a couple of times. What's in that package? A gift-wrapped 8-ball?

Now they be pretty dumb to do something like that but I've heard stories. Something to think about.

Some businesses handle urgent parts shipments from one location to another with Lyft and Uber. I've done those, it seems okay. A dog.

Especially if time is of the essence, like it always is. Check you insurance policy.  Mines has an exclusion on carrying out courier work without passenger present.

Some rideshare policies will allow it, but most underwriters would want you to have specific courier/delivery insurance. never have I transported a package or anything for anybody but I would like to try such a thing Too much responsibility and liability. What's in the bag?"

Honestly, the hub takes a long ass time to get to and deal with, but in the scope of things, it’s the fastest way. Your options are     

A) drive to the hub.    

B) keep resubmitting until someone half competent at Uber finally approves the document.     

C) don't drive for uber They can definitely help you, they push a couple buttons and poof it’s done.  I’ve had the green light hub fix a bunch paperwork issues instantly.

Nobody is ever going to *assure*  you over the phone that your problem will be fixed without you actually showing up.

Get a caretaker for a few hours and go get it done.  I’m sure any decent friend would be willing to do it. Let's see here. You have a problem, you were given a solution to the problem but you're don't like it. So think you are entitled to special treatment because why?"

Would it be ok to use a uber truck driver to help get a large purchase home (set of bookshelves)?,11,68.45004914523275,uber,,"Do you plan on leaving a tip? Tip in cash at the start and don’t expect them to pick anything up. As long as they don't have to do anything but drive, sure. Rent a uhaul or call ahead to ask the XL driver if that's OK.

What happened to uber pool?,15,68.55960933042897,uber,I am in Massachusetts and suddenly the past few days I have not been able to find the uber pool option.,"Pool was not profitable for drivers or Uber. Passengers always complaining about being late because of having to pick up others and going out of their way even though they chose the cheapest option. Passengers not being willing to walk 2 blocks or even cross a street when told to by the pool algorithm. I don't drive anymore, but I hated pool as a driver. I only had one pool trip ever that was enjoyable. Hopefully they get rid of it everywhere. I still have this option in Seattle. In my town lyft express drive is no longer available 

Soon lyft shared will no longer available due to driver rarely accept shared ride due to unprofitable In my area, Uber Pool and Lyft Shared rides are no longer an option in outer suburbs (only downtown and closer metro areas).  They probably removed it from areas with high majority of unmatched Pool/Shared rides with only one Pax. I gave an uber pool ride 2 days ago in Boston. It still exists there."
"UberX drivers, what's the best way for a PAX to request no music?",125,68.561333867466,uber,"Lots of time I need to make a phone call and I ask ""is it OK if I make a call?"" Driver always says, absolutely go ahead, and 90% of they time turns the music down or off. Many times they turn the music back up when I get off the call. 

Is there a polite way to let them know I prefer no music/silence for the ride? 

I don't want to be a dick and I don't want to get dinged on my rating - which I feel like has happened (4.82) before.

If the answer is - no, sorry, that's a dick request, get UberBlack - let me know that too (I won't get UberBlack, but I will lower my expectations).","Hey, do you mind turning down the music? I just want to wind down after a long day at work. Thanks. ""would you mind turning the music off? It's no problem with your music at all. I just prefer no music."".  

I'd have no problem with that at all These drivers are crazy. Just ask, that's totally reasonable. Say you'd like some quiet to concentrate on something. 
If you are a driver and would get upset over a request like this, you suck. That is some simple shit that I would happily oblige with. I am totally happy if I can, reasonably, accommodate a pax request regarding their comfort Personally, when I drive I love having the music on or having a conversation. I absolutely hate being stuck in an awkward silence. The person that said slap a 5 up there isn't wrong, but at the same time, that's dumb, don't waste your money like that. Ask nicely, and if the driver isn't willing to accommodate, then fuck em. Your rating might suffer, but your comfort shouldn't. Your rating will go down for sure. Most people dont like sitting in silence with a stranger. Luckily pax ratings dont matter much. I love absolute silence. My v8 sounds awesome. 

Please tell me to turn the music off. There's no one rule that works for everyone, since Uber drivers aren't a monolith. Some would be happy to turn off the music for you; others will do it, but will downrate you for that; and others just won't. I don't think there's a way to know beforehand.

It would be a nice feature request for Uber if you could tick a box while requesting specifying that you'd prefer silence (no music, no conversations aside from required ones), which the driver could choose to obey or not, but would at least see it in a formal way. Best one I’ve seen is ... driver arrived , pax gets in the car , and say hello how r u blablabla, and man I just got a hectic day... do you mind if we can have a moment of silence before I have to face my family at home, it’s the only time I can have a quiet nap time..

I ended up driving super smoothly just because I feel bad for the guy ... > Is there a polite way to let them know I prefer no music/silence for the ride?

Just ask,  ""he can you do me a favor..... ""   almost no one is going to care if you're polite about it. ""Would you mind turning the music off for the ride? I'd really appreciate it.""  There's no magic way to say it that will or won't get you a bad rating.  You're either going to get a bad rating for asking or you won't. bring your own earbud and listen to meditation or white noise I don't play music in my car unless requested. I enjoy the silence and it sparks conversation and I find I get more tips. But if I sense someone doesn't want to talk I just enjoy the silence. Most drivers are pretty cool just ask. Metal all the time. I think the best way is to just ask for them to turn the music off for a couple minutes because you need to make a call.  Personally, I like having something playing while I drive or having a conversation, so I would find that annoying.  I wouldn't rate you lower than 5* for it, though, but I can't say no driver would.  If you don't make a habit of this, then you'll be fine.  If you're doing this on every single ride you take, your rating will likely suffer. Seriously, that's a really basic request. If any driver doesn't capitulate you should absolutely one star them and not tip. Refusing to do even the smallest thing (like turning a nob) to make you comfortable while there transporting you is the dick move, not you for asking. 

Also, You shouldn't have to bribe your driver to get them to do there job properly. He or she is already collecting a fare for the ride to begin with after all. Claim you have a headache. It's a perfectly reasonable request.  Just ask in the polite manner of your choice.  Hit their rating if they refuse.

Do keep in mind some drivers will always suck, it's the nature of the beast with rideshare. I personally don't mind music as I usually bring my own earbuds and listen to podcasts most of the time. As long as its not BLASTING so I can still enjoy my show. One time I had a ride at 4am, I was going into work, still a little groggy, and the driver shows up with music blaring like a party bus. Had to listen to that for 20 minutes solid because I was too shy about asking him to turn it down a tad. Just ask nicely lol.

Although I'mma be honest if a falcons game is on I'll only turn it down I mean this in the most respectful way possible, but you're not really paying enough for an UberX ride to make your driver in silence if that's not what they want to do. Drivers don't make a ton, and sometimes music is one of the only bright spots in what can otherwise turn into a pretty repetitive and sometimes difficult job.

Enjoy your very affordable ride, and let the driver work in an ambience that is most comfortable for them, so everybody wins. Simple, cash is always key... Simply slap a $5 up front, or more on longer trips, and ask for music off or silence. It's cheaper than Uber Black or Uber Comfort... Not on the app, as many drivers are used to hearing the BS of ""I'll tip you in the app"" and get nothing... Well, I don't think you're a dick but it is like the ONE perk of driving. Maybe suggest a podcast? [deleted] If you’re on the phone, I’ll oblige, I’ll even do it without you asking as soon as I hear the phone ring or see you place it near your face. But if you just want it silence I won’t, I can’t stand the silence. I’ll lower the volume but never silence it completely. My comfort over yours any day 100%. 

If you insist, I’ll assume you’re rating me low, I’ll rate you 1 star automatically and still keep the music going. 

If you like the silence maybe buy some noice canceling headphones. I don’t talk to people that have headphones so whether you want to listen to your music or be silent, most of the time if I see someone with headphones you’ll remain unbothered. 

You’ll probably get nicer drivers that bend over backwards for their passengers and will happily drive in silence, but you’ll definitely get drivers that will get annoyed by that request and rate you badly, so why risk it? There’s no radio on a bike.

There are lots of variables, how long are these rides, what conditions are they in, what are you doing while your back there, does it need to be off? Could lower the volume work for you? (Still able to hear the music, just quietly)

I do this because it’s a low stress job. The more requests that seem entitled, the more likely I am to rate you low. A 4.8 is an average rating in many cities. 

If it’s a short ride (1-10mins, <3miles) I’m already bugged, I tend to listen to music very low in the first place (vol 5 out of 50) so asking to turn down the volume is already kinda annoying. But if I see you are reading documents, I’m more understanding. 

Mid ride (10-30 mins, 5-30 miles) this is prime earnings ride, just about anything you ask nicely, I will shut up and take it (so long as we are not in traffic for 30 min going 4 miles.)

If we are in gridlocked traffic, I want to dump you for picking now to jump into this shit. The music is there for my benefit, not yours. Every particle of my being is telling me that $5 isn’t worth the 30 mins we are sitting here in this shit. This is your stupid idea, shutup and take it. 

Long rides (30mins+, 30 miles +), these are tricky,  what are you doing, having a 45 min phone conversation? I don’t want to hear it. Practicing your opening argument? I don’t want to hear it. Blaring your earbuds so loud I can hear that, but you would not tell me a station to turn on, I don’t want to hear it. Playing a video game with bing, bop, boop, bop sounds, I REALLLY DONT WANT TO HEAR THAT IN A SILENT CAR. FaceTimeing someone or having a call on speaker phone, gtfo. 

Yesterday afternoon I had a lady day drinking with her friend, she took an hour and a half ride home and slept in the back seat the whole ride there. That’s prob my new favorite ride. No second guessing the GPS, no phone calls, no fruit slasher, no YouTube videos, and for me, classic vinyl on sat radio set to 3 out of 50. Cruse control set to 65 and I’m in right lane heaven. 

To me, as long as it’s not stressful driving, feel free to ask for low volume. That seams fair. Or if the ride is long, ask if  they can play your style of music or station. 

Honestly, I think phone calls are more likely the reason for your rating than asking to turn down the radio. If they are short calls “hunny I just landed, and got an Uber, we should be done at 5, and I’ll be home at 6:30 is a fine statement. If I’m part of the phone meeting about the roofing issues at 123 sour street, I’m not interested and would prefer you wrap it up. There will be 23hours and 45 more mins in the day you can do this call, make it then. If you have a 45 min call about your sister sleeping around and that she tells you she wants a divorce. I’m having a conversation in my head where I ask you if you think your sister wants the Uber driver to know how much more she likes the size of this dudes dick. they work for you. Just say ""Hey, can you turn off the music. I have a ringing problem in my ear.""  You make up a medical reason so the asshole drivers might not ding you. $20 in cash could work. $50 will definitely get the volume turned down."

Uber Scam: the Pool and X bait-and-switch,3,69.31785007120283,uber,"Hi Uberinos,

I regularly take Uber and Lyft, as a car-free Angeleno. I always take shared rides, unless I am in a hurry. I also always, always, always screenshot.

Long story short: The past two weeks, Uber has tried to scam me THREE TIMES the same way: by charging me for an UberX instead of an UberPool. This has happened taking rides between the same two locations. 

I called them out the first time and got the usual ""Oh wow sorry, our mistake!"" robo answer through the app, and they corrected the amount charged. I just complained about the other two incidents, which happened on the same day last week. I don't expect much from customer service, but am super peeved I have to constantly monitor Uber's sketchy practices.

Is this happening to anybody else?

Thanks!

Jackie","If you ride in cars, you’re not carfree. For the record, here are Uber's responses. They are completely opposite in their determination, despite regarding the same exact issue.

**TRIP 1: Uber is an asshole.**

Me: I ordered an UberPool, not an UberX. I have screenshots to prove it. This is the third time Uber has done this this month and it is extremely suspicious. Please refund.

Uber: Hi \[name\],

Thanks for reaching out. 

After reviewing your trip information it looks like the fare matches the upfront price you were shown when requesting the trip. Due to these matching amounts, we're unable to adjust your fare for this trip.

For more information about the product options in your city, click \[here\].

Please feel free to reach out. We're here to answer any questions you have.

Thank you.

Me: Please refund this trip. I have proof in the form of screenshots.

Uber: Hi \[name\],

We understand you wanted a refund, however, \[sic\] that is not in accordance with our standards at this time, and we will be unable to fulfill this request.

Please know that we review our standards on a regular basis, and feedback like yours is valuable as we continue to design more helpful support experiences for our driver partners. 

Thank you.

Me: Please refund this trip. I did not take an UberX; I took an UberPool. This is the product I ordered, and the product I received. Please refund the excessive fare I was charged asap.

\[AWAITING RESPONSE\]

**TRIP 2: Uber refunds me.** The company also implies it's my first time....doing what, exactly??? 

Me: I ordered an UberPool, not an UberX. I have screenshots to prove it. This is the third time Uber has done this this month and it is extremely suspicious. Please refund.

Uber: Hi \[name\],

Thank you for letting us know.

We're sorry to hear that you didn't intend to select UberX for this trip. 

Seeing as this is your first time \[???\], I've adjusted the fare to the UberPool fare, which you intended to select. 

You'll see the difference in fare on your original payment method in the next 3-5 business days. You'll also receive an updated receipt email with the new fare.

Going forward, please verify that you are choosing the vehicle option you want at the bottom of the app.

Thank you.

Odd Compromised Uber Account Scenario,1,69.37794266379542,uber,"Hi Everybody,

Ran into an interesting case with my uber account this past week and was wondering if this has happened to anyone/ had advice as Uber support is just terrible. 

So basically, I get an email stating that I had taken two rides in New York City for a substantial amount, which is odd because I live all the way on the otherside of the country. Next thing you know, I get another email stating I took an uber from Austin,TX to Houston, TX. I get concerned and go straight to the bank (I fortunately work right next to a branch that I bank with) cancel my cards and file a claim. Next thing I notice is that the payment options had automatically updated or had changed prior to my credit card/debit card cancellation and that my Uber Rewards program had completely reset (I was grinding to diamond, humble brag). Now everything is starting to clear, but still I have some questions. Has this happened to anyone or have you heard of this happening? Can I get my old account back I guess? And how do I speak to someone at uber and not just get automated copy & paste responses????","Have you tried turning it off and back on?

Scariest looking passenger?,16,69.59768803420167,uber,"I pulled up to the pickup spot and saw my pax waving me down. He had multiple tattoos on his face, including two smallish symbols under one of his eyes.

I was freaked out and barely wanted to look at him because having filled-in tattoos like that means you're a killer.

It was surprising because the apartments are extremely nice and high-end. I was also able to recognize a bunch of luxury brands on his clothes.

He looked as if he was 21 or a bit younger. Thankfully he was cool in the car and didn't yell or anything.

But what gives? Uber is making us drive around rich murderers?","First off, you're judging him by appearance and also  contradicting yourself. His tattoos scared you even though you didn't know what they meant. But then he's wearing nice clothes suggesting he has money which would normally make you feel safe? Did you think he was a well paid hitman? Then you mention that he's pleasant and not making you uncomfortable whilst in the car but you still call him a murderer? Him being who you were supposed to pick up and being respectable to you in the car should have been all you needed to know. Tattoos do not make someone dangerous. Get your story straight and your act together. This is why drivers don't get to see what their passengers look like before accepting. Honestly it seems like you may be too young or ignorant to handle the job you've got. I've never seen a serial killer with face tattoos. Lots of people who got way too high once have them. You watch too much TV. Had a dude looking like Terry from Reno911. Cut off daisy dukes, small t shirt. But filthy, red and sweaty. Not even joking, he was a strung out male prostitute. Asked him a few questions through my open window while backing away and canceling the ride. Felt bad cause he looked desperate but that could be dangerous too My scariest passenger was just some tall skinny white guy wearing a very heavy coat in weather that didn't quite require it, carrying a backpack. Picked him up from a gas station.

Now that wasn't enough to get the alarm bells ringing. It was when he started talking about not wanting to get pulled over. Like, drive careful, I can't afford for you to get pulled over. Like WTF.

if you're carrying drugs in my car, at least be cool and don't leave anything behind. Those are my only two rules. Be cool.

to the point. People's behavior gives me far more concern than how they choose to present themselves. Was it Post Malone or Lil Wayne? Fuck uber I dont want KILLERS in my car. If i cancelled that wouldve hurt me too WTF uber."

In my case, since Uber already disclaimed responsibility for itself and drivers, I cannot successfully file a criminal litigation through the prosecutor in Ohio, and since it is a misdemeanor case there will likely be no follow ups from police to my police report i filed in Cleveland, while the overall cost of civil litigation in small claim court is higher than the value of the lost item for me. The current reality is raiders are likely have no effective mean to reclaim a small value lost item if the driver refuse to return it. 


Furthermore, some drivers might see return a lost item as optional when there is no clear community guideline. My driver very clearly told me that he think he is free to decide whether to return it, keep it or seIl it even after two months and my repeated complaints on Uber app support. In order to fundamentally prevent further incidents like mine from happening again, I highly recommend Uber revise its community guideline and clearly state any lost item should be returned within reasonable amount of time when a owner is known and actively pursuing its return( typically a week or two maybe?). Fortunately in my case the value of my lost item is not significant, but for others it might be life altering. I hope Uber can recognize the serious and urgent need to add a detailed lost and found policy in community guideline.","This will sound shitty. But it is what it is. You should keep better track of your belongings. Why would you expect a driver who realistically drives for 10 an hour to go out of their way to return something that you may not have even actually left in the vehicle? You probably gave them no tip and a crappy rating on top of it. 🤔 How about stop leaving shit in the car ... Like a baby.. when leaving car like leaving house keys check wallet check and phone .. check.. Oh man, that sounds really rough.

Have you shown this website to police? t.uber.com/lert

It's how police can make data requests from Uber. If you think your item has been stolen, tell police and give them that website. Things tend to get resolved really fast at that point. Nah it's fine the way it is Uber is BS and their drivers have no respect. Read my previous thread of all the drivers being assholes. Uneducated morons. Unfortunately, both Uber and Lyft (as you point out) disclaim responsibility for both they, and the driver. However you are fundamentally wrong in your thinking. The driver, by knowingly keeping your property, is committing a crime. Uber’s policies have 0 effect on that fact. What the exact crime is called, will be largely determined by your locale. Getting the police to act on that crime, likely the same.

Believe me when I tell you that Uber/Lyft are chock FULL of criminals currently driving for them. Remember, neither platform prohibits people with felonies, including theft, from driving on their platforms....they just can’t be recent. Remember that monitored self-driving Uber car that killed the pedestrian in Arizona? The “monitoring” driver is a convicted Felon who was (and she still is) CURRENTLY ON PAROLE.

All I’m saying is that when there are no requirements for entry.....obviously, anyone (with limited exceptions), can enter.

You run a circus, and you pay peanuts, you can’t expect anything but Clowns and Monkeys.

This is the current state of the driver pool of both Uber and Lyft. This is EXACTLY why they fought so hard to prevent fingerprint background checks. Literally, they spent millions between lobbyists, and Attorneys to prevent fingerprinting as a requirement. This is also why in California they, (U/L drivers), are prohibited BY LAW from transporting anyone under 18 alone.

The more you know, the more sense it makes......"
I met a unicorn perfect rider,6,70.43676210832265,uber,"He dropped the pin on his own house instead of using his home address. Instead of correcting it, he shared his location with me. He called me when I almost got the cancellation fee. Instead of giving me his correct street number, he asked me to find him by the icon on the driver app. Even if he is a guest, there is no excuse because every house there has a build-in, easy to see number. He is standing in front of the house with the number behind him.

He had a paper cup of coffee in his hand.

He turned down my offer to put his hand-carry into the trunk. He dragged the metal framed thing into the back seat, bumping off everything.

He started giving directions before I drove off. He told me to get into carpool lane and get out of it before I manage to. And many things in between.

He was on the phone too; I can't tell if he was talking to me or the phone. 

I was very surprised that he didn't tell me the airline before I asked.

He asked me to stay on the left lane; I thought he was going to the car park. Then abruptly he told me to turn right into the airlines unloading zone where everybody goes.

The saving grace is that he took the coffee cup (as if to eliminate the possibility that I charge him the cleaning fee).

But then he was left with one hand to pull out his hard metal hand-carry. Bumpity bump all over again.

Beat it!","Sorry, move your pin to where you are or Walk to it. I'm not coming to get you where you are Vs where the pin is. I already am MUCH happier doing this. It's pretty much even Uber's Policy, Pick them up at the pin. If they don’t answer me after the cancellation fee comes on, and I call or text them, or if they tell me some far off address and want me to drive blocks away or to some other part of town because they didn’t put the right one, I cancel. They need to communicate right. I had one nice person tip me $100 bill the other night because I picked him up seven blocks from the ping spot and drove him to go get his work truck from a parking lot. Now THAT was a rare rider!"
Uber more expensive than lyft?,4,70.47590562684944,uber,Been taking uber for a while then I switched over to lyft cause I had a promo code. However whenever I decided to uber or lyft I always open up both apps and compare prices.

Sudden drop in rider rating without taking a ride for months. Is this normal?,8,70.51781534908547,uber,"Not your usual, 'why is my rating shit?!' post but very similar. For just over 3 years I managed to keep a perfect 5 star rating, albeit with a very sparse usage as London's transport network is decent in the night time now; and I even showed it off to a few friends when we were doing the dick measuring contest of highest Uber score a few weeks back.

This Friday just gone however I took two Ubers and before I booked the first one I opened the app and my score shot down to 4.40. The last ride I took was back in March, so I'm really confused how it statistically dropped down that far. Furthermore, the two rides recently didn't affect the 4.40 rating at all which I could understand if they didn't bother to rate back instantly.

Opened a ticket but got the usual bollocks about slamming doors, pickup locations, tipping, etc.

Anyone else experienced this?","I’ve had my rating adjust randomly even when I don’t use Uber but only by 0.05. A 0.6 drop could be a mistake, I would try to contact Uber support if possible and ask them if it’s a fixable glitch or not If you had 10 5\* ratings and got a 1\*, that'd be a 4.6 average over those 11 rides.  Someone 1\*'ed you, most likely, and your sparse usage isn't helping the average. Supposedly uber scrambles up the order and holds back a rating or two so you cannot retaliate on the driver.  Sounds like thats what is going on.  As far as the drop,  perhaps the time for you to rate/change your last driver expired and and that rating was factored in. Why do you care? There are that many Uber drivers in London (40,000), not a single one of them is going to refuse your booking based on a user rating"

Does anyone (driver) Uber only when there are large events in your city?,3,70.63879914540384,uber,"I'm thinking about trying it out just for extra cash, but I only want to do it when a lot of people are expected for an event (e.g. Gencon, concerts, sporting events, etc).  Do a lot of other drivers do this as well?  Is it worth your time?","It all depends on what you want to do but several drivers do just this. Try it and see how it goes, the one beauty of U/L is the flexibility on when you work. That is the only benefit lol Indianapolis driver? I am as well. I attend Gen Con myself, but I also drive in the evenings because there's so many people. It's a good way to make money back that I spent at the con, lol. But in seriousness, there will be plenty of rides and Gen Con attendees are usually generous with tips.

As for other events, yes, they can make you money. The night of the Taylor Swift concert I made almost $400. The Big Ten football championship game has consistently been the best (since there's 70,000 people in town for one night). I always make at least $300 that night.  


Indy's a good market for weekend and event driving. There's always something going on so there's always going to be rides. Good luck! I Drive Friday and Saturday nights. Major Holidays and Once in Awhile I drive a Concert From Patriot Place, HOWEVER I'll only drive the first show and not the second on the following night. The second show is never nearly as profitable as the first ( from there ) and a lot of times I'll just drive people going to the show and not people coming from it because when it lets out it can take a solid 45 minutes to get out of the parking lot."
Uber screwed me. Any advice?,34,70.67203988614457,uber,Took an Uber the other day and made sure to enter all information accurately. Driver gets to what he thinks is the location to drop us off.

I've emailed support and gone back and forth with them a couple of times but Uber refuses to issue a refund or credit. Any advice?,"You were driven to the location you entered. GPS data isn’t off my 10 blocks.

No refunds for user error. Make sure you enter the right location next time? Where were you going?  Let’s see some proof that this actually happened. Did you not look at your own phone to see where you were? Can you stop acting stupid

Question for the Drivers out there,32,70.757294515788,uber,"I am curious to the brand loyalty of the Uber/Lyft/Other drivers.  If a competitor to your current employer offered you slightly more money to switch (+$0.50 every trip), would you switch over to their company instead?

I just want to understand if money is the largest factor behind your organizational choice or if it goes deeper than that.","I don't think anyone on Earth has any loyalty to Uber or Lyft lol. I’d Keep driving for all and whoever gives me the rides is who gets me at that moment Passengers will use whatever is cheapest. The most die-hard Uber lovers will take a Lyft ride if they can get it a dollar cheaper.

Drivers don't care about the platform, really. Whichever keeps them busy and limits downtime between rides. I think the Uber app itself is better than the Lyft (especially at night with the night mode) but I run both, and go with whatever gives me the ride first.

What needs to come out is some rideshare service that works somewhat as well as Uber and Lyft, that doesn't blow insane amounts of money on ridiculous HQ in California, R&D for self-driving cars, and paying for giant call centers in India who are utterly useless. Cut all of that unnecessary expense away. It's insane. Pass that savings onto the passenger, and give the driver a slightly higher pay. If it's cheaper for the passenger, they WILL use it.

I hear there's some new one in Europe that checks all these boxes, but they haven't come to America yet.

It's just ridiculous that on a 2 mile ride Uber/Lyft will charge $3-4+ in service fees (sometimes more in certain markets), and then on a 25-to-30-ish mile trip, the passenger gets charged $40 and the driver only gets $25. There is no way there is $15 in expenses for Uber/Lyft. Absolutely no way.

I also wish the driver gets $5 minimum on any ride, even on the shortest 0.5 mile ride. Getting $2.49 is just a slap in the face. By the time you drive to them, wait up to 5 minutes for them, they get in and buckle up, you get going, drive for 5-8 minutes in traffic, drop them off -- that's near 15 minutes of work for $2.50. $5 would at least make this bearable. I am in a small market so I drive for both. I also will switch to whatever platform is paying me most at the current time. (I.e. surge) In the Chicago market, Lyft pays more but there are usually less rides for me in comparison. 

I utilize Uber mostly, and pretty much know exactly how much a ride will be, once accepted. 

$1.34 base
$.6075 miles
$.2055 min 
$.255 wait time / min 

Then add in surge, etc. Lyft rates are actually higher in all of the above areas but the downtime between rides is a negative. That being said I have been driving for both platforms PT for over 2 years. 

I have over 1,000 rides on Uber and over 675 rides on Lyft. Not driving a ton but definitely have been with these players for a while. The changes they have implemented since inception and even my join date have been enormous. 

When Lyft came to Chicago they were paying drivers great and giving promotions to riders ALL the time. I can see that my earlier passenger rides circa 2017 show me paying less than $1/mile to the driver for the fare. Today the rides cost more and the driver will get paid less. The brand loyalty was there for several months as an early driver but that also had to do with the publicity at the time (CEO of Uber and the ousting). After that I joined both platforms and here we are. Could I juggle all 3 apps at the same time?  sure... heh I don't get paid enough to be loyal to any brand. That being said, Uber has the passenger and food delivery where I have to run two seperate programs plus more effort for food delivery in postmates. There's Uber, Lyft and even one called Hoodrun now called Xpress Run now I believe, lol... Whoever has a ride available is who my loyalty goes to at that moment... Check out Hoodrun aka Xpress Run btw. Very creative. They're is no loyalty in this industry, either from the rideshare companies to is, or from us to them If you can run it simultaneously i don't see why I wouldn't. 50 cents extra per trip is laughable tho. Increase the per mile rate or even offer a 60% of Fare minimum protection. I hate seeing when either company makes $14 off one pax and i get $4"

How to unpair from a rider,12,71.2406625713546,uber,"Many drivers know this. This is for riders to know how easy it is. NPB has numerous bars but according to locals, only 3 are worth going to for different reasons. HB also has numerous bars but there are only 2 designated pickup points. So if you keep doing what you do, you can be as good as landing on the no ride list even if you have decent ratings.

On the driver app, tap on the trip. Tap on ?. Tap on ""My rider was rude"". For anything else, scroll down to trip issues, tap on ""issue with a rider"". Pick one including ""unsafe', ""made a mess"". 

After selecting the problem, enter a little bit of detail using a combination of custom canned responses on your mobile keyboard. Include a canned unpair request, and submit. It takes about 2 minutes from our South Asia colleagues to complete the unpairing and notify you on the driver app. It is one of the few things they are fully authorized to do and thoroughly competent to do.

Drivers don't need to rate in order to unpair so riders have no advance warnings. Better still, it doesn't matter if the trip is canceled, and it doesn't matter who canceled it.

For example, if you drive in the backseat, it makes me unsafe, asking me to maneuver without sufficient time. And distract me from reading the traffic conditions and signals.

If you see that the timer starts, don't call me and say I'm not at the pin. That will be rude. If you cannot come on time I will cancel and collect the cancellation fee. If I drive pass you, don't even shout and show me your middle fingers. That's disrespect and make me unsafe too.

If you want to go to a drive-through, most likely that will be ""make a mess"", or disrespect me when I urge you not to, or make me unsafe if you threaten me to.","So calling to tell you that the broken gps on my phone misplaced the pin by 50 to 100 feet is rude? I guess I learned something today. I would have thought that a driver would want to be notified. Wait I can block riders after the rating? This is great, sooo many times I autopilot past the rating on riders that I would rather not be paired with again... How do you expect people on this sub that aren’t from Orange County to know what HB and NPB is? Yup"
"Driver marks himself arrived blocks away, ignores passenger, cancels ride. Passenger still charged.

Driver marks himself as arrived while still two blocks away, stops at the lights on the wrong side of the road, as I'm crossing, he runs the red, swerves across 4 lanes of traffic and nearly runs me down. He then leaves immediately after and cancels the fare, which I get charged for. He was able to do this because he started the pickup timer 2 blocks out from the pickup. 

I emailed this to Uber and literally got 'That's an unfortunate experience, hopefully it goes better next time!"". No refund of the fare, no concern their driver ran a red light, nearly ran over a pedestrian, broke their policy regarding pick ups, and I get charged for the privilege.","Did anyone read what the dude posted?

>I take a pool every day....


I’m guessing that he picked the Express Pool where he had to walk and is bitching because he *didn’t* walk. Im gonna copy paste myself here 🤷‍♀️ 

I’m not trying to invalidate your experience, but as a driver, we cannot mark we’ve arrived manually. The Uber app does it automatically based on proximity. The lyft driver app allows drivers to manually mark they have arrived but this is not a feature of the Uber driver app. 

Secondly, sometimes, at least in my market, pool passengers are required to meet the driver at a location more on route w their existing passengers route. It typically is a separate selection in the order screen, however I’ve never worked or traveled in NY. 

None of these things can explain the reckless driving you experienced, however I feel like parts of your experience are not necessarily the drivers fault nor in their/our power to abuse anyway. 
The timers for us to cancel and get a fee stop counting if we are too far from the pin. It was an express pool wasn't it? You have to be at the marker because that's the only thing that represents you the driver can see. I've only taken EP once even I know this. 

And on busy streets, drivers can't just park anywhere Uber puts them at. They have to find a safe and convenient spot.

For express pools, we have to accommodate the driver. This is not a limousine service.

As for the supposed traffic violations, It's a he said she said conundrum. Why should Uber take your word over the driver's without any evidence. It's the man's livelihood at stake here. That entire post reads like it was written by NYC yellow cab drivers who are now out of work. i hope you pool riders all burn in hell. Uber driver cannot mark themselves arrived ... lyft can within 1 block radius

Uber driver have to physically arrived or passed the pick up point on the gps location 

Make sure you manually pin drop the gps location at the street you wanted to be picked up and not using “current location gps”

If you request Uber while you are inside your hotel/ office , gps location can be vary by the time you go outside the lobby, most building have 4 corners , most intersection have 4 corners , if you request to be picked up at 4th and Colorado , which corner for the driver to drive? Is it by the end of 4th? The beginning of 4th and Colorado, or is it by the beginning of Colorado and 4th or at the end? If the app said he'd arrived then you put the address in wrong or the GPS was not 100p accurate. In those cases you need to step up and walk to where it thinks you are as opposed to stubbornly waiting right at your place. Neighborhoods do this often. Also, uber does not let the drivers mark as arrived manually as lyft does. Best is to marked say you are at infront of Best Buy store , or any physical storefront , that way driver knows to drive north or south or west or east , most of the time they can’t just make u turn , so direction helps, if u say oh I’m in a building of Bank of America, , building have multiple entrance , north entrance? South? West ? east? The timer for the arrival doesn't start until AFTER he gets within very close distance to the address set for the pick up. There is no way a driver can start the timer without getting next to the pick up point. Therefore YOU placed the wrong address into the app or Dropped the pin in the wrong spot. I get this crap all the time. People putting in wrong addresses or wrong pin drops and trying to blame me for it. Pax continually ""drop the pin? and the location shown is across the street, not at the address of the pax, so the app shows the driver as ""arrived"" when he actually now must go up two blocks to make a U-turn to get the pax.  I take off one (1) star for not providing and actual and correct street address--and an additional star is taken off for every minute I must go out of my way to figure out where the pax is actually standing/  Not outside--take off another star for every single minute I must wait for you! When driver start a trip , rider app would show on tripp,

at any given time you can cancel , and it will ask you why you want to cancel, one of the option are driver pick wrong rider My uber drove past my pick up location and refused to answer when I tried to call him. I even sent messages to help him since I thought he was having trouble. Even though I could see that my messages was marked as 'read', he ignored me. My uber cancelled after driving over 6 kilometres away. Escalate. If they won't refund then do a chargeback. UBER SUCKS I really hope this sub isn't indicative of most Uber drivers.

My rating was 4.98 until a few weeks ago. I took an uber to a friend's 20 minutes away, and a few hours later I made the same journey back. I always say hello to the driver, and ask them how they are, but i have social anxiety so usually just strap myself in after that, and use my phone, then thank them at the end and tip. I can't think why my rating could be so low so quick? I can't think of anything I could have done wrong besides not engage in conversation :( It's making it difficult to get picked up now, I feel like drivers assume I'm a bad or messy passgener or maybe something else :/","As few rides as you take, any bad rating with affect your rating much more than if you took a lot of rides. You taking fewer rides will make a lower score more impactful.

That said, not tons of drivers gaf about your score. I know I don't. I'm a driver myself and I always rate 5 stars unless they do some belligerent shit. I actually had someone give me a one star because I was quiet the entire ride!

I great them, say hello and then proceed with my ride. I ONLY engage in conversation if they start off first. sometimes I ask a question to initiate but if they are short then I stay quiet.

So yeah man I completely understand why you're confused. as a driver, I was VERY pissed that they one-starred me for that. brought me down to a 4.94!!!! That’s how it goes, and lately the cunt face whiny riders are giving us bad reviews because they don’t like our pick-ups. These people are dumbfucks, they expect you to risk getting a ticket because they think they’re special or something, fuck them they’re trash and we don’t have to give them rides anymore. People are just shit in general There are some Uber drivers that will rate lower if a cash tip isn't given during or after the ride. How low is your rating now?  At least in the US, a $5 cash tip basically guarantees 5* as long as you don't light their car on fire or leave a biohazard behind. Think of it as the awkward squad tax?"

I don't really have the right words for it but it was pretty insane as we drove (long trip) and I started to realize this guy is twice the man I've ever been and wanted to throw this out there to the world instead of just leaving him a tip and forgetting about it and I guess even if it makes him good money, it's still weird that a man who sacrificed so much for so many years for his country is not compensated sufficiently (but I rather not get political/we didn't bring it up).

Did you add a one min finger into the mix? Don't use a purse full of money as an anchor. The driver got sick of you chitchatting and making him wait and after 5 minutes he cancelled. Your purse is probably at the GLH .I would do the same and you can pick up your anchor from the closest police station or GLH... The police will be able to contact Uber to get that.

Uber Driver Made a False Report,92,72.40646118256781,uber,"So an über driver falsely reported that I physically assaulted him and submitted a dash cam video as proof. The thing is, this did not happen (at least not with me). Uber banned my account pretty much immediately. When I asked them to verify the time stamp, location, driver, car, and passenger, they essentially refused. I sent them pictures of me from that day so they could compare to the person in this alleged (I have not seen it) video and confirm it isn't me in the video. They again refused to review the footage and my account remained banned.

They told me the video showed a person kicking the driver in the ribs and him begging them to stop saying ""I just had surgery there"". I've never kicked a person in my life, never touched an uber driver, never had any incident like this. I am a non-violent person and have never had a physical altercation of any kind in my life. I am baffled as to where this video even came from or how they thought it was real. If it is real dash cam footage the time stamp would have to match.

They won't show/send me the video so I have no way of knowing what the hell is going on.

I asked why the driver hadn't contacted the authorities if I had assaulted him like he claimed (though the reason is obvious - false police reports are illegal). They had no answer.

I asked them if they thought about why I would defend myself so strongly and fight them on this if there really was video of me committing a crime   - again no answer. I would be willing to testify under oath its not me and if anyone watched this alleged video they would immediately know its not me.

I begged them to please watch the video and compare it to the pictures of myself I sent in and they refused.

No idea what to do, no idea why they are accepting the video when I know its not me in it since I didn't do this.

There are scammer , but they usually canceling rides before they pick up to collect cancelation fees , even then it’s only$3 and not worth the time .

Or a rider calling uber , he is in a hurry , and forcing driver to take other route / speeding across the traffic ,  driver got pissed and let the rider out There is more to this story. Uber is the absolute fucking worst when it comes to driver/customer support. You are less than dirt in their eyes and they absolutely, positively will not lift a finger to help anybody. Unfortunately you're probably fucked. Use Lyft instead. Usually, when being blackout drunk, you don't remember a thing. just sign up with diff email? I wonder what did the driver do to you that make you complain ? Just use lyft. There’s always taxi , or bus It's called a Lawyer, get one. Why the driver do that to you? Even if you didn't do it, you must have done something else. Fest up. He can only use the video once. Not worth all his trouble if you haven't done enough,.

Just change your number. Uber is getting weirder by the days, I’ve had riders make false reports of me too and I’ve tried to call and show proof but they don’t accept it. I like Lyft better anyway.

Is this refund justifiable?,11,72.55047738629635,uber,"I requested an Uber on Sunday, that gave me an estimated cost of $10 and 15 minutes. 

The driver, when I got on, was singing to loud hiphop music blasting in the car. The first mistake he made was that he ignored google maps and then got on a highway, at which point google maps added another 12 minutes to the trip and said I would have to ride out the highway. The second mistake he made that was that he again made another wrong exit (this time he was supposed to get on a bridge) -- this time, he refused to ride it out, but reversed for a good 10-20 seconds and then tried to get on the proper ramp. He then assured me we will get on time and speeded -- I told him not to, but he did anyway. He then continued to sing to loud hiphop music.

I arrived 10 minutes later than expected to a wedding, and was charged $30 instead of $10. Uber refused to give me a full refund -- they gave me a credit of $5 and is refusing to give me more.

Should I be angry that Uber didn't give me a refund of at least $20, if not the full amount? I couldn't even get off the car because it was a highway.

Update: Uber is absolutely refusing to give me back anything beyond 5 dollars, this is ridiculous.","I hope you 1-starred the driver. I can't stand drivers like that. Makes us actual drivers look horrible and makes the brand look awful. (I have given hundreds of rides and have a 4.99 rating, all 5-star ratings but one person gave me 4-stars and ruined the 5.0 lol).

I'd fight it more with Uber. Say the dude literally didn't go the right way. $10 and $30 is a huge difference. That means the driver went really out of the way to make the trip longer (since we get paid more per mile) -- he knew what he was doing.

You can also dispute it with your CC company, but there's a chance that Uber will blacklist you or ban your account after you do that. What does the hip hop music have to do with any of this? He didn’t make any “mistakes”. He, quite literally, took you for a  ride. These drivers really need to stop doing this. When Uber does give a refund it takes away the amount made from the driver maybe if more drivers knew this they would stop screwing people over. Money talks. You should have rolled out of the car when he was reversing. Or say you need to throw up because of travel sickness. Once Uber has your money, good luck."

Pretty much anything other than taking the ride.. Once I pick up a 3.something rating, and this is in a good neighborhood in Austin Texas.. I’m very curious but the name is female and I don’t feel threaten or anything , but after I picked her up I understand why drivers give her bad rating ...

She walk towards the car , open the door , and didn’t greet or anything , and say” can you turn up the Ac , it’s hot here, 94f  day and my ac is already on full blast,

I said hi hello , and confirm her name , she said yes

She wear a reallllllllllly strong perfume to hide the weeeeeed smell, this is Austin so lots of people smoke.

SHE IS VERYLOUD , she is on the phone talking about her date to her girlfriend , something something about she got a busy weekend dating multiple people and have dinner at different restaurant ..

During 25 mins drive she just talking on the phone , asking for charger and get back to her convo 

I arrived at her drop off place , she said uhhh can u pull up to other side of the street so she doesn’t have to walk 10 more steps, the other street is a dead end , so I have to make u turn and waste couple of mins weaving through traffic

I rate her 1 Star for cleanliness, conversation , and bad location I love the rating. Protects riders and drivers. It is really hard to be banned from Uber based on your score so you have to be a complete dickhead to not be allowed to order an Uber.   
Drivers have said that everyone makes mistakes especially in the beginning but all agreed that it's really easy to maintain the minimum required score of 4.6 and last I read only around 1-2% of drivers are below that.   
If the driver or passenger give a low score they don't get matched again. Are you an idiot? You've always been rated. By Lyft and Uber.

Did you think only drivers got rated? Uber has always rated passengers. I agree it's kind of bullsugar for a taxi operator to rate passengers, but here we are... Not really since the vast majority of people dont use uber.

My driver was asked for a pin in order to start my trip,29,73.1795977567357,uber,"So this just happened on my last trip, never happened before, I got on my Uber and as soon as my driver tried to start the trip he was asked to input a code, I couldn't read his screen because was helping my wife to hop inside, my driver didn't seem to know what was that about and when I opened my app it said ""this trip needs a code to begin"" and the generated code, nothing else. So I was wondering if anyone has had that happened and if so, why, just curious actually.","Sounds like they may be testing a new security feature to make sure that the driver picks up the correct rider. By asking you to make a pin, and then giving that pin to the driver (and Uber verifying they match) it guarantees that driver/rider pair is correct. That's actually a pretty cool feature. This solves a LOT of the ""what's your name"" / ""what's my name"" bullshit and doesn't waste too much time. I approve. Lol Was this at an airport? Both Uber and Lyft are implementing this pin system at some airports, so that the queue works more like a taxi rank. I think they use this method with big events sometimes. Were you near anything big going on? This is a standard feature in Ola app, a Uber competitor in India. Every ride requires the passenger to tell the driver an OTP (one time passcode) to ensure both the driver and passenger that they are in the right vehicle. The passenger can retrieve the OTP from the app and an SMS they receive after the trip is setup.

Blows my mind why this is not standard in all ride sharing apps. I have lost count of how many times my Uber rides marked me as 'picked up' when in reality they were scamming me or picked up a wrong person. a new FIFO queue for airports this has been going on for a couple of years, but usually at large events only. Yeah it’s happened to me, I’m a driver too. It’s weird but I don’t know why it happens. This is great. I'm all for safety features like this.

Only thing is: there's been a couple of times when I would quickly order an Uber before my phone battery died. I got a new phone since but I wonder if this happens to other people. Not sure if there's a bypass feature or a different way to verify that you're the correct passenger (if both people checked each other's names, that would be nice). This sounds like a fabulous idea. I like that idea! this is actually a feature from a cab company India named OLA. they have the OTP feature. pretty cool. it's because some dunk bimbo climbed into a random car and got murdered so they think if they have to enter a code that it will stop that from ever happening again. Thing is if you dont remember to enter a code then you can still climb into the back of a murderers car so it literally accomplishes absolutely fuck all."

For Boston a lot of drivers for one reason or another don't get a Transponder so they get billed by plate and pay a higher fee for it, Uber only pays the transponder amount so they lose money each toll gate. ( I have a Transponder myself ) Because i don't carry cash on me, and never think about the toll until those specific trips. If you drive a rental car and don't have a transponder you get double charged."

Absolutely, especially in the United States, given the racist, abusive, violent, and authoritarian policing culture. I’ve been given weed and even found a knife and dab oil in my back seat lol part of the job. 

Obviously if you’re being pulled over and your car searched, you as the driver were doing something very wrong in the first place."
Help! Uber driver started trip without me!,7,74.31100979383069,uber,"My Uber driver just started the trip several streets away from my location and started driving to me destination. Then, when I told him he never picked me up, he canceled the trip. I was still charged $12 for the trip, though.

How do I get my money back?","Contact Uber Complain via the Uber app. If you get the normal totally awful customer service, complain via Twitter. If that doesn't work, demand to have your concern escalated via Twitter and wait a couple days. And, if that doesn't work, keep trying. 

This is a common scam. I contacted Uber via email and they reimbursed me. Thank you for your help.

I thought they would have taken a long time to respond or just not responded at all. That's why I asked here. I thought that someone else who had gone through this could have helped. Become an adult and deal with it You should have submitted yourself to your destiny. You should have patiently followed whatever master plan the driver had for you. See what happened? It's a lose-lose-lose situation otherwise. Now you can contact Uber but only if you earn less than $5 an hour. Or it's not worth your time.

And how is it possible? How long the trip last before it's canceled? Most likely he was at the pin, not you. And he is a genius pulling that off.

And next time, thou shalt not call the driver. Only pick up the phone if the driver calls you. And don't tell him anything unless you are spoken to. Repent or you will suffer the wrath of drivers."

How do you guys rate your Uber drivers?,70,74.60485238643432,uber,"As a passenger who takes a lot of Ubers I have decided to write down the rating system that I use. Let me know what you think or share your own rating system!

5 stars: A perfect ride. The driver goes above and beyond either through complimentary drinks and snacks, music selection, or just interesting conversation. Also, there can be no mistakes in the actual driving and the driver gets me to my destination quickly. This is a rare score and I've given it on only three occasions.

4 stars: Very good. This can be a five star ride with some hiccups or a quick ride with nothing extra. This is the second most common score.

3 stars: Average. Gets me from point A to point B but nothing special. The most common score.

2 stars: Poor. Usually an otherwise 3 star ride with a point docked for some reason. The driver could have made a wrong turn, was rude, drove too slow/fast, etc. These aren't the worst Ubers in the world and there is room to grow, but at the moment it is worth finding another Uber driver.

1 stars: Terrible. The ride was uncomfortable for some reason. Either the car was too hot, the driver played bad music, the driver was rude. The ride is also usually takes too long or the driver makes a mistake. Another rare rating.","I hope I never have to pick you up 😌 It's either a five or a one. In three years I've been using rideshare I've only given a one once.

Giving anything less than a five means I want you to suffer for what you've done. Nvm the guy is a troll he posts just to get reactions lol 5 stars:  A perfect ride. I survived the ride.

4 stars: Very good. I did not survive the ride.

3 stars: Average. The driver hunted down and killed my family.

2 stars: Poor. The driver detonated a dirty bomb in the city center, killing hundreds of thousands.

1 stars: Terrible. Humanity went extinct as a direct result of the drive. You're a fucking idiot. 5*: boring safe ride, got me there. you get a tip too

4*: excess air fresheners, idiot light on, other minor issues

3*: tried to convert me to their religion or political party, or insufficient A/C after asking 

2*: never used 

1* and report: serious safety issue, or no A/C after asking. Anything less than a Five star is a vote for the driver to be fired.  Drivers must keep a rating above 4.x (depending on the market, but usually 4.6).  So if they get even too many 4 start ratings they will be kicked off the platform. 5= you got to destination without any issues.

4= you had an issue but will take the driver again

3= you don't want diver again but aren't going to screw him over

2= not used

1= the driver shouldn't be driving I almost got mad until I realized who you were. Nice try. >The driver goes above and beyond either through complimentary drinks and snacks

Hahahahahahaha... this has to be the best part. How about we reimburse you in cash for the ride too and maybe give you a foot massage while at it? FOH. >5 stars: A perfect ride. The driver goes above and beyond either through **complimentary drinks and snacks**

Stopped reading beyond this point 😒 5 is nothing goes wrong.  Anything less than that without any real problems and you're an asshole. You sound like a shit pax, I'd 1 star you so fast and call support and make up some shit. This rating system is fucking cruel. As a Lyft/Uber driver in my past, riders that rate like this are easily the most entitled and nitpicky individuals out there. Fortunately, they're also rare. I maintained a 4.95 rating and all I ever offered was a clean car, choice in music on Spotify and the option for conversation, candy and decor on holidays. 

In my opinion (which you asked for), anyone you rated 3 or 4 should receive a 5, and any 5 should receive a $5 tip if it's that glowing of a review in their service to you. Pro tip: people go above and beyond for more money, not to affirm your impossible standards. The job is to simply drive someone from point A to point B, and if you're charmed by your driver's decorum, make it known that you appreciated it.

Your 2's should be 3 or 4's, hands down. Perhaps if you have time to look for another Uber while you're in one, you should look into a personal chauffeur while you're at it. I'm sure they'd appreciate your critical rating system on a ride by ride basis.

The 1's seems to be the only justifiable rating, but the margins for it seem pretty large still, as if anything between 'mildly inconvenient' and 'horrendous' are seen as no different in your eyes. It also sounds like you don't ask for them to turn the air on or change the music and just choose to sit in your misery, instead contemplating on how wrong they are for not reading your thoughts and body language perfectly while they pay attention to the road. That 1 star rating will certainly teach 'em for next time!! Oh wait, it won't, because any time a rider or driver rates 3 stars or lower, they're never paired with that driver again.

Lemme repeat that: any 3 star rating or lower and you're never paired again. That means all your 'average' good rides have been marked to never be paired with you again. Which maybe you're into, and maybe they'd be glad about it too in the long run. But the fact is that the app itself considers it such a shitty rating that it wants to save both parties the embarrassment of getting paired again.

tldr; re-calibrate your system & rate your driver's 5 stars for all rides except for ones that actually suck, and even then only go down to 3 if you really didn't like them. 2 & 1, sure if it's really that tragic, but 3 gets the job done. Really just get off the high horse. Always 5 Stars. They brought me from Point A to Point B.  That’s it that’s their job.They did their job so they get 5. I always leave a compliment as well. Tip in cash. No one has to have drinks or snacks in their Uber... that isn’t a standard it’s an extra perk, they have a compliment for that. 

The only time I’ve ever given someone lower than 5 was when my driver kept missing my exit more than three times. He claimed the GPS didn’t say anything but I heard it..  It was more scary than annoying. No compliment and no tip.

I have to ask. What’s your rating as a rider? You should be a driver. Your rating system is as fucked up as the drivers who 1 star all pax who don't leave a cash tip I start at 5 stars, the more mistakes or unpleasant details, the lower the rating. I usually always leave a 5 star review, most of my drivers do what I need them to, which is transport me from point A to point B. You’re joking right? If the driver comfortably gets you to point A to point B then they deserve 5 stars. If they go “Above and Beyond” then tip them instead of messing up their ratings. SMH I expect my few 3s and 4s are people with similar ideals to the OP.

I try my best. My car isn't that great, but I keep it clean and I have chargers for 3 types of phones. Other than that I don't offer any food or drink and I try to drive safely and follow gps. I like a chat and try to gauge if the pax wants to do that. Happy to stfu if they give me the cold shoulder.

It's ridiculous that your good rating is a 3. That really hurts a drivers rating and could impact their ability to make money and they realistically did nothing wrong to deserve that. On the chance that you're truly naive and not just a troll, let me share the following...

While it varies by market, it's generally accepted that if a driver's rating falls below 4.6, they'll be deactivated from Uber.  So by rating 4 stars or less, you're telling Uber, ""I want this driver off the road, even if I have to wait longer or pay a surge on my next trip.""  You're further saying that you're the kind of person who wants most drivers fired for doing a ""very good"" job instead of perfect.  If that's who you are, nothing we say will change your mind. boi fuck you. When you take an Uber you’re a hitchhiker. You have no right to be so picky. Unless you were in danger or the driver did or said something unforgivably offensive, you give five stars, or you’re an entitled asshole. LMAO this thread is just full of salty uber fags complaining about not getting 5 stars every single ride. If you go above and beyond - you get 5 stars. If you get me where I’m going uneventfully you get 4. The concept really isn’t that complicated. For every minute over the ETA that it takes him to actually arrive, I deduct a star."

What just happened?,4,74.67554683089256,uber,"I'm not a frequent Uber user but my experiences to date have all been great. Today I used the schedule function in the app for the first time. Just a couple of minutes before the start of the schedule time window the app advised me the car and driver details. I looked out the hotel window, saw the advised car sitting there waiting already. I walked out, glanced at the app again and in the few seconds it had taken me to walk outside the car and driver details changed advising me ride was 3 minutes away.

Did the 1st driver see me coming out and decide he didn't want to take me or something else?

Trip with the second driver went fine and as we left 1st car was still sitting outside hotel...","Driver probably don’t want a short ride and wait for the next long ride 

Or driver set his uber to xl /lux / select but uber gives him x ride , he can decline 

Or driver set a destination filter 

Or driver have multiple app on and choose which ever he/she want to take You are not Usain Bolt, it took you more than seconds to get out of the hotel. 

Scheduled pickup is not that reliable. The driver could have been there for 5 mins before the pickup time, then canceled after 5 mins. I’ve had people schedule trips and the app had me show up 25 mins early. I’ve called them and asked do you want me to wait here for 25 mins charging you the whole time, or do we go now, or do you want to cancel and just order a ride when you are ready? 

Don’t use scheduled trips, just wait till your ready then order it. Surely scheduled pickup is just the same as a normal booking the only difference is instead of my finger pushing Confirm Uber it's a computer?

The first driver obviously accepted the trip - I got confirmation of his details on my screen in the app. In the few seconds it took me to walk outside it 'disappeared' and then a minute or two later another driver confirmed - the one we took. 

If a driver accepts and then declines do I not get notification of that in the app? It was a 50 minute journey so more likely chances are he declined because of that than if a short journey."

I have an issue in my city where if you don’t speak Spanish to Spanish-speaking clients first they give you attitude and come up with shitty reviews like the shitty people they are.

Look, if you want to give someone a bad review make sure you’re telling the truth, like their car smelled or they were rude or they didn’t turn on the air for you. Don’t give someone a 1 Star because they aren’t fluent in your language or culture, don’t assume someone speaks Spanish because of how they appear. That’s stupid. Don’t make up lies just because you feel entitled to be a prick.

I also hate people who are dumbfucks.

It makes no sense to get a public facing job and not know the local language.  

As for riders that don't speak English, we'll that is on them.  No driver needs to speak anything but English in the US.  So riders have to use Google translate if they don't know English. Carry a big bag of ICE.. and offer it to your Spanish speaking shitty customers.. that sound set them straight. OP move to a market where most people speak English. I agree with the red curb part but the ratings, who gives a funk. I will rate a passenger a one star if I don't like them for any reason I feel. That's my freedom.

So I'm in Connecticut, and I often call Uber to handle short trips around university campus.

Anyway, I used to not tip back then (shame on me), and the price I paid was pretty much the price I saw on the app. But recently, I've noticed that when I tip, I get charged slightly more for what I've tipped. Now I believe there was a post addressing that issue way back, and it appears that it's some tax being appended to the tip. If that's the case, why in the world would I have to pay a tax to give a tip?

I had the opposite...In L.A. with the recent heatwave, it's in the mid 90's outside, and the passenger gets in and immediately says, ""Can you turn off the AC?"" 

No ""please"", no ""would you mind"", just an order to turn off the AC. I said, ""In this heat, no... sorry."" I turned it to a low setting and she said that she gets cold easily. Well, I get hot easily. She can put on more clothes. I can't take off any more of mine (well, I could, but then we'd run into another issue entirely). :)) 'it's not too necessary' cracks me and my friends up. it's our new response. Probably wasnt working. Rate low. Report. Some believe that the A/C makes their gas mileage worse. 

Some have broken A/C. It’s a crapshoot. Some rides will just be better than others. Give him 1* and report it Ac is for tipping customers He may not have ac at all? Tell him it's super necessary What’s your tipping history? Ask him not us Is your driver Bartelby? $20 and I'll turn it on 

If not sweat to death, idfc choose ""dangerously""  then type in alcohol smell. instant refund.  no ac????? 1* and report. Ac are a requirement ... report the driver ... he should be deactivated 1* and no tip it is definitely up to the PAX for A/C report him.

I took the first job I could find for 8.50, working at a shitty hotel

Comparing the two, I made so much more money working for the hotel, even at just 8.50 an hour. The expenses add up and it ruined my car (which I later sold) 

It might have been because the hotel was really close to my apartment, and I got really good benefits, but I swear even McDonald’s would be better money than Uber You make a lot more and dont need a car at restaurants, and it's a lot more fun College kids don’t go home with their Uber driver but they might bang  their server who gave them a free dessert. I drive in a college town. The vast majority are ruled out simply because they're under 21. The ones over 21 don't have as much free time, generally, or are out partying during the hours they'd be driving. There are many college kids driving for uber and Lyft, I drove for both platforms and still  do on weekends.  Some of the reasons many students can't drive for the platform is.

Age: most kids are under 21
Vehcile: most of them drive cars that dont qualify for the platform.

Plus loads of other options out there which pay better. 

Most college towns are already saturated with drivers currently. Because they do the math on what they earn after expenses. Good question"

No matter how good your days or nights are.. they aren't good enough.. there could be more.. better.. & you deserve it for doing a thing..

Naw but really.. hope it goes well for you & you don't turn into 1 of those.. they're becoming the rule more than the exception :-/ Good time to order emesis bags and ozium spray. Depends on your market. My market doesn't require a sticker and Uber certainly isn't going to send you a welcome packet."

Does Uber app home page show empty vehicles?,3,76.33656534952698,uber,As a rider when I open the app it shows me a map with cars on it. Do those cars represent vehicles that are empty and ready to be hired. Or is it a mix of free vehicles and vehicles that are carrying passengers at the moment?,"It is vehicles that do not have a passenger in them and are within range of your current location They are ghost cars that are imposed on the map to make riders think there's always available cars nearby. They do not reflect actual available cars near you. Uber acknowledges this and compares it to a screensaver. Those are maybe real empty cars, or they could be fake cars representing “the potential” for drivers to be there. 

If they seem to be sitting in a really dumb spot IE stopped on the freeway, or on the old abandoned mine shaft road, most likely dummies. 

If it’s in the middle of a subdivision and that car is always sitting there, it’s prob real. 

I know two people in my subdivision who only drive select, and I think they never turn the app off. 

It’s not a bad indicator however that there are about that many cars in a general area around you. Like if I check the app at 4:00 am and I see I’m the only car in a 30 mile radius, I’m pretty sure, I’m the only car on at 4:00 am in the morning."

"As an Uber rider, is there a way to put ""prefers quiet rides"" or the like so that drivers know not to talk to me?",37,76.38734081250098,uber,Question above,"Just tell them Make a sign and hang it around your neck. “Don’t talk to me.” Just put in your headphones after you confirm your destination with the driver or say something like "" I may drift off for a bit, been a long day"". Poor drivers can’t win for losing. 50% of riders want polite convo, 50% want you to say absolutely nothing and there’s no way to distinguish unless you act like a big kid and say “I’d really prefer not to chat, please.” Some service levels in some markets have already rolled this out. You set your preferences.

It's great. As a driver , I usually read the body language and only talk if initiated.. but I will silent and quiet after answering the question , usually the rider is the one who kept talking so I respond ..

Do you take long ride everyday ? That’s an option on Comfort level and above rides. It’s also an option for the driver to totally ignore your request. Yeah, when I see the driver is being highly rated for ""Great conversation"" , I am like [palm face] I love it when riders leave me alone and let me focus on driving. Uber Comfort has that option Just lay your head back and close your eyes to make it look like you're taking a nap. After a couple of minutes the driver will probably stop paying attention to you and you can resume facebooking or whatever. Take a $10 out, hand it to the driver and say, don't talk the whole ride, and I'll give you another. Watch, they'll be quiet!! Pay extra for Uber Comfort. Uber Comfort. I like a quiet ride too, but learn some social skills and tell them. You can take a bus 🤣🤣 [deleted] I hand them a small card letting them know that I'm deaf. True story. Text them prior to pickup But we love you though. <3 Just put on headphones or ear buds. Most drivers know to ignore you when you have anything in your ears. Believe it or not, many drivers ***prefer*** not talking to passengers. It's pretty hard to come up with fresh content to *entertain* passengers with 30 times a day. Just tell us you prefer not to talk much, I’ve had one rider do that. He was nice and said he didn’t speak English, Chinese guy and he preferred to listen to his audio book. Nothing wrong. I think it’s on the comfort setting. I always wonder if the drivers think it’s rude to put it on this setting"
Driver made a false report in retaliation,44,76.45694729398247,uber,"So I had an uber driver who was taking a route that I felt was less efficient because it had a lot more turns (this is in NYC so every turn could add a lot of time to a trip). I politely asked him to take another route. He ignored me and I assumed he hadn't heard me so I politely repeated my request (""Sir did you hear me I had asked..""). He rudely said no and refused to take the route I wanted which is against TLC regulations. One of the passenger rights is ""Take the most direct route to your destination or follow the route of your choice"". I pointed this out to him and he told me if I didn't like the route he took I could get out. He then began driving the wrong way and ended the trip on the app forcing me to get out of the car half way into my trip.   

I was of course pretty annoyed but figured I would report it and move on. 

A few hours later I get a notification from uber saying that someone made a report against me for being physical with another rider. I have never touched a driver or fellow passenger in my life and certainly not in this case. There wasn't even another rider in the car with me. It is pretty obvious that driver made the false report in retaliation.     
Uber didn't punish me but they said I now have this as sort of a flag on my account so if anything happens again I could be banned. I don't anticipate being reported again (first ever report in 7 years of using the app) but something like this could happen again.   

I contacted uber and said it was a false report but they basically ignored me. Not sure what I should do about this.","Did he follow the navigation? If not you can report that trip to uber .

Gps route , any deviation are recorded

Also next time take a video before you confront the driver so you have proof Driver hate backseat driver ... but to each his own 

Good luck Now that you confessed, you will be kicked out every time you mention the ""law"". You should feel lucky if you can open the door yourself and get out.

Give me one reason why I shouldn't kick you out? The law? Kick.  \>so every turn could add a lot of time to a trip

&#x200B;

LOL He can follow the gps

Gps on uber and lyft are the shortest but it doesn’t mean it’s the fastest .

Factor in traffic , detour and construction zone , driver should get u there the fastest / most convenient route .

I usually drive highway , and won’t take back route since I factor in wear and tear in my car and I don’t like bumpy rides , hence I take the fastest but not the shortest ..

In rare occasion I will take back route so I won’t be stuck in traffic..remember driver only get paid if they moving, sitting in traffic only make about $.20 per min, which is pocket change...

I can’t speak for your driver , nor nyc traffic/ route 

95% of the time I follow gps , or waze during rush hour 

And Uber gps or lyft gps are actually google maps , which is still suck compare to waze/ knowledge of living in the city for many years For me , the amount of scam driver pull is minuscule, rider on the other hand , they tend to complain about every little single thing 

Ac too hot

Ac too cold

No music

Music too loud

As a driver that have been driving allday all night , everyday , I take pride in the cleanliness of my car ,and the simplicity of promptness when I pick up and drop off pax.. on couple occasion , pax actually turn their map app with the voice on , to make sure I drive the pre selected route , and if I even exit the highway and take frontage road and merge to highway again to cut the traffic , they complain ..

I will just trust the driver , to deviate .2 miles doesn’t earn us much at all, with $.60-80 per mile that only cost like $.25 , I throw away more $ to homeless people than quarter of a dollar Who wants to bet this guy has a 4.5 or lower rating. Why don't you take a cab?  Thousands of them all over NYC. Was this a pool route?

 If so he might have had another pick up.

 Either way the drivers in the wrong and personally passengers like yourself back seat drivers are obnoxious.  he might have known something you didn't like an accident or severe stoppage.

Riders: Make sure you know the name on account if ride is ordered for you.,3,76.47714405325276,uber,"If somebody else orders a ride for you, make sure that you know the name that they have on their Uber/Lyft account.  In some cases it may be their full name or a nickname that is different than what you know them by (examples of recent rider names have been Princess,  Logan356,  LoveLife, the letter B, and Fetus).

Last night, I had a pickup at a hotel near the airport. As I was about to assist with her suitcase, I
gave the rider my name.  I then asked her if I could confirm her name before starting the trip (crowded hotel entrance).   She gave me the wrong name.  This instantly threw up red flags for me that I was probably not her driver. However, she insisted that the person that ordered the ride for her had given her my vehicle description and she had “verified the last few numbers of license plate”.    However, she couldn’t say any part of my license plate now that I had the trunk open.

I told her that I understood, but for driver safety and to not have my ride payment taken away due to “taking the wrong passenger” that I needed to verify that she was the correct person. Her giving me the wrong rider/account owner name and now not being able to even tell me my driver name was concerning.

Basically, her office had supposedly checked her into the hotel, but that hotel had no record of it and no room for her that night. As a courtesy, the hotel receptionist used her own rideshare account to order this person a ride to the nearby Marriott.  

That lady remembered some of the basic information about my vehicle, my description, and the license plate. However, she never got the name of the person that had ordered the ride for her, and she promptly forgot details about my name & license plate after I arrived. I understand that she was flustered due to a stressful situation, but it is exactly that situation that would lead to somebody getting into the wrong rideshare vehicle.  The crazy thing is when the hotel receptionist came out to confirm she had ordered the ride, she gave me her full name that is different than her Lyft account (but her name tag matched my app).

TLDR:  Make sure that you know the actual in-app account name of the person who orders you an Uber/Lyft.  Better yet, use your own account.  It is the responsibility of both the rider and driver to check (and be willing to share verification info back) that the other person matches the information provided on the Uber/Lyft app.","This will happen unless free and mandatory college is for everybody.

The only one thing you should ask is ""where are you going"". If it matches your app, it's not likely she took the wrong Uber. Not likely she would scam you. And it's nearby; you don't have much to lose. Don't be inconvenient riders and hurt Uber's image, LOL. And what driver safety? Does she look like she can kill you with her luggage?"

Of course, there's no way to refund the money I paid for the pass. Fuck Uber, switching to Lyft as of today.","Don't buy Lyft's pass either. They do the same thing


Edit: I don't really give a shit about points, but I've noticed this getting downvoted a few times. Can anyone give me a valid reason for why this could be legitimately downvoted? Bots? Lyft shills? Or am I missing something? Yea I was like there's no way their algorithm doesn't price this in, dont trust em Oh yeah the new Uber pass is pretty useless. I don’t see the appeal. They don’t even guarantee a discount anymore. I've noticed that too. The price barely changed even after getting the pass. I ended up canceling mine since it wasn't saving me any money to begin with. And it's pretty noticeable when I take an Uber twice a day during the weekdays. Uber ripping people off? I'm shocked! Lyft is worse. Don’t think Lyft is any better; this same issue is on Lyft as well. I have posts about it if you want to check them out. At this point, don’t buy any passes anywhere and always just take the cheapest ride at any point. What city? how does this work then? I mean why buy the pass if it doesn't give you a discount? Never buy an Uber or Lyft pass. These are scams. Same thing happened to me, and there isn't a way to cancel the pass either. I contacted uber support after a week of the pass and said I wanted a refund and the pass cancelled and while they gave me the refund, they did me ""a favor"" and let me keep the pass for the rest of the month. I contacted support again about removing the pass altogether and they said they couldn't. Ended up taking Lyft the rest of the month. This exact thing happened to me. The route I was using was my ""Price Protected"" one from the Platinum level benefits. I complained via support and they eventually explained that the ""Uber Pass"" price would be charged instead of the ""Price Protected"" route price, even if it was higher. It took a few messages and I had to ask for it, but they cancelled and refunded the cost of the Uber Pass.

Charging customers more and selling it as a ""discount"" is pretty deceptive, and I'm sure Uber will be facing even more lawsuits soon. Rideshare prices are going up regardless. Now all the liberal loonies will have to ride public transit with all the deadbeats that they love so much."
Uber Decals on my car...?,26,76.57741025697027,uber,"Just curious honestly,

I am waiting for my background check to clear before I start driving in and around Chicago and there is no reason it shouldn’t but once I eventually get the little Uber sticker to stick on my window I was curious if there was any other options?

I don’t know that I want a permanent decal on my car, I never liked bumper stickers and all that and my feeling is the same about permanently destroying my car with a sticker.

Does anyone have any other clever ways of making sure that the emblem is up but not having to keep it there forever?


Thanks !!","I have used one of these [removable suction-cup Uber/Lyft signs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TVXQWBJ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_gIBoDbGVMG3VN) that I got on Amazon.  

I recommend putting duct tape on the back of plastic sign and add washers to the nut/bolt holding suction cup. Mine has held up well for 1 1/2 years with these reinforcements. Otherwise, the plastic can crack with repetitive removal (try to limit bending) and heat in car.
I have only used one in the front windshield, and the other is backup if the first ever breaks. What if someone does Uber and lyft. Do they reach over and take the Uber sign out of the window if you get a lyft ping? There is nothing against removable decal. I went to the hub asking for one that I lost but the check-in guy gave me a stack. If the glue on each sticker last for 100 times of application and removal on the windshield, my stack will last forever.

Tape it up or make some sleeve. I now use tiny magnets, self-aligning too if you use two pairs or more. And clear UV resistant mounting tape for the magnets. It's just two tiny dots on the windshield. And 4 more for the airport placard if I ever need it. The uber decal is not perm. It can be placed and removed however many times you want. Just stick it up.After you take it down give it a quick wipe down with water, and it'll stick right back up. Just for an FYI, that decal is actually a requirement. For everyone saying just get a sign off amazon you CAN do that, but it needs to be in addition to the decal. Anyone not using it if it's reported and uber decides it's truthful can get you kicked off the app as well as is the cops decide to take interest in you and you don't have that decal you can be fined. They are not permanent at all, and you are required to have the airport one in your back window. I use a small pocket sleeve for each decal.

Rider place scheduled trip , while she was on the boat heading to the dock, she used currentlocation , Uber send me to a nice residential house with gate and security guard ..

Rider said “restaurant name “ 5 miles away.. told her she put the address wrong , and need to update gps location, she is new and couldn’t update it , and I couldn’t cancel . Good times.

"GIZMODO guys, if you guys are on this sub can you guys investigate why Uber lied about ratings protection?",5,77.54202831256997,uber,"Just the other day someone dropped me from 4.90 down to 4.89 and it was the drunks I was driving I believe, but no one left a comment.  Maybe they were pissed off about surge? Or maybe some other passenger from the past found out I decreased their rating and they retaliated, Uber allows passengers to update ratings days or even weeks later.  But drivers can't update passenger ratings, and Uber drivers can't by default get a 5 stars if no passenger rates them for 24 hours like Lyft does.  So the rating system is disadvantageous to drivers.

I personally have a theory on why Uber purposely makes the rating system suck for the drivers and not passengers, Uber wants drivers to get addicted to increasing their ratings so they can stay on the road longer and keep driving people more.  What happens when a person like myself sees rating drop? I will say ""Oh shit my rating dropped, better drive some more people so I can get it back up.""

If enuff news coverage is done on this, Fuber will follow Lyft and make ratings more fair for drivers.","Well I can say that the last time this happened to me I looked at my earnings for a week.

I decided that if the rates are going to get cut repeatedly that I would do deliveries only for a while.

Well it seems as if I’m making the same and I’m getting tipped more.I have not had a person in my car since February of this year.

IMHO it seems as if the pay is about the same as a traditional Uber, before hulkamania runs wild on YOU Ratings aren't that important. Someone rated me 1 star because I didn't let them smoke in my car. Oh well. Move on. You want to know why uber lies?

They are the biggest  taxi company in the world  and dont owned  one car..they buy no gas... their so called insurance is crap and they pay so little  because the insurance company knows  drivers for uber already have to have full coverage insurance and in some states the have to have rideshare coverage..let us take time to do the math ....15000000 rides times minimum 3.25 per ride they get that is 48 million  dollars a day the uber company  get a day ... minimum.. we all know they get more than 3.25 per ride but that the least they take.....so why do they lie. .... because they dont care"
Uber driver saved my Dad’s life,31,77.56918109034774,uber,"I wanted to share what one stellar Uber driver did. My Dad’s nurse called me to advise he felt dizzy and was asking to go to the hospital. My Dad was a Korean era vet and we had to drag him to the doctor for treatment for his stage 4 prostate cancer, so we knew the situation was dire. Dad lives in a poor rural town 40 miles away from us so we couldn’t call an ambulance because the closest hospital to Dad didn’t have the facilities to treat him and if we went there and drove him we would lose 60 minutes before we could get medical attention for him. But there were two Uber drivers passing by the turn off to his rural route, so I contacted one of them and booked him to drive my Dad 30 miles south to the nearest good hospital while we drove 30 miles east to meet him there. Dad’s nurse got him into the Uber somehow, and we rushed to hospital watching the Uber car on the map also make its way there. We met in the hospital parking lot and my hubby got Dad into the ER while I paid the driver and added a 40$ tip. Dad collapsed in the ER within minutes of arriving (septic shock) and was in hospital for a week before going to rehab and back home. 
So Brian, wherever you are, THANK YOU for saving my Dad. We are so grateful to you.","Edit: I agree that Uber shouldn’t be an ambulance, and I felt bad about the poor Uber driver with my sick Dad although he told us he just slept the whole way. But we just didn’t have any other option!! If we could get an ambulance to transport from a house, we would- every service that one can contract in our area will only pick up from an institution (hospital, nursing home, etc.) not a house. Health care system here needs help- my family in India is appalled at what we go through. You can surely call the Uber driver and thank him in person - give more tip, for example.

Meanwhile Uber is really becoming the new Ambulance these days - not for your case where the closest hospital was 1 hour away , but a lot folks live in non-rural area with real Ambulance service available minutes away are instead using Uber for their medical emergencies. Wow, violent opinions on all sides. Some points that may help answer concerns:
We were quite clear on the situation with the Uber driver so he didn’t go into the arrangement blindly. 
Dad’s nurse’s assessment was that he needed medical care in a hospital setting, but wasn’t in immediate risk of dying. She is an excellent nurse, so we trusted her input. Dad being Dad he apparently was sicker than we knew. 
If Dad has gone by squad to the local community hospital he would have died. Again, no medical transport is available from a home to a hospital where we live - we had already called every transport company within 50 miles. 
Mom died a year ago- not quite sure why one angry person is bringing her into the discussion. Dad continued to live in their home on a country road in the middle of fields and trees because that was where he wanted to live and we did our best to help him do that with nursing and church support.
Just to wrap things up for those who asked Dad did live alone for another few months, then moved in with us. He died May 10th- just in time to get to heaven to see Mom for Mother’s Day. 
I am very grateful to our Uber driver and just wanted to share how kind he was and how everything seemed to come together. wish more stories like this would make the news You do you man , it’s a good judgement call and all that matter is your dad is okay, I applaud that Uber driver ... to everyone else, don’t talk shit until you come into a situation like this .. ethics and moral will go to hell when it comes to a matter of life and death of a family member Ubers are faster than an ambulance these days, and that's kinda sad. 

Very glad to hear Brian was able to help save your father!! Kudos Brian It sounds like your dad may need to more somewhere with vaguely adequate medical care As a paramedic, please don't do this.  We're not limited to only the closest hospital, and him going into respiratory arrest in the Uber would have been bad.  I can also help treat septic shock and prevent end-organ damage.  30 minutes matters. Most people just need a ride to the ER for minor emergencies which don't require ambulance care. That's cool. As a driver, if they are bleeding out, fuck that!!!  I'll call 911 for you. Uber is really important utility and as a driver I get to make a difference in people’s lives. Edit: thanks for the advice to send an additional tip- we did this and it was positively received.

Do Uber Eats drivers get tipped often?,8,78.18751442371419,uber,"There’s usually a 50c Deliver Fee plus Service Free (usually about 1.50 to 2.00). 

It makes me wonder if Uber eats drivers make money.","Lol.... nope I always tip a few bucks on UberEats orders (more if a big order or a long drive). Only exception is if there is a problem (e.g. driver is using somebody else's account) Uber Eats drivers can get tipped more than Uber Express Pool or Uber Pool drivers. Uber X, Uber Comfort, Uber Select, etc drivers will likely get more tips than the others combined. It all depends on your area though. If you are outside a large urban area, your mileage may significantly vary. I have never been tipped driving Uber Eats. I also noticed Uber Eats does not make as much. Sometimes I made $6 in 25 minutes. This is especially true in cities where parking is scarce. You might take 10 minutes just to park and walk to pickup the meal! I would avoid Uber Eats in the city unless you have a bike or an electric scooter I always tip Uber Eats I get tipped 3/4 of the time Uber is riping off all its (employees) drivers..."
How to get proper invoice with full name?,5,78.29855609038086,uber,"Is there any way to get PROPER invoice documents from UBER, suitable for reimbursements as business expenses?

So far I do this: My trips > Details > Resend Receipt. 

This sends me a mail with no attachment and with a summary of the trip, fare and tip.

This mail does not have my full name, only my first name at the beginning in ""Thanks for riding, XXX"". This is not a proper invoice.

The invoice needs to have my full name to be acceptable, it doesn't need to have the mugshot of the driver, doesn't need to have marketing blurb at the end (""Invite your friends and family"") or the big ""Rate or Tip"" button. Ideally it would be a PDF. 

As it is it's just not a professional invoice, it's just an informal summary email. My expense dept is not accepting this (mainly for the name).

Any one knows how to get decent invoices?","If you use concur you can enable e-receipt integration.  Otherwise, my Fortune 100 company accepts the receipts as is.  What country are you in?  I’m in the US. Can you also include a screen shot of the ride from your Uber app that proves you took the ride? After digging more in the help pages, I found out that Uber only send proper invoices (as opposed to simple receipts) for Premium rides. (SELECT, BLACK, and SUV), not for UberX or car pool.

At the end of the day, fuck it, it’s not my credit card. Usually when this happens they just haven't changed the keyboard back to English I have had rider names in Chinese but never a text message. Try [Google Translate](https://www.google.com/search?q=google%20translate%20chinese%20to%20english) (next time, of course). In Hawaii, drivers pick up a lot of Japanese and Korean passengers. The pickups are a tad more likely to be fraught with problems, but the rides are generally good. Did anyone else make a Q-Bert sound in your mind when reading that, or was that just me? ""i am here"" I got one of those too from a pax in Santa Monica. I'm not sure the pax know there's no built-in translator.

Ordering drive through on Uber Eats,10,78.79197044225755,uber,"I've seen a lot of drivers talk about pax asking to go through the drive through during the ride.

So here's a question for passengers who do that:
Would you order your food on Uber Eats for it to get picked up during your ride, if it means your order can be processed faster and your driver will be paid fairly for the extra work?

Drivers:
Would you like this feature since you will get paid more (essentially a trip plus half a delivery) or hate it since you'll get food in the car?","There’s no way to accept two jobs at once. 

If there was, it would end up being a mess as one driver could get the PAX and another get the food. 

Best option, charge $1 min wait time, and drivers would wait as long as you want. It’s high enough to curb abuse by crummy passengers and would make tough conversations go away. Also bullshit stops would be self solving. 

“PAX: I put in this stop, I’ll only be in here a min, im going to try to make you wait here by leaving my crap in your car”

15 mins later no pax.

Call: immediately they say I’m coming. And hang up. 

15 mins later still no pax.

Vs 

“PAX: I put in this stop, I’ll only be in here a min, im going to try to make you wait here by leaving my crap in your car”

“Me: that’s fine, take as long as you want, they are charging you $1 a min”

“PAX: Oh, then I’ll just end the ride here and get another one when I’m done.”

“ME: that’s also fine.” No. I drive and don’t allow food in my car, so no drive throughs ever. I offer to cancel if they’d prefer a restaurant experience vs a safe ride from point A to point B. I don’t mind going to a drive-through as long as the pax says “I’ll buy you whatever you like”. I had one say, “Don’t be shy about it. Buy anything you want man!  I’m sure you’re hungry at this time of the night!” I get tipped as well. 

If pax asks and don’t offer, I say “Sorry, I don’t do drive-throughs. I’ll miss rides while sitting in long queues”. 

I never had a complaint about food odors. Pax would keep the bag closed and never eat in my car even though I haven’t instructed them not eat in the car. 

I ask Uber drivers if they don’t mind going to a drive-through. If they have no problem, I’ll cheerfully follow up and tell them to buy whatever you like!"

Bad streak of passive aggressive drivers (ratings),28,78.86410007189822,uber,So a few weeks ago my Uber rating stayed around 4.85 but ever since then it's been going down currently at 4.79. I don't know why all of a sudden it's going down bad streak of drivers? A few of these trips were pool most were regular rides. I mainly sit in the back and most of the drivers seemed friendly and the conversions seem normal so what gives?,"The common denominator here is you. Driver here. I’d pick up a 4.79 no problem. Don’t stress about it. Probably something about you or your actions. 

Are you telling them, “I’ll tip you in the app?” 4.85 is Also kinda bad. Who gives a shit what some uber drivers think of you? 95% of drivers will pick up any rating. Btw drivers are a lot of the times awful. I cant tell you how many drivers have a worse rating than I do as a not so great passenger lol. Anyone 4.62 or higher i usually pick up Probably just statistical noise. If you peruse this sub a bit you'll see that it is full of disgruntled drivers who downrate their clients for all manner of trivial offenses--talked too much, didn't talk enough, ride was too short, ride was too long, wrong color shirt, etc. (Of course the same drivers think it is grievously unfair for a passenger to rate her or her driver anything less than a 5 for anything short of serious bodily injury to the passenger.) You probably just happened to randomly encounter a number of such drivers in a row. My rating always goes up after I take some trips in Latin America You want to have a great rating tip up front This is actually an application in prejudice.  When drivers see my amazing 4.93 rating they know I'm a good pax before they even meet me.  And since they know I'm a good pax I turn out to be a good pax so I'm rated 5 stars obviously.  But you.  You have a pathetic 4.79 rating.  They know you are sometimes a jerk though maybe not always.  And that means if something bad happens during the ride it was probably because you did something to cause that.  As you are the kind of person to do that.  So they rate you 3 or 4 stars.  Unfortunately it is nearly impossible to get out of the feedback death spiral.  I did it but it was very expensive and took 6 months of my life.  Just create a new account and hope your first 10 drivers give you no more than one sub 5 star rating. when uber forces a pool on me or tricks me into picking up a pool rider, I rate all the riders with a 1 star automatically, even if they gave me a neck massage during the ride."
Charged a cancellation fee for ending a ride when a driver wouldn't hang up a facetime call,5,78.89190099783794,uber,"Driver picked me up and after driving off of my block, they answered a loud video call. Noise notwithstanding, video calls are illegal in my state while driving. He said offhand that someone was having a birthday party. I asked him to pull over and let me out. He initially tried to keep driving but I adamantly repeated to pull over and let me out. He said that he would but he wasn't going to cancel and that I should cancel. I got out and saw that he hadn't ended the ride but was still driving so not knowing what to do to stop the ride, I cancelled it.

When I messaged Uber that I got out because he wouldn't get off the phone, I was sent a standard message about the cancellation fee kicking in after a couple of minutes as if I didn't get in the car to begin with.

I've previously only encountered a cancellation fee when I didn't get in a car, not a ride that I was in the process of. How can I get Uber to fix this?","Report for safety violation instead of a cancellation fee issue Uber uses bots to answer email. If you want to prevail, just email them over and over until you reach a human with a couple of brain cells. Video offence next time report the ride as a safety issue instead of disputing the cancellation fee Part 1 - report ride as a safety issue and tell support about distracted driving. 

Part 2 - did the ride ride get you X% of the ride from point A to Point B, was the cost of the ride X% of the cost to go from point A to Point B?

Like if the ride should have cost $10 to go the full way, and you got out half way there, were you charged more than $5 for that ride?"

Will Uber suspend my account if I fall about 4.6 rating?,6,79.04273433117955,uber,"So I am new and only have 19 trips under my belt. So far I have gotten 9 five star ratings and 1 one star rating. Why would someone just randomly give me one star? I haven't made a wrong turn, I am a pretty effecient driver from my time delivering food/items before. I greet riders and try to feel the vibe if they wanna talk, if they do, I make small talk (Got a great conversation compliment badge thing)and that's about it.

 I don't know, I feel bummed out about the 1 star rating because I heard Uber can suspend accounts and I am enjoying it. I wanted to spruce up my car a bit for the riders too.",Dont worry till your past 100 trips The one stars will come out of nowhere from time to time with no explanation. Could be anything from people trying to get free rides to prejudice. Dont worry about it right now. Hit that 500 ride milestone and reassess your standing. Random people one star you for any reason or no reason. Don't sweat it. You won't be deactivated for rating this early on. They will send you to Europe for a finishing school. I got 2 random 1 stars out of 100 rides and 40 people rating my rides. Pick up a pax with a low rating and assume they’ll give you a low rating. It would be cool if uber gave automatic 5 stars to you for people who don’t rate instead they act like those rides don’t matter.

Just waiting for a ride @ the DIA lot this afternoon.,2,79.0497366460054,uber,Image,It's raining?
Rear ended as a passenger -- probably in a scam. please help.,28,79.1351996089794,uber,"My friend ordered an Uber, and when the guy shows up, he wants one of us to sit in the front seat. I wind up sitting down, and I notice his tank is empty. I tell my friend, let's get a different car, the tank is empty, and the guy is like no, we'll make it fine, or you can help me out with gas. My friend is like, that's fine. He is drunk, and I'm like, whatever, that's on you then. 

We get going, and I hear a 20 minute long sob story, the guy contradicts why he was picking us up from an affluent area saying it was on his way home, but our destination was the opposite of his ""home."" He proceeds to miss our exit, then stop short and get rear ended on a 6 lane freeway, conveniently right where the two three lanes merge, so we are trapped in the car between 6 lanes of traffic. The car that hit us has a woman driving who immediately comes up to the car and goes straight to the guy and says ""are you okay"" and he'd already been complaining about his back problems, and he says ""ohhh, my back"" and they he gets out and goes to the back of the car with him. Now alone in the car, I'm telling my friend, this is a scam, we need to get out of here, something bad is going to happen, and after 10 minutes he gets back in, no cops arrive and we continue toward our destination. Before leaving, he keeps telling me to get his phone from under my seat, and my friend said ""I can direct you from here"" after I said no, just drive. I now realize they were probably colluding to whatever they were going to do next, and were listening to our conversation. 

I recorded the rest of the ride, about 10 minutes, and then we got out and left. My friend refuses to tell Uber what happened or follow any protocol, because I'm thinking he thinks his parents will turn off his account, or he's being stubborn because I was right. My car was parked in his driveway, and the only angle I can possibly figure is that he's going to say I rear ended him, hit and ran, and then give my license plate number. If anyone has any other ideas what the scam is here, let me know. 

I'm absolutely suffering PTSD right now from being held hostage in this terrifying situation, and knowing this guy is a scam artist, and it doesn't seem like the scam is complete. What the fuck do I do here? My friend won't tell me the guy's name, the account, anything. I feel like he had me in the passenger seat, and wanted me to grope around on the floor after the accident for some reason -- maybe to leave my DNA? Maybe the car is going to be used to commit a crime? I don't know. I'm terrified and I want to know what to do to protect myself, even though I was just a passenger, and as far as I know, he doesn't have my name -- but I guess my license plate would give that away if he has a way to find that. 

What do I do here?","deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2935  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/74341) you sound crazy

unless something has actually impacted you as a result of this ride-- who cares? Sorry-- not buying your PTSD nonsense either. Next time-- don't get in the car and get your own ride. I know you think it's a scam but what do the voices in your head say? This story makes no sense, i cant even follow it. It sounds like you think your friend and this driver know each other and that there was never any uber ride to begin with, all to stage some elaborate crash hoax by getting a 3rd party to smash into the rear end ON THE FREEWAY, yadda yadda yadda. I dont think the CIA could even plan this attack. And then you're worried it somehow all revolves around you because.... because.... reasons? I really wouldn’t worry about it. Sounds like he exchanged insurance information with the other driver and then finished your route. If randomly pointing at cars and saying “oh they hit me” we’re a things, we’d all be constantly having to deal with false accusations. It’s easy enough to prove that a car wasn’t involved in an accident. Remember too that there is an exact record of where and how long the trip was. That was one wild dream buddy, you should lay off [INSERT DRUG HERE]. You are out of your mind. Im pretty sure you have mental problems, and should see someone about it. You need to seek a mental health professional. Follow the money. It can be an injury insurance fraud. It doesn't matter who's at fault, the insurance company have to pay out for injury claims which can be hundred thousands of millions of dollars. You may be there just to witness a collision. If you guys seem to buy it, they may call the cops and take your statements. They can still make the claim without you.

Or  the other girl just want to write off her car and buy new one. Typically the car that got written off it's not the actual car that was hit.

You can file a request for police report at the local  chp in CA for example. The report will ID all parties involved in the accident. They are likely to call the police after you were gone for insurance purposes."
Getting boned by Uber support: is there anything that can be done?,57,79.16326673860904,uber,"My girlfriend went out to brunch with friends the other day, and when they left, it was pouring; needless to say, they all got soaked. 
  
They called an Uber (from my GF's account) and had an uneventful ride home. Flash forward to today and she gets charged an $80 ""cleaning fee"". When she asks for proof, Uber support responds with photos of of the car's seats that (if you look *very* closely) appear to be slightly damp. 
  
Support then credited her with $5 towards her account. (Credited back because she tipped him $5)
  
It was raining. The passengers were wet, and all across the country uber drivers are picking up users during and immediately after rain showers. 
  
What course of action can she take to not be taken advantage of?
  
What is stopping me from signing up to drive for Uber, driving exclusively on rainy days, and taking a picture of water on my seats to take advantage of customers for a little extra spending money?
  
She's fuming, I'm fuming, and everyone involved are not likely to be using Uber or similar services ever again now that this precedent has been set.
  
Edit: pictures I was given, be warned it's a screenshot of a screenshot. If I'm in the wrong here definitely say so $80 Uber cleaning fee after being picked up in the rain https://imgur.com/gallery/VBPPCL8","$80 is ridiculous, I've only ever gotten $20 from support when rain soaked pax get my car wet You have to look at it from the driver's perspective. What if he went to pick up his next passenger who happened to be heading to a formal event, and that passenger took care to bring an umbrella or be picked up somewhere that was dry, only to hop into the backseat of a car and get their clothes wet? They'd be probably be at the very least a bit upset.

 

Sometimes rain is unavoidable, but that doesn't mean it's ok to soak someone's seat and have them deal with the clean up and/or consequences of it. You have to leave an Uber in the same condition you entered it.

 

Personally, I have a towel handy and pleather seats that dry off instantly, but I can imagine a seriously soaked cloth seat taking quite a while to dry - Long enough to keep this driver from being able to pick up more people and make money. That’s insane. Dispute with bank. That photo looks clean to me I hear they don’t charge you a damage fee if you fuck up your own car. $80 does seem excessive though you have to admit it's nearly impossible to determine how wet a seat is in a picture.    

To answer your question, if you drove exclusively on rainy days and turned in fees constantly you'd lose the ability to turn in cleaning fees. Uber does have a limit / threshold based on a reasonable average to prevent abuse like that. I have refused to allow riders get into my car when ""soaked"". That is when the shit storm begins. Threats and expletives come pouring down. If you get caught in the open in a downpour, you could be  SOOL. I will not carry plastic around to cover my leather seats. She got the car wet, it needed to be cleaned before the next dry pax got in. She should take ownership of what she did.

You can dispute the charge and probably win with the CC company, and then be banned from Uber. This is clearly bullshit and unethical behavior by the driver -- and also bullshit and unethical behavior by the idiots who do customer service for Uber. If you are driving an Uber (a taxi), you need to be prepared for your car to get wet when it's raining -- if that's a problem, put plastic over your seats when it rains.

Given Uber's customer service is absolutely appalling -- something like human bots -- it will be hard to resolve this.

A few ideas:

1. Continue demanding a full refund of the $80 (i.e. the remaining $75) via the ""Help"" feature on the app. Keep making the case over and over again. Maybe she'll get lucky.
2. Use Twitter to contact Uber Support and, again, make the case for the absurdity of being charged $80 for a slightly damp seat. (If this doesn't resolve the situation, demand via Twitter that the issue be ""escalated."")
3. Reach out to one of these email addresses: [https://www.elliott.org/company-contacts/uber/](https://www.elliott.org/company-contacts/uber/). Include the picture and also a link proving it was raining at the time.
4. Send new Help messages in Spanish -- I've found the Spanish customer support agents are more reasonable and professional than the English-speaking agents.

I think your girlfriend will get the money back -- maybe even an extra $20 of credit, too -- but it will be frustrating and annoying, and she will need to make it a little ""game."" Honestly just don't stop messaging support and eventually they will refund the money.   
This is obviously a bullshit claim on the driver's side based on those pictures but even if you are soaking wet the driver could have just refused the pick up if wet seats bother them that much. Had they had dirty clothes and dirt got on the seats mixed with rain then that's a different story.  
Either way keep contacting them and they will eventually cave. Uber doesn't pay you if you take trips immediately after the 'mess'. Uber/Lyft rainy Seattle driver here. This sounds pretty lame on the driver’s part if it all happened as you describe. Unfortunately I doubt there’s much to be done at this point as far as recouping the money. 

My only suggestion would for her to keep an eye on the driver rating of anyone she hails, and cancel on anyone below a 4.9. 

Also perhaps documenting any similar situations moving forward (taking photos sounds silly but it can be a life saver) and even acknowledging it with the driver in the future if she’s worried about it becoming an issue.

Us drivers aren’t all bad. Hopefully this doesn’t dissuade you and her from using ride share in the future. It doesn’t matter how that looks like. When your seat is wet, that means you cannot drive longer that day, and that is time and money that the driver loses.

Every passenger has to take responsibility for their actions. It’s so easy to not paying attention to these details when the car is not yours.

A good rider would think this first. Good luck next time. is 80 dollars egregious? yes.
but so is getting a 115 dollar ticket in manhattan because your passenger was running late, decided they couldn’t wait in traffic and jumped out of your car in the middle of a busy street instead of waiting for you to pull next to the curb.

we still don’t have protections against that mind you. and we don’t have the luxury of calling the city for a refund even though it isn’t our fault.

the fee isn’t just for damages. it’s a lesson to teach you to be more considerate. yes it’s a bit much. but you’d have come here to complain even if it was a 10 dollar cleaning fee. you don’t fully appreciate the service you were provided and what it means for someone to provide it."

Yep.  Just make sure that person has the info of the driver.  Also be aware, that if you friend screws up or creates a bad time for the driver, your account is going rated poorly. Better idea, have them make/use their own account. That way you don’t keep paying for their one star. 

I one star people who make me babysit drunks. If they need your help to get in a car, they will need help out of a car and may be passed out and can’t get woken up. At that point, I have to decide if I have to get the cops or a paramedic to get them up. 

I don’t touch pax. 

Also, having a set of extra eyes on them might help stop or warn me to pull over when the drunk starts to puke. 

That can save you $150 clean up fee. 

If they are obviously drunk, let them keep hanging on at your place, then send them home when they are just a little drunk.

Acceptance Rate Issues,11,79.30257229417838,uber,"I've finally earned enough ""points"" to qualify for Gold level. I'm hoping to start attending the online university, which would be completely paid for by uber.

Here's the rub: they say my acceptance rate is 84%, and 85% is the minimum threshold to qualify. When I go to the acceptance rate section, it says I accepted 66 rides and rejected ZERO. I can't get support to understand why that should be 100%. It also says the dates are June 16th to July 16th. Shouldn't this be a rolling total that changes day to day? It certainly used to be.

I'm thinking of taking uber to arbitration over this scam. I did a single day, accepting literally all the garbage they sent, and made $5 per hour, in order to raise my acceptance rate. I feel very cheated. Does anyone know the process for requesting arbitration? Driver support is, as usual, useless.","Mine hasn’t updated since July 16. I swear I also remember it updating daily. They must have changed something it seems. besides the whole acceptance rate thing-- you probably should read the fine print about the ASU online -- it is by no means free and requires you to have given over 3000 rides on Uber for starters. There are other requirements-- the whole thing is total BS used by Uber to make themselves look like some great deal without actually having to pay for anything. To be fair-- none of the partner rewards are worth a shit imo. 


but hey-- good luck with all of that. There seems to be some issues with the acceptance and cancel rates lately, as mine haven't updated in a week. >  I did a single day, accepting literally all the garbage they sent, and made $5 per hour

lmfao. You reduced your hourly earnings to roughly 1/3rd the standard rate just so you could have the luxury of knowing you are going to continue making $5/hour. Goddamn the guy at uber who proposed this plan deserves a raise. Uber won’t even let me hit gold. I’m not even joking I am very close to gold and the past 4 nights I spent 4 hours online each night and got one Ride per night. I was even in an area that was surging $14 for 20 minutes. When I asked why they said because I was in low demand areas and that I needed to drive in busier areas. I was in the only area that was surging at that particular time. Now I’m screwed because in order for me to be able to survive and make bills I need to make $400 per week I don’t even want to do their scholarship program I just want to make the money I usually make.

Can a driver accept rides while still driving another passenger?,48,79.37235238678201,uber,"I’m a rider and recently I ordered an Uber while they still were dropping a passenger off. I didn’t want to leave a bad review until I figured out whether this was a feature of the app or if it was the drivers fault. Thanks!
Edit: please read the comments responding to the negative ones before downvoting, thanks!","Yes. If the area is busy enough and the algorithm detects that a driver will be ending a ride close to a new request, it will offer the ride to the driver and notify the waiting passenger that the driver is finishing a ride and should be to you soon.

It is a feature and a good thing because it gets that driver to you faster than bringing another one in from farther away. Not the drivers fault! Yes, it's perfectly normal and if it happened it means you got a ride faster than you would have otherwise.     

Anyway, why would you leave a bad review? Did the driver get you from point A to point B safely? If the app is telling you they’re still on another ride, do you really think it’s some con the driver is able to pull off to screw you specifically? Jw Completely normal and common during high demand times. I’ve been able to accept rides while in the middle of a ride but I don’t find out where the next rider is until I drop the first rider off. Fucking fuck, what will pax complain about next? ITS A FEATURE OF THE APP that we get offered rides if we are dropping someone off close to the requested ride. Why would you endanger a persons livelihood for such a trivial matter? Even if it weren’t a feature of the app what is the problem ? The way we make money is to go from ride to ride and not wait in between. Have some human understanding for goodness sakes!! LYFT simply adds people to your queue automatically as you are driving . Please don’t consider adversely affecting a persons livelihood just because you have an ego problem. Read the post and the comments and still can't figure out why you would even think to give the driver a bad rating. Did you get where you wanted to go safely? Good. Everything else is none of your business."

TL;DR uber support is confusing, what do i do. please help","Sorry to say it might be easier just to get a new number.

Or a number specifically for Uber.

 This sooner or later is going to screw uber over if the numbers aren't being recycled back and after a certain amount of inactivity I had that and emailed them that i got a new number my phone number had actually been blacklisted so whoever had my number before got kicked off Uber. But they quickly changed it when i proved i was Michelle and not Edward. ""What the hell do I do?""

If i make tiny money from the uber lawsuit do I still have to report to my tax guy or irs?,5,79.52479451642269,uber,"The money is little, is it something I still have to file. its not even 200 dollars or anything. i previously talked to my tax guy and he told me i didn't have to even file my work with uber last year since the miles, time worked, and money was little especially after uber took the expenses.","Lawsuits are usually tax exempt I would maybe check with another ""tax guy"" - yours doesn't sound very competent I doubt your Tax guy said don’t report anything. 

That is if your “tax guy” is a tax guy. Uncle Buck is not a tax guy. 

Reporting income is a requirement. 

Reporting millage is easy enough, it could help you in other ways. 

If your “Tax Guy” is actually your tax guy, go find a new tax guy. 


That said, I doubt you need to worry about how much taxes you will pay from a settlement any time soon unless you somehow got hit by another Uber driver who was 100% at fault. > i didn't have to even file my work with uber last year since the miles, time worked, and money was little especially after uber took the expenses.

Why do uber drivers downrate passengers for short trips when you make more money per minute?,19,79.63977136828832,uber,"Just as an example, my short 4 minute trip to the metro costs almost $6 while my 20+ minute trip to a far-away park costs just over $13. That's more than double dollars per minute, yet I've seen numerous threads saying drivers rate passengers lower for short trips. Any reasonable explanation?","Short trips don't bother me too much, they're a quick and easy way to qualify for promotions usually.  

I'll give a 1\* for extremely short trips, when it's evident the person is just being extremely lazy and it's taken me longer to get to the pickup than to do the trip itself.

The shortest trip I've done is about 300m, literally from one end of a street to the other.  Chick was ""lol I couldn't be bothered walking"". * I typically can't do more than 4 short trips per hour, as I'll usually have to drive 2 or 3 miles (or more) to the next pickup location between trips.  The money's not great in this situation.
* I don't get paid for the dead miles with no passenger in the car.  If you're going a short distance, it's entirely possible that I drove further to pick you up than I get paid to drive with you in the car.  When this happens, it's arguable as to whether I break even or lose money on the trip.
* The most money made per hour is a trip that has me driving at Interstate speed for the whole hour, covering the maximum number of miles possible.  The highest paying weekends for me include more than one 60+ minute trip to an NYC airport. A better question is, if this is a problem, why doesn't Uber charge some minimum flat fee plus milage to take short trips disproportionately more money and more worth while for drivers? I can't speak for everyone but sorry trips are a hassle when completed to longer trips. You may not receive a ping right away,v you have to go in them up, hope it goes smoothly (half the time there's some issue with the person either not being ready or not at the pin, etc). Of course there's no tip. Then it all starts again with another short trip. Cause majority of Uber drivers are lazy pieces of shit that have no skills in life and want to make most money while working less We don't rate passengers lower for short trips.

We also don't make more money per minute for shorter trips. We're paid the same rate no matter what, unless there's surge. The rate for my area is $0.12 a minute, but $0.62 a mile, so drivers prefer longer trips.

We actually make less though, way less, for shorter trips. A 1.2 mile ride in the inner city rush hour traffic, that might take 10-15 minutes, we make $3.00. But a 10 mile trip that involves the highway at highway speeds, might take the same 10-15 minutes, but we make $10-$12 on that trip. We make more because we get paid more per mile.

What we do rate passengers low for: sweaty, dirty, weird, rude people going 0.6 miles, that either talk your head off or say absolutely nothing at all, and don't leave a tip. > short trips when you make more money per minute

Because you're wrong. Our rates dont fluctuate, we make the same amount per minute and per mile no matter what. When you factor in the time it took to come get you, the time it takes to drop you off, and the potential that we lost a much better paying ride then short trips piss us off. They basically make $0 after all expenses and sometimes even cost us money where we might make -$1 for example."
Uber Scam,30,80.05421581273278,uber,This happened today in Denver. Pull up to hotel indigo to pick up Tyler. Receive phone call from passenger claiming to be Uber representative. Says this isn’t an actual ride but a test to make sure that it’s me driving and not someone else using my account. They knew my license plate number/car make and model/rating/trip count and asked me to verify my phone number as they were going to hang up and call me to make sure that it is really me. They call me back and say I will receive a $25 credit for this trip and thank me for being who I say I am stating that Denver has had multiple complaints about drivers letting friends or family drive for them. They then proceed to tell me since I am a diamond driver and haven’t had any issues that I will be receiving a $600 bonus. The guy on the phone tells me to go to my account balance page to see if I have received it and I tell him no. He tells me not to worry that sometimes this happens and that he’ll be providing me with a 16 digit card number that I’ll need to add under instant pay. I’m thinking weird but I haven’t given this guy anything other than my phone number so there’s still a little array of hope. After I punch in the card number he tells me to hit cash out. I tell him that will send you my money that won’t send me the bonus. He tries to tell me that it refreshes my account and the money will be in there after I cash out. I told him he’s all set. I was two clicks away from sending away my weekly earnings. Sounds dumb but maybe if I was older or wasn’t thinking clearly at the moment he could have gotten me. Looking back there were some red flags but up until that last step it all sounded pretty legit. Wish I would have saved his 16 digit card number.,"When this happens and it’s an obvious scam, just start the trip and drive around. Take yourself to lunch, go for a nice drive, whatever. They won’t reach out to support to correct it because they know they’re caught. Did you report the passenger to Uber? It happened to me too!  Tried to post about it here but you beat me to it! I put the card number and everything, till he said cash out, I said “done” but I haven’t and he said, ok I will call you in a second!” and he gone lmao The red flag was they pretended to be Uber offering you extra cash. Uber never offers that. If you are changing/updating your debit card , you will not be allowed to cash out for 72 hours. 
Uber never calls you, just like the IRS.

Uber will call you in rare instances when you are accused of something or you are accusing your rider of something. Before they initiate the call, they will send you a message through the app. This has happened up me 4 times now, first time I almost believed him and ended up saying  fine deactivate my account then if that's what you have to do. Then called uber, now I just taunt them and tell them thanks for the 5 bucks! Good luck in prison!  

There has been a surge in such complaints: This sounds like Uber driver Dbase was hacked or possibly accessed internally but fraudulently  - as in a present or former employee running/perpetuating this scam. Hey, shit happens. Uber would not be the first.

Anyone out there getting any call from Uber, beware, and always ask which office and location they are with and what is a good local phone number you can call them back on - before you discuss ANYTHING. Wait 10-15 minutes before you call back. There are apps for cell phones that use rotating burner numbers that you can use for phone verification type stuff (emails too) but they have a time limit - usually 10-15 minutes.

This is just SOP doing business by phone with ANYONE and someone unknown to you pops up. It's dead easy to spoof a phone number, it's a little more difficult to commandeer a phone number for more than about 15 minutes.

As an additional step, if necessary, (anything financial) check the phone number you are given v. google to see if it comes up as a listed phone for whoever it is that claims they are calling to discuss business with you. I had somthing very  similar  happen..i was told i would be getting paid 25 dollars  to verify  my id...i did not do it...the passenger  canceled  the ride....but for a day or two I was  nervous  uber was going to deactivate  me... they didn't,  it was a scam Why would Uber need you to give them your phone number I got scammed by an Uber driver with the cleaning fee. I know there’s a charge for spills and throwing up, but I was charged $150 for throwing up, but let me explain. I had to puke to I opened the Uber’s door and got all outside, except like a drip on the carpet. When I get out she looked at it and told me “I don’t see anything, don’t worry it’s all fine.” Then the next day I was charged $150. Now I know I threw up and was willing to pay what was reasonable, and if you look on Uber’s own website, it clearly states that throwing up is $80, and only if you profusely vomit in between the window and hard to clean places it is $150. It’s just the Uber drivers word vs mine and Uber always sides with the driver. I have a picture of it but don’t know if I can add pics here Scumbags are everywhere even in this sub.  If it's too good to be true, it probably is! Man, I’m so glad you posted this! This is like the fourth post *this weekend*, but yeah, thanks! i’m trying to post a photo on this sub but its not working.. uber driver dropped me from his car because i had promo code.. he also refused to cancel the trip and i couldn’t pick another uber.. i
had to walk a long distance then"

When booking a ride on the app and it says the price next to the car is that for the maximum amount of ripple each car can hold or the price per person?,8,80.29289636831041,uber,Like if it says $20 and I have 5 people riding is that $20 per person or $20 per car,"It's per vehicle. You need to specify one of the XL options if you're going to need room for 5 though. With 5 people make sure you book an Uber XL as you won't fit inside an Uber X.

The only time the number of people matters is when you're booking a Pool trip, then you can choose whether you're riding by yourself or with another person. I've seen people travel with a friend and they book a Pool trip for 1 person to save money, resulting in the car going over capacity."
Holy Hell does Philadelphia have the worst drivers and trashiest cars of any city I've ever seen using Uber for years now .....,28,80.29478294239829,uber,"I've used Uber a lot of major citoes on the east coast but my god, the cars I've seen and the smells......this is just ridiculous.","You haven’t had me drive you around yet. \>**Holy Hell does Philadelphia have the worst drivers**

\*Laughs in Boston\* Philadelphia is a class I city, and has it's own TLC/TNC licensing, separate from the rest of the state.  Oh yeah, and it's a shit hole. I drive in philly, I always get compliments on how clean my car is, maybe my fellow drivers are setting the bar low because I mostly just bang out the floor mats once a week and vaccum it maybe once a month. \*\*\* Orlando has entered the chat. You get what you pay for if the fare is super cheap expect a super cheap ride As a driver in a part of Pennsylvania that Philly sends their public housing rejects to, I've had to stop doing Lyft because they're the only ones who use it here. Uber is generally more pleasant to use in Europe, Asia, or Latin America. That said, within the United States, my best Uber experiences have been in California, the Southwest, the Pacific Northwest, and the Mountain states. (But, really, I think customer service/quality -- across services -- is better in those places than the East Coast, so...) try ordering a Select car instead It's a big ghetto... what do ya expect lol You get what you pay for. What's your rating? Could be an explanation. Uh, excuse you.

I'm from Philly and we drive sanely. Only issue you'd have is if you're the insane one.

Trashiest cars is *probably* because people are low income and you're being an asshole."
Removing stain tips?,5,80.3065074794436,uber,Anyone have any suggestions on how to remove old drink spilled stains from seats ?  ( Honda Civic),Super Clean degreaser or Resolve spray Buy some 'Awesome' at the dollar store. Buy a car backseat blanket that is permanently put in place.  No need to remove the stain
Suggestion for those in Uber customer service hell: speak Spanish,9,80.45893803499915,uber,"I was in customer service hell for a little less than a week. My driver's car died during a ride and I was forced to pay \*extra\* for the privilege of canceling and being stranded. After days of back and forth with the outsourced English-speaking customer service agents, I switched to Spanish last night and engaged with Uber's Spanish-speaking agents. Shockingly, after a few messages, my issue was finally resolved.

While this may have just been a coincidence that my customer service concern was finally resolved at the same time, I think it may simply be that the Spanish-speaking agents are better at their jobs and more willing to actually read the concerns submitted by customers, think critically about them, and escalate when necessary. I also found that while the Spanish-speaking agents respond in perfect highly-professional Spanish, the English-speaking agents do not, perhaps suggesting they may struggle to fully understand complaints they are reviewing.

(Perhaps confirming this theory is that a customer service concern I recently had in Central America -- the wrong driver picking me up -- was handled much  more quickly, efficiently, and fairly than it would have been if I was engaging with the English-speaking agents.)

I could be totally wrong, but it's an interesting data point.","I'm glad you got your issue stranded.  


While I wouldn't generalize to say all Spanish speaking agents are better than all English speaking agents, the agents are located in different centers based on where you're calling from and what language you've chosen.

"How likely would it be that i could get an uber to take me from New Port Richie, FL to Disnetworld on a monday in August?",9,80.58546581278797,uber,"Family is doing a vacation in August, and we will be spending some time outside of Tampa. We then will be going to Disney. We could rent a car, but i hate the idea of renting a car for 3 days to have it sit in the disney parking lots. 

How likely would it be that we could get an uber to take is from New Port Richie, Fl or Disney, about a 2 hour ride, and how much would that typically cost us?","I’m sure it wouldn’t be too hard to find a driver. I just ran generic locations through the Uber app, (NPR Aquatics Center to Disney), and it came in at about $115. The price could change depending on time, traffic, and local demand. If you’re worried about it, after you request and get matched with a driver, contact the driver and let them know where you’re going so you’re not wasting each other’s time. 

Secondly, because it is a long trip, please, *please*, **PLEASE!** tip your driver. While you’re paying over $100 for the trip, the driver is **NOT** receiving that whole amount. It’s looking like 100 miles, so in reality the driver would be getting $60-$75 on that trip. On top of that, there’s a chance that they would go back empty, (not from FL, so I can’t say for sure. This is all generalized thinking). Even a small tip of $25 is enough to cover the gas for that trip and make it worthwhile. You can and should schedule the trip in advance. A long trip like that could result in a possible cancellation upon the drivers arrival when they realize how far they have to go and may only have a certain amount of time they have allotted to “Ubering” due to prior engagements etc. Very likely...also if you schedule in advance uber will give you a small discount up to 5 percent. You might consider breaking the trip into two parts -- going from NPR to the Hard Rock Casino for instance which puts you on the outskirts of Tampa and on I-4 -- then requesting a ride from there to Disney. On the way to the Hard Rock-- your driver might even be open to the idea of taking you all the way to Disney and you can change the destination in the app if they are down for that.

although if you set it up as a scheduled ride with the entire trip-- whoever accepts it would probably be indicating that this entire ride works for them. I only mention the breaking it in two as a way to make it more likely to get across Tampa Bay first... and you might even decide to stop for some breakfast and keep the trip split in two since eating at Disney is very expensive. Also -- it sounds like you have some young kids coming with you and breaking that trip in half gives you a chance to use the bathroom for the second part of the trip-- and I think that would be about 1 hour for each leg depending on traffic.

PS-- Before moving to Phoenix 5 years ago, I lived in Tampa for 30 years so I figured I would chime in with my thoughts."
Is tipping necessary?,18,80.77466720167686,uber,"I have a question for drivers. I've recently started taking uber to and from work to my new job, which is starting to get pricy but for now it's my only option. The first few ridess I tipped because they gave great service but as time has gone on I've felt the pressure in my wallet.

Truth is, I just can't afford to tip otherwise I would. 

I always feel badly especially when my driver is awesome. I always always give five stars though and try to be a courteous, clean passenger. 

I just fear somehow this might effect my passenger rating. Does it reflect badly on my as a passenger to drivers?

All insight would be much appreciated, thanks :)","The vast majority of my rides don't tip, and that's fine with me. Especially if I sense a situation like yours. It's not like you're going out drinking/dining/travelling and tipping everyone except the driver-- you're just getting to work.

We have to rate the passenger the second the trip is over, so we don't know if there was a tip or not when we do it. A lot of tips don't show up until the rider has to use the app again. Might be days later.

Give the driver some feedback, though. Nice to know when a rider thought you did a good job. I always appreciate hearing ""thank you, everything was great"" or something like that. Some drivers are going to hate this, but do give the driver a five star rating unless the driver was horrible. (que the ""ratings don't pay the bills"" comments) Personally I always tip. 

Just like in a restaurant, if you don’t have enough to eat and leave a tip then you don’t have enough to go eat there. Tipping is not required but greatly appreciated. The truth is, Uber takes a large percentage of the price you pay. So your $15 ride is maybe a $7 ride for your driver. We are working for tips, just like a server in a restaurant. If someone gives you exceptional service, ideally you'd tip them. 

BUT the majority of riders still don't tip, so don't feel horrible if you can't. Drivers don't (or shouldn't at least) expect a tip. I always hope for one but don't get upset if it doesn't happen. If you can't tip but feel the person did a good job, definitely leave a good review and a compliment. Those ratings do make a difference for an Uber driver who truly cares. Tipping is always optional, but of course it's nice to offer a tip if a driver does a truly exceptional job how long of a drive are you taking? I would say give them a buck in the app to show you had a positive experience. Not a great tip but it will let us know you were happy. And whatever you do-- NEVER say you are tipping in the app. Tip, don't tip -- but that comment is useless to the driver and annoying when it is not followed through on. I'd definitely cut you some slack as I think it's mean to criticize anyone who is just getting by and trying to improve their lot in life.  

Ironically, I'll almost always get a tip from riders who I pick up from a restaurant while still wearing their food service uniform.  On the flip side, I'll only get a tip about half the time when I pick up someone from a mansion that looks like it should be a set for Billions. Is tipping necessary? No, and don’t let people in this sub tel you otherwise.

At the end of the day how you spend your money is completely up to you. 

Is it good to tip? Yup, I always try to tip when possible. But sometimes I can’t tip and sometimes I let them know that I’m struggling with finances and they completely understand. 

Tip what you can and if you can’t it’s ok, just tip when you can. 

Because if you can’t? Then you just can’t. 

It’s your money at the end of the day my friend. 

Life happens and sometimes we can’t chalk up extra money. 

At the end of the day we’re all just trying to make it. I never tip, 4.95 rating Eh...tipping is for suckers Fuck off with this shit post"
Uber drivers are required to take women in labor to hospital,200,80.82437784983604,uber,"From an article about a driver in New York refusing to take a woman in labor:

*"" When Fortune asked Uber for a response, they said that they do not discuss individual driver incidents. They added: ""****Denying service to a passenger in labor is unacceptable: it goes against our code of conduct and the standard of service our riders rely on****.""*

*According to Emily Martin, the general counsel of the National Women’s Law Center in Washington, DC, city and state laws in New York forbid drivers from refusing women in labor.*

*“Uber drivers are bound by the same public accommodation laws that prohibit New York City taxi drivers and car services from discriminating on the basis of pregnancy when deciding who they will pick up - and those laws are a good thing, as they help ensure that not many babies end up being born on New York City sidewalks.”""*

And from Uber's non discrimation policy, try it and **you'll be sacked**:

 *""Such discrimination includes, but is not limited to, any user* ***refusing to provide or accept services*** *based on any of these characteristics. Any user found to have violated this prohibition will* ***lose access to the Uber platform****""*

My stance is I don’t have the training to be a paramedic, I don’t want to be a paramedic, and if you don’t care enough about yourself or your wife to call an ambulance, it’s not my job to get you to think straight. 

I wouldn’t drive a black guy to the hospital after he’s been shot, I won’t drive a Hispanic woman to the hospital after she is projecting vomit like a garden statue after food poisoning, I’m not going to take a white man to the hospital because he is ODing, I’m not taking a gay guy to the hospital after he gets in a car wreck and is slipping in and out of a coma, I’m not driving a Jewish man to the hospital because he poked himself in the eye and is bleeding. 

I’m not avoiding these people because of their skin, race, sexuality, or pregnancy status.

I’m doing it because I don’t want to take on the liability of a medical emergency. 

I am not required to pick up anyone besides ADA service animals.  

And for the sad sacks who are crying I am leaving them on the street, I’m not, I’m leaving them where they were, and she’s could have tried to call EMS. Imagine , you driving , weekend nights where downtown is surging , lots of ride , back to back , averaging $5-10, you are on your second hour , suddenly a pregnant lady , looks distress , she is sweating and do that breathing technique, husband in tow, you know that that the hospital will be in like 2 miles away , she is holding her belly , and her water broke...

Would you take her ? And sacrificing your night , since it’ll be wet seat and you have to clean it before you can take another rider ? 

Or would you lock your door and cancel the ride , and get another ride?"

Uber refusing to give me a price adjustment for driver running meter,56,81.1995167387746,uber,"My Uber ride should have been 4.3 miles based on Google Maps and the driver drove all the way uptown to drive downtown. The ride was over 10 miles. Meanwhile, the driver was ignoring the navigation and missing easy turns. Clearly was gauging the meter. The ride was set for $27.99 and wound up at $51. 

I submitted a price review to Uber who refused to credit me saying, “I'm sorry to hear that the price you were charged was higher than expected and you didn't pay what you agreed to. I know how frustrating this situation can be. Please know that it is certainly not the experience we want you to have while using the app.

In order to help you to get this sorted out, I started to review your trip and account and noticed in our records that you've requested a high number of price adjustments that have resulted in numerous credits and refunds. As a result, I'm unfortunately not able to adjust the fare for this trip.”

This is definitely BS. Anyone ever dealt with this?","i really fail to believe there are that many drivers long hauling above uber's grace mileage that you are repeatedly calling in for price adjustments. I understand in this scenario you are telling the truth but you must have been abusing the platform nickel and diming them for refunds in the past and now you have been flagged. If a trip quote is $10 and you ended up paying $12 dont request a refund, save that card for days like this one. If the driver was missing turns on purpose that’s one thing but honestly Uber’s GPS system seems like it favors long routes over short ones. Recently, as a driver, I was in an unfamiliar area and was just following the Uber GPS. It put me on the highway for 2 miles, hit a ton of traffic and it took 30 min to complete a 5 mile ride. I looked at the trip details later and I had done a giant U shaped route when there was a much faster route available, literal a straight line from point A to B. I could see a fair adjustment so it looked like the rider had complained and been refunded. Since then I have switched to google maps which is soooo much better. But ya, long unnecessary routes happen all the time on the Uber GPS system and Im pretty sure they set it up that way and just hope ppl don’t notice. Yes what that means is your broke ass keep asking for unjustified credits and uber won't put up with your shit anymore. Just take something you can afford like the subway. Not questioning this particular ride but how many rides have you requested to be adjusted and were adjusted? Try writing to one of these email addresses [https://www.elliott.org/company-contacts/uber/](https://www.elliott.org/company-contacts/uber/) yup. riders who don't let Uber fuck them over incessantly -- maybe request a fare adjustment or refund now and then, which is literally approved by Uber -- are punished with this. Uber's behavior is illegal.

in any event, I'm done with using Uber, at least in the United States where the quality of service is now extremely low. i don't want to risk this situation with a huge fare >I'm sorry to hear that the price you were charged was higher than expected and you didn't pay what you agreed to

If you're paranoid over this, you have bigger issues in your life to deal with What's the problem?

>someone has been using my house address to get picked up by uber

That's not really a problem. I put a pin on my neighbor's house as a pickup point because half the time, due to how my house is situated, the drivers end up on the street behind my house (even food delivery drivers, especially new ones, have trouble). Its easier to use my neighbor's house. heh. half the time I ask for a pickup at my house using 'use my location' my pickup ends up across the street or 3 doors down and around the corner.

&#x200B;

If you request a ride indoors or while in the elevator using this feature - half the time your car is going to end up around the block. You have to manually input the address and be mindful you are standing on that side of the building for your ride because that is the door we are going to roll up to.

If a driver asks you to exit the vehicle before the ride starts.......,16,81.33051210917809,uber,"it is advisable to do just that. Twice this week, 2 separate incidents , I asked , politely, for the pax to exit the vehicle since this ride was not going to happen. In both incidents the pax started off verbally abusing me, complaining about service,professionalism  and their miserable day. I never hit ""start ride"" until I am convinced there are no complications with pax /driver relationship. Both of these requests were met with, ""I am not leaving this vehicle so just drive"". In both of these incidents I explained that I could see a negative rating and a complaint to support was inevitable coming from them. I repeated my request and elaborated as to why and was still refused. That is when I took my phone out of its cradle, opened all of the windows. turned the engine off exited the driver seat, walked around to the pax door which I proceeded to open and asked them to exit again. Both complied and ranted on about what they would report , etc. I never threatened them with any type of physical harm, but said next option was a 911 call. 

Hint to pax; most drivers do not respond favorably to abuse. We do not have to transport you but agree to unless circumstances convince us not to. In 16 months of driving, I have resorted to this rarely and only as a last resort. I will not take abuse, a bad rating and attitude for $2.50.","Pretty good. Honestly I'd probably just go ahead and call 911 immediately the moment they refused, might as well get the calvary rolling since if they truly refuse it could be awhile to get them out. Definitely smart to remove yourself from the vehicle though, no sense in being trapped in a cage with an animal.  I hope you never make another tip in your miserable pathetic life. You are obviously an asshole and I hope UBER catches on to your bullshit. Just because you didn't like how someone *looked* then maybe you should stop being a racist piece of shit. Your post history says it all. Out of curiosity why did you not want to take the ride after you accepted it and driven to the PAX location? What did you feel about the PAX in that short window after arriving?"
How can I get a bad rating removed? This asshole pax 1 starred me for not allowing 6 people in an Uber X. POS,12,81.46797738695587,uber,,"Pretty much everyone learns this the hard way. Lyft will reverse the rating but not uber. Hey at least you got paid. Getting 1 star is no big deal. Next time never take a pax that requires some sort of compromise. When I started driving only on weekdays during the day I noticed every single passenger complaint on these subs completely vanished.  No drunk riders, no one trying to cram 6 people in my car, most people are on time because they have someplace to be.  Occasional minors, but that's easy to deal with.  My rating went from 4.87 to 4.92 also. If you cancled the ride there is no way for him to rate you.  It must have been someone else. In the future, cancel the ride and kick everyone out. They can't leave feedback on a canceled ride. I haven’t had this happen in a while. However, when it does (college football season will be upon my market soon), I’ll simply say, “I’ll go ahead and just cancel so you all can see if you can get a different driver.” I’ll pull off a little way and wait for the timer to expire, the cancel with the “No show” option.

I said ""good!, and now that I have you in my car we need to talk about Jesus..."", and I waited for their mouths to gape open before finishing ""just kidding!"" This goes both ways. In general I stay clear of religion and politics but some riders just love bringing it up. Other day I had a thirty minute ride with a guy non stop talking about I need to spend more time with God. 

I go to drop him off and he says, hold on I have something for you. I'm thinking a cash tip, but then he pulls out a Bible. Gives it to me and says, just thirty minutes a day got to give god some time too. Report them. They’re drivers not preachers. [deleted] As you should. I've never one-started any driver but this would get me to do it There are two things you can’t discuss in my car... politics and religion.

I’ll respect anyone’s beliefs but when they try to push it on me the gloves come off. That kind of solicitation boils my blood. I am flabberghasted that someone would do this. Never discuss religion and politics sheesh.

&#x200B;

The worst mistake I made was I was speaking to a pax and she was going to a surprise bday bash for a friend who was in a band. Somehow the conversation got to some one they know who is in the band who does bugger all (like playing tambourine or something) and I said it reminded me of how useless Yoko Ono was (was thinking of that video where she schreeches along to Chuck Berry and John Lennon). 

Well turns out this pax is a massive Yoko Ono fan and started talking about how much she loves her art and all this stuff. I tried my best to agree and salvage the situation but not sure if it worked. I think she rated me 5 but it is possible she was one of my few 4s :P Ahh the good ol christian Just tell them you worship the devil. Riders do this as well. Curious , what religion do this??? I agree. I'll talk about what ever they want to but politics and religion are off limits and will never turn out ok. I can handle religion/politics coming up in conversation as long as the subject is changed very shortly after (you know the “im glad you’re up ubering so early on a sunday to get me to work” “yeah, i do this before i head to church.  It can be a good little boost to my income so i can pay into the tith.  Anyways, you work at _____?  How is that?”). People’s lives can be just that, their lives.   But if they start going really into it or proselytising at me,  they are getting 1 starred and no tip. I’ve had a couple drivers start the conversation with something along the lines of “Can I tell you something” or “let me/I’m gonna let you in on something” and literally start going on about reincarnation, nature, God, the grand plan, etc and how they’re all connected. A recent one even brought in the Matrix (like, the movie) and how the concept of there being an AI being real and what we perceive as reality isn’t actually real. It’s weird but I usually just try to be polite and not say anything either way. That's what it's for. Mike, I have a question for you, have you found Jesus yet? This happened to me while in Huntsville AL, I'm an Atheist and I was going to drink beers with a Tinder hookup so.... I have a strict no politics or religion policy in my car- even if we seem to agree on either item. It also help to know when someone wants to talk at all. Praying for you.  I can only imagine being this sour, but I know it cant be fun. What does California have to do with this?"
Am I crazy or are some of the Uber drivers not fond of foreigners?,15,81.6437065536446,uber,"So I am an American studying abroad in South Africa, and I’ve had to rely on Uber to get around. I’m still getting familiar with the area and the streets as I haven’t been in the country for long. Anyway I noticed that since the last few trips my rating has gone down from a perfect 5 stars to 4.4. I’ve been confused as to why, because I’ve never been rude or made a mess in the car, also I always tip the driver though it’s through the app and not direct cash. Recently, my friends who are also from overseas mentioned Uber and how their rating went down since they arrived. We were wondering if it’s because we are foreigners and the drivers favor those who grew up in South Africa. There’s both males and females in the group so I don’t think it has much to do with gender, but does anyone feel the same as we do about some of the drivers rating down Americans or are we just imagining?","If you're white, that's why. Many South Africans are very racist against white people. This is doubly true of the woke generation. Probably easier to figure out with the locals, they will know what’s going on cause it could be something as simple as a bus zone pick up or intersection ( happens in sf) 

Also don’t say “I will tip on the app” I agree with the earlier comment better to tip with cash so they know before they rate you. It's because you didn't tip with cash. There's an increasing number of petty and childish drivers that automatically 1-star riders that don't tip with cash. It's pretty stupid. Uber fares are absurdly cheap in South Africa, and Uber drivers know that foreigners are getting a really good deal. They are rating you less than five stars for not tipping in cash. Americans are ignorant fucking trash animals when they go to other countries 
What you think is “nice” and “good” here isnt actually that around the world"
Uber did not allow me to tip.,19,81.83992183142239,uber,Image,"You mean it didn't allow you to tip beyond the tip limit. In this case, it's $13.36. A far better system would be an option to override the limit for those that actually want to tip more than the limit. The best you can do is tip $13.36 and next time, carry cash on you in small notes. This is stupid? This is probably for security reasons. A driver could potentially mug the pax and tip themselves $9999. From the beginning, it seems that the Uber’s culture doesn’t allow drivers to make money :) Thank you. Just as the annotation said

WARNING TO WOMEN-I was assaulted then accused of theft by an Uber driver,21,82.30305840554337,uber,"I was at a club dancing and enjoying cocktails. A man there was flirting and dancing with me.  At the end of the night I was about to start looking for a Lyft or an Uber when this man offered to give me a ride home. I know it wasn’t wise to accept a ride from a stranger but I can’t change the bad decision I made. When he pulled into my driveway and stopped he proceeded to forcefully kiss and grope me. I pushed him away, said some choice words, got out of the car and went into my house. 15 minutes later I had 2 cops at my door. They said they received a complaint from an Uber driver that I refused to pay him. I was dumbfounded. This man was still sitting in my driveway! I tried explaining what really happened. They didn’t believe me. They told me I needed to pay him $35 or i would be charged with theft.  I even showed them my phone and the Uber app. I didn’t order an Uber! I was getting pissed by now. They took his word with no evidence and completely dismissed mine. I am now on my way to the police station to get a copy of the police report so that I have his full name to file a complaint with Uber. I’m FURIOUS.","/r/thishappened This is total bullshit what do you mean by them didn’t pay the fare? you don’t pay the fare in cash, in fact that’s illegal. The fare should be charged automatically through your card, so just use this as a fact. In your case. and show them your uber history that there’s no ride requests that you received. then I’d sue his ass then for sexual harassment for touching you and false accusation. and if you take him to court, ask him for a proof that he gave you an uber ride through the app. he should have all that . 

Sorry this happened to you.

(If it’s true) If this did happen, why are you posting this here? Sounds fake. Even if this is real it’s 100% the polices fault not Uber’s. Useless post So fake. If any parts are real, it's a kind of dumber and dumber.

He could have just driven away instead of taking so many risks. 1st, he gave out his ID. I doubt if anybody will do that unless he had a big grudge against you. What did you two do at the club?

2nd, he assaulted you. Nowadays there are cameras everywhere. And there are easily witnesses when you were in the driveway, like your neighbors through windows or walking dogs, or somebody in your own houses.

He really didn't have proof of anything. He may get $35 from you or get you charged. That's it. It won't hold up in court. 

There's so much proof against him. Certainly Uber has the trip data if you ever ordered it. So it will prove that he filed a false report. If you have a verbal agreement, basically it's illegal - street hailing. But it's a grey area if he didn't solicit you on the street. He has no proof of the verbal agreement. And it's not theft of service because it's not a legal service.

On his phone, the simple proof is the waybill. Your pickup point and destination and your details will be on his phone until he accepts another Uber ride. He didn't.

And will an Uber driver waste 15 min to get $35 and risk so much?

I really doubt if the cops are so stupid. 1st they arrive in 15 min. He could have to wait for an hour. So I really doubt. The cops ask you to pay $35? If the guy is pissed, he could have refused to drop charges and doesn't ask for $35. 

And how do you get home after going to the police station? Another Uber ride for what, $20? I would have paid the $35 and told the police on record that you don't admit guilt, just to avoid going to the police station without a lawyer. You will be back.

The police cannot completely dismiss your assault with or without evidence. You can file a police report and they have to investigate, if only for a few virtual minutes.

But you can save your effort to complain to Uber. They don't need to do shit if you don't have proof. If you file an assault charge against him, maybe Uber may keep you on file and watch him. Of course, Uber may deactivate him for simplicity but I doubt that if you didn't order a ride.

So I call it a fake unless you can provide more details. Or, if you two pissed each other off so much, the dumbest things can happen. troll cunt bullshit

This is probably another one of holierthanthee's many alt accounts bizarre story. Obviously I would have laughed at the cops & said this random stranger stalked me from the bar and is trespassing on my property. It's not like the cops can compel you to pay somebody cash for services, thats a civil matter, tell them he can sue you in court if thats what he wants. The driver waited in my driveway for the cops to come to my home. I wasn’t at the police station.  He did not identify himself as an Uber driver. He’d been inside the bar! My guess is after he assaulted me he was worried that I was calling the police based on how I reacted to his mauling me. I wasn’t. I chalked it up to stupidity on my part for accepting a ride with a stranger.  I really think he reacted this way thinking he’d get ahead of any potential accusation. I really don’t know. Y’all think this is so unbelievable well imagine my reaction when the police are at my door accusing me of theft of services. I was at first incredulous then furious. And I imagine, in their eyes, hysterical.  The 2 cops at my door treated the situation like he was a taxi cab driver. They did not verify that I actually ordered the Uber. I was argumentative and furious with them which did not help the situation. They wouldn’t even look at
my phone which I was begging them to look at to see that there was no current ride history with this man. I paid the $35 because I was not interested in being charged with theft. I HAVE filed this with Uber. His driver access is suspended while they investigate. I’m not angry at Uber. I’m not blaming them at all. I use ride sharing all the time. But they need to know the integrity and criminal behavior of their drivers. My next step is figuring out what to do about the total ineptness of the two cops at my door. If this is how they handle ride sharing theft accusations in my small town, anyone could accuse anyone of it. I’m curious if ANYONE has experienced anything similar. Even remotely similar. As a driver in my city, the cops would have charged me for taking a fare outside of the app. It’s illegal and most cops know to look for it. Story sounds like bs. but if it’s true, you’re lucky that’s all that happened. That’s also a misleading title. It really should say “Warning to Women - don’t get in a strangers car”"

It’s all about the money that they can take from us ! Are you going to keep doing it if they don’t give you a bag? Yes? Then why would they give you anything? Because they are totally hands off . That’s how they make $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ To be honest, those cheap bags dont do anything.....that doordash bag is useless."
Locked out of account?,2,82.40937784999885,uber,My husband locked out of his uber account. When he tries to log in it tells him to reset his password and when he follows the prompt to do that literally nothing happens. It is like the account is somehow locked? He needs to log in to change his password but he can't log in. He has uninstalled and installed multiple times but nothing has helped. We have tried to contact customer service but 1) there is no customer support phone number and 2) they keep telling me that the person who owns the account needs to contact them via the Help section of the app. I keep saying that we can't get into the account to even contact Help and they keep sending the same message that the owner of the account needs to write in to Help. This is infuriating. Any advice?,"Is he trying to reset his password from his phone app? If so, try doing it on a computer.

*Stupid for taking an Uber to go to 7/11.  Walk your stupid ass. Yea...no. That’s not even remotely possible. Your “buddy” is straight up lying to you.

Drivers have NO access to a riders info FFS. I love stupid fucking stories like this...really fun to see how dumb people are. Can you explain to us how that happened? Did your friend drop $14 cash in the car and then not get it back?  That's the only way that's possible, all billing is handled by Uber nothing is done by the driver. Can you guys believe that our livelihood depends on the ratings of people like this? I had this rare opportunity as well. Pax left his phone in my car unlocked. I looked at it and it's on rate driver, so of course I 5 starred myself. Then the tip driver comes up. I left it on that screen and returned the phone to him. He gave me $30 in cash and $50 thru the app. Honesty is the best policy. This really made me laugh If that's the case, it's likely to be a glitch on Uber's end. There is no way for a driver to tip himself any amount for a trip. You're a dumbfuck. How in your tiny mind does a business allow a driver to tip themselves using your card info?

Don't blame the app. Common sense would tell you to look at your map and see where you're going and ignore stupid recalculations. And for sure don't just keep driving in a circle because ""the map said to go this way"". Figure it out! I need to get to work. Or I'm hungry and want my food hot.

Just having a license and a car isn't enough. Fix it.","You are a complete moron.

Complete and utter useless idiot.

You need a dose of humility and an attitude adjustment. 

The truth is that the app is wrong. Uber is completely incompetent and that extends to their app development. The app often gives us a completely different location than what you think you're putting the pin, but passengers (based on your post, you are a perfect example) are often oblivious of anything going on around them and feel that they can't be bothered to take steps to correct a problem they are causing.

If your pickup point doesn't work, try another. Walk to the front office (likely where the app is sending the drivers, regardless of where you are putting the pin). Take proactive steps to find a solution for your problem rather than blame drivers and demand they magically read your mind. 

If you keep having the same experience with different people, maybe the problem is you. Wow. I haven't seen an entitled asshole such as yourself in a while on Reddit and this is Reddit, so that's saying something. 

If you're so convinced if your intellectual superiority, why haven't YOU come up with a simple solution such as copy-pasting a text with instructions on how to get to you?

I have used in Uber in countries where the addressing system isn't great and have simply called the driver and told them to ignore the GPS and follow my instructions. 

Life is easier when you aren't an entitled ass. Try it some time. Oh my God, I cannot stand idiotic passengers like you.

You're the Karen with a 4.6 rating that I accept because it's slow and I curiously want to see how truly bad you can be. And 3 microseconds after I click the accept button, you're texting me ""Where are you???? Hello???? I'm in a rush!!"" and I'm sitting in my car at the red light going oh my God what did I get myself into, and meanwhile you're going ""You're not moving, hello!!!!""

When you click your location, are you letting the app find you or are you dropping the pin? Because if I'm guessing right, you're probably clicking the first button you see so it auto-finds you, and, since your dumbass is probably in some concrete apartment, it sends your location to the other side of the complex and that is what the driver sees.

Also, did you know (you probably don't, because you don't seem to know much of anything) that when an Uber driver is driving in a *straight line*, on the passenger app, due to GPS signals and interference, it might show the driver spinning in circles, especially if they're driving slow due to like, I don't know, traffic or speed limits in a neighborhood? 

There are some dumbass drivers on the road, no one is doubting you there. If you were talking about 1 or 2 instances, sure, your complaints might be warranted. But if *every driver* you get is a dumbass (or moron as you call as), then maybe the only dumbass in this situation is, get ready for this, *you*.

You ever hear the phrase, ""If you meet 1 asshole, then that person is an asshole. If everyone you meet is an asshole, you're the asshole.""

Buy your own car if we suck so bad. Heat up your own food in your own microwave if you want super hot food. I would say cook something but if you don't have a car I doubt your ability to make something on the stovetop without burning your shitty 1/1 apartment down. Otherwise, do everyone in this world a favor, shut the FUCK up, realize your shit stinks (and it stinks *real* bad), check your pin location twice, try to be a half-decent person for once in your life, and stop projecting your failings in life onto Uber drivers that are just trying to get to the pin location that you mistakenly put on the other side of your apartment complex. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2908  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/74431) Walk your lazy ass out to the road and get your shit or wait for the ride. Are all of these drivers that bad or is it this one guy that’s an idiot? I’ll guess the latter. It’s no coincidence that this is happening with many different drivers. Walk your fat ass to the front of the complex. Geez. Lyft is substantially better at showing the actual pax location in addition to the pin. I’d suggest switching. You’re frustration is understandable.  You need to understand this is also frustrating for the drivers that are driving in circles trying to locate you. There’s clearly an issue with navigation guiding driver’s to your location. Do something to rectify it. Give the driver a landmark or create one. You’ve never had GPS screw you around before? The majority of pickups are uneventful so the common denominator to your issue seems to be your location.  Walk a mile in someone else’s shoes before judging. 

  Sincerely,
           Just a regular guy trying to make a few extra $$$."

Now you're just wasting your own time walking instead of getting dropped off in front. I am sure some fake news site posted this should be done for safety and now thousands of lemmings will follow. Wow, so ... I had plenty. They just don't want to be seen in an Uber by their neighbor or friends or co-workers. Here it means that the rider cannot afford a car, banned because of DUI, or has no friends to rely on when their car is in the shop. Yup. They are paranoid and do not understand that you actually have their address. Living in fear is no way. This happens to me once in a while, but not 2 blocks. Usually just around the corner from the drop off. I always think it’s someone trying to creep up on their significant other or they are the side piece and don’t want the neighbors to see a car pull up and someone get out. These people have probably heard about bad drivers in the news so I don't blame them. As a driver, I am surprised how many passengers don't care about the driver knowing where they live. Teachers and cops get background checks too, doesn't stop some of them from assaulting people. It just means they hadn't been caught yet.

Quite a few 'background checked' drivers have assaulted passengers. I don't blame passengers for not wanting to give out their address. 

And why do you care, 2 blocks early isn't worth that much in terms of pay.

If this is happening to you so frequently, maybe you are making your passengers uncomfortable to the point where they want to get out early/not let you know where they live. Maybe they don't want to wake someone."

Here's why Uber buying Postmates could be a win-win for everyone involved (UBER),3,85.55009544278737,uber,Image,"Uber has zero to gain by buying postmates.  The entry into that industry for competition is low, so buying a competitor wont do anything.    

It would be cheaper to just make another app under a different name and market it differently.  That would give them way more benefit than buying postmates. Business insider calling something a win-win is guaranteed to make it a complete disaster. Growing monopolies are awesome."
Awesome discounts since last week?,3,85.57699359094931,uber,"Hello,

Three teens in their 16-17's request an Uber...,15,85.5880815539233,uber,"Three teens in their 16's request an Uber. When I get there I see them hiding beer all over their waist and laughing like if it was something really funny. They look drunk as well. I cancel the ride right away and put unaccompanied underage as the excuse of cancelling. 

I've had 1% cancellation rate for over 2 months. Uber comes and slams me and drops my cancellation rate to 2%.  


This infuriates me.  What was I supposed to do? Give them a ride? Come on Uber! You can do much better than this!","Is there a reason you want your cancellation rate at 1%? You could have told them to cancel the ride or you were going to contact the cops about their underage drinking. That sucks. At least now you know to wait for the timer to run out next time. Much more profitable to wait for them to cancel. They will most likely attempt to immediately order another driver and can't until they or you cancel. Underage ping for me this A M. I did not hit start ride and pax f bombed me and waited for me to cancel so she could order another driver. I told her I would cancel after timer counted down. She immediately cancelled and I was pinged again to her while still in her driveway. Got my $3.90 and told her I could keep collecting as long as she kept ordering .  This one of the reasons I am not anxious to hit ""start ride"". I had an issue with an underage pax today. I cancelled immediately using the unaccompanied minor option and still received the cancellation fee. My cancellation rate did not take a hit. It actually says “if you had a safety concern, (ie: no car seat or underage pax) or your rider didn’t show your cancellation rate won’t change.” I would contact support

This was in a pool ride in which both of the riders were leaving the same high school and were both underage. I cancelled them back to back and it ended the pool. I got 7.50 out of the deal. Maybe it’s different in an Uberx ride. Not only I wasted gas, but it's been super slow. I only made $19 in 4 hours yesterday."
Someone’s a low key A-hole because everyone of my rides have gone smooth.

Kicked out of car for having *sealed* bottle of wine in my groceries by a Muslim driver.,99,86.0756162761814,uber,"First off, definitely not upset at all by his race or religion.  Had many drivers that were super religious and never said a word about it, even if they preached and listened to religious radio. Just sat quietly in the back and responded with normal, civil conversation. Had plenty of different races and dgaf. Just thankful for a safe ride. 

Today I had my first bad experience with uber, which I take to and from work every day. 

I ordered an Uber today after work (I work at a grocery store and had done some shopping afterwards). He pulled up, popped his trunk for my groceries and then I jumped in the back. 
The very first thing he asked was if I had any alcohol.  I said yes I did and he told me he couldn't drive me and asked me to leave his car.  Was a little thrown off but got out immediately and he canceled my ride. I understand that he was muslim and alcohol is something they do not tolerate. Not upset or wanted him in any trouble. 
Just want to make sure for the future that this is ok/allowed or if I should've done something different? 
I personally didn't mind except having to wait an extra 10 minutes to get home. But others are telling me that it was not ok and against your rules.","so youre not willing to report or give a bad rating...what is it youre looking for here? If it was a taxi then yes I would report the driver.

Considering this is a ride share then I say it's his car and his rules when it comes to his religious beliefs.

You can still report him but Uber is only going to send him a canned email about respecting community guidelines. The driver has no obligation to take you anywhere. For whatever reason he can not take a ride that was accepted. He did nothing wrong. I also praise you for being cool about it. I feel most pax wouldn't have your perspective regarding this experience. The world is not his religion! Report his Ass! I as a Muslim driver an surprised by his behaviour, if he thinks he can get by in a predominantly non-Muslim country by kicking out pax that have sealed alcoholic beverages, then God help him.  He will soon have a hard time   Uber will indeed deactivate his ass.  

Alcohol was banned only after the companions of the prophets time were found to be reading Quran backwards while they were in prayer drunk, Muslim countries have and sell alcohol at bars. Casablanca, Cairo, Alexandria, Middle East, you name it.  At least it isn't narcotics.  Only in Saudi Arabia would a person be beheaded execution style for drug possession, but Alcohol in Saudi Arabia is thrown away by the religious police when they see people drink it, the Saudi Government now stopped religious police.  Alcohol being held by another person does absolute no sin to Uber Driver or any Muslim let alone a closed one.

I fear this driver may be the Sharia law loving type that can become extremist.  But only God knows. You were incredibly understanding and are to be commended. Kudos.

&#x200B;

Personally, I dont't think anyone's religion should ever become someone else's problem, but if that's the way he rolls, no harm, no foul. He just doesn't want to be around alcohol. No biggie.

&#x200B;

He doesn't have to accept any particular passenger for any reason, just as riders do not have to work with drivers they are not comfortable with.

&#x200B;

Editing this reply because I realized that if he didn't tell you his rules beforehand, and collected a cancellation fee, that's not right. You did not waste his time, he wasted yours. Although it’s annoying and an inconvenience to you, as long as he canceled the ride and didn’t ask you to (and therefore pay the cancel fee) then I’d say he acted properly. They didn't discriminate against you. Not being muslim isnt an identity.

Straight from Uber:

**You can request a rider to exit your vehicle in case they do not follow your personal rules inside your vehicle however please consider going the extra mile for every ride.**

If your personal rule is no alcohol, it's no alcohol. 

If you dropped the alcohol, there'd be no issue. If you were a person who they refused to accept based on your identity- gender, sexuality, religion, disability-- something you cannot take off? **That** is discrimination.

Edit: Lmao, can you imagine? ""What's your religion?"" ""NOT MUSLIM"" what? How do you actively practise not being muslim? Report. 

It’s 2019 - not the Middle Ages. No reason to tolerate this level of ignorance and intolerance. I don’t care the specific religion. We live in an age of rationality and facts. This level of ignorant clap trap shouldn’t be tolerated in public. His car his rules he is obviously a very devout Muslim and didn't want anything like alcohol in his car.

 Granted if I had a strict policy I would not be picking up from grocery stores.  Oe I would send a text through the app saying I appreciate it you dont have any alcohol if you do please cancel ride find somebody else I don't do a thing because my religion says. - ok

You can't do a thing because my religion says. - not ok Not anything you can do except report.

I'm trans and the worst I've had so far is people aggressively playing Christian radio when I get in the car.

If they decided they didn't want me in their car, that's fine, I'll report and order another one.

People gonna people. Im an uber driver.. i would not do that.. give him bad review.. people have given  me a bad review for less... my opinion is that it is racists not to give him a bad review.. Welcome to New America. It's his property, he can choose what and who gets into it. It's his car and his rules. Carrying alcohol is not a protected class like race or disability. You can complain, but there's legally nothing the driver is obligated to do in this matter. The driver could ban you if you wore a Yankees cap, same result. Yup, that driver needs to find something else to do for work. Suppose you were a female and he asked you to cover your head with a scarf? As an service provider and contractor , driver can cancel whenever they wanted, and you will not be match anymore, but he have to give the reason to uber , 

But this should be reported since he/she use religion as based, and Uber would not tolerated this Be happy.  At least he didn't blow himself up. I like the “I don’t hate Muslims disclaimer” lol Nothing in this says the driver refused because he is muslim he just said I can't take you. The OP understood he was muslim. Maybe he is a dick, who knows. Report him or say fuck all to do with you what's in my bag, hit the gas. His car, his rules.. don't like it then get another uber. The Supreme Court has been very friendly to religious nut jobs recently.  Unfortunately he’s completely within his rights.  

One star him.  Then report him saying that **in your opinion he seemed to be intoxicated**.  He’ll automatically be suspended from the app a couple of days.  If his rating goes low enough he’ll eventually be kicked off. He's permitted to refuse service on any lawful grounds. I don't think Uber's community guidelines have anything specific to say either except the other way: drivers are permitted to refuse service on any lawful grounds, but are encouraged not to.

The only thing you can do is leave a bad rating. You could report, but that report goes into a database to be forgotten until his account comes under review for some different reason. He's within his rights to deny you a ride for pretty much whatever reason, but you're also within your rights to complain. With a cancelled ride you wouldn't be able to rate him poorly, but in this case I might consider mentioning it to Uber support. Not that that is likely to do anything. The main reason I'd complain isn't his reason for denying you a ride, it's that he waited until your groceries were in his trunk and you were in the car. He should have gotten out to help you or discuss it with you while you were loading your groceries in. I've had plenty of cancellations like this, where something about the passenger or destination meant I had to cancel, and I always did so before anyone got in my car.  


If he keeps this up his cancellation rate will probably lead to him being deactivated before long, so you also don't really need to do anything at this point.  


But yeah, you're very understanding, and the guy was within his rights, but it sounds like he was also a jerk about it."

https://i.imgur.com/zjUQ7G0.jpg

I started in August ‘16 and it was a gold mine the first week. $1300 for 33 hours work. It was Baylor welcome week so there were lots of students moving in. I had done the same thing myself in 2005. It felt like the furthest thing from “work”, it was just me getting to hang out with 18 year olds, many of them with a background 67% similar to mine.

We talked religion, we talked politics, we talked Walmart routes, we talked about the Rangers/Spurs/Mavericks/Longhorns/Aggies/Miners/Lobos/Dragons/Stars/Texans. We didn’t talk about the Horned Frogs though. We kicked them out of the Big 12 so they were pretty irrelevant back then 😉 

I had been out of work a few months for mental health reasons. My previous jobs were for nonprofits and churches so my income had ranged from .25/hr to $10/hr. $33/hr made me feel like a King.

Since then it’s been mostly a good experience. 

I’ve certainly paid a pretty penny for some therapy sessions after some of the things I’ve seen. I like the late and early hours. There’s no traffic and you get to see the sunrise. Austin, Dallas, Henderson, Galveston, Marfa, Waco; it’s all incredible. But some really dark things can happen at night.

Providence Hospital in Waco also uses Uber/Lyft to taxi patients home and sometimes those rides can take it out of ya. I’ve gone to Mexia, Hubbard, Fairfield, Valley Mills just to name a few. Some folks have been in that hospital for months. It’s certainly life giving, but it is hospice care sometimes.

I’ve also given rides to a sex workers going to a clients (both from Waco-DFW), college students going to jail,  and drug addicts going to the hospital to use hard drugs in the parking lot in case anything happens. So, yea, maybe watch some EMT videos and go to a mental health first aid training if you’re really going to take this gig seriously. Unbound in Waco also has really good resources and people to talk to if you think there’s some shady things going on.

Enough of the 😳🤔😐. How bout some 😃😿🤮


Let me just tell ya about how fun it is to work all over the state whenever you want.

I’ve driven a 40 mile radius of 35 from SA to the OK border, and in descending order Waco/Dallas/Austin/Fort Worth/Rockwall-Royse City, Plano, McKinney, Park Cities/Houston-Galveston/SA. 
Driving in a new metro area can be tough at first, especially if you haven’t spent at least 3 weeks in Houston over the course of your life. My first week driving in the Houston area was League City. I started with UberEats deliveries so I didn’t have to talk and navigate at the same time. Eventually, once 11 pm rolled around I’d start accepting riders, and I got to scratch my social itch. Late night riders are always more patient too (at least sober), so navigating and talking is much easier (I’ve had to have missed 200 turns bc I was too caught up in conversations).

As far as the “drunks” that everybody is afraid to let in their car, I’ve never had anyone puke *in my car*. 3-4 times I’ve had to pull over and let them do the deed, but as long as you’re driving safe and paying attention, you should be good (listen for the dry heaves 🥴). The only time I’ve had to get a cleaning fee was when a service dog left mud on the seat (which Uber paid $20 for, not the rider). And that ride actually happened 2 weeks ago in Longmont, Co so I’ve never had to report a rider/dog/cat in Texas.

I did have one cat puke, but it was in the carrier. It was gross, but the woman I was driving was blind and it was her roommate. It’s definitely made the list of stories I tell. That woman also became a regular customer, I took her to Austin 2-3 times from Waco.
She’s one of my favorite riders. 

Speaking of the visually disabled, they are my favorite riders. If you’ve never seen someone blind work their iPhone and Apple watch better than you can, youtube it. Or go volunteer at the VA. The VA Hospital in Waco has an excellent blind rehabilitation unit so I’ve gotten to take both blind patients and doctors to and from.

I have let 30-40 people smoke in my car. https://reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5lygjk/uber_driver_with_a_bogus_drug_paraphernalia_charge/ Sometimes people have really rough days, they need any break they can get. Essential oil water spray and a quick upholstery scrub get any lingering stench away. And from 1-4 am, riders don’t care if the car smells a little smokey, especially in Waco.

$$$. I can give some spreadsheet analytics to people if they want them in the comments, but my annual income from Uber/Lyft has been about 20k the last 2 years. That may not sound like a living wage, but for me, a single male in Waco that pays $400 rent and has parents that pay for said therapy/psychiatry, it’s as the old gal Goldilocks said; just enough. I also only worked 30 weeks last year. 

I just hit Uber Pro Gold. I’ve done over 3000 rides for them with a 4.87 rating so now I can get some more 
edjamacation. One perk of this point based system is college tuition. After FAFSA/grants/scholarships, Uber and Arizona State University foot the bill. They also offer 8 week English and Business classes if you don’t have a GED.

My tentative plan is to get a Spanish degree. I took Russian and Swahili in college and feel silly for never taking the time to learn it. Lo siento amigos.

And I just moved to Denver/Boulder. So if you ever want to go to another state but still get to hangout with Texans 19% of the time this can be a gig to do it.


I’ve said nothing about Favor. My bad H-E-B. I’ll write you a love leter. 
I’ve been to grocery stores in 17 countries. From what I can tell, the Butts created the best grocery chain in the world. Howard was a Texan saint. His kids have helped make Baylor and Texas great. Give that family a google.

H-E-B employees are my second favorite riders. It’s a really hard job, but those folks are always so kind, and if you get bored in the middle of your work shift you can go say hello (if they become a regular rider and you’re not being creepy). They also randomly get $1000 bonuses sometimes. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.

If you don’t want to be a Taxi driver but still want to see your city or county, work for Favor. They have the best support staff of all the gig economy jobs. It can take a minute to get a hold of support sometimes, they’re working out the kinks. And they actually have accessible support offices where you get to talk to a human in person all over the state (Uber y Lyft, please spend more money on Waco driver support).

H-E-B owns Favor, in case you weren’t aware.

Alright enough out of me. Yall say something.

Man I removed when I first started a few years ago. Used to get like $200 for 20 ride quests lol. I always wonder if you all know if uber doesn't make any money, everyone is out of work There's a tone of full time teachers on vacations. I've spoken to a ton of them, they're unerring full time. When vacations are over, the number of drivers will decline and you will most likely see better promotions. Well, they are definitely being stingy with their money. Restructuring the pay, de creasing the amount per mile, smaller surges and more drivers sure does hurt. Lol! Damn! Worst incentive EVER! What Is this? Is this only for certain areas? Depends on your market and “rank”. That’s not what I got Fuck Uber Do you put in a lot of rides? I imagine these quests are tailored to attainable ride volume. If you are full time then 30 rides is easy and you're going to complete this quest anyway so it's a free $10 bonus every time. They just want to make sure you arent giving too many lyft rides. Meanwhile I haven’t seen a quest in months. Better than nothing, I say. I haven't seen a Quest/Promo in over 2.5 years. They haven't had any quests or bonuses in my market in the 3+ years I've been driving, but the rates are good and haven't been cut at all.  Seems busier now than it used to also. I haven't had any bonuses for months, I didn't know they still did that.  I think the number of drivers definitely accounts for this. Honestly as a rider I hate the cute.

I think it would be a useful addition for drivers to show that:

A) users with a 5 star rating either have a new account or are great passengers

B) users with a low ranking are either a terrible passenger, are just starting out or had a bad experience. 

I think allowing this statistic would change how drivers view ratings quite a bit.","Rarely a driver would down rate a rider, simply because it happens instantly, and the rider knows, so the chance of them rating you higher or tipping you, are out the door. The rider had 7 days to rate/review/tip you; drivers are instant; unlike Lyft... The rating system is just silly, no one uses stars 2 through 4. I suspect that if it were changed to a thumbs up or down, everyone would complain, yet that is exactly how everyone uses it. The whole rating system sucks anyway, it's only there to keep costs down, subjugate drivers and make passengers think they are empowered. It replaces an effective customer service team I always thought this was a good idea.  They show a lot about the drivers' rides and sometimes their compliments.  You have good  points.  Uber seems to constantly change what they are showing & different cities are also different from each other it seems.

Provide tools (the app) for customers and private contractors to interact with each other.  Cut out all attempts to make any profit, simply pay yourself and the employees who run the app. No marketing, throw the cost of insurance down to the drivers directly (maybe this would help create another insurance sector, thus building more business, like a lower fee commercial insurance business). 

Then being a non-profit, set up services for the elderly that use Medicare. Medicare provides the right to transportation.  Medicare would be paid out directly to Uber. Uber drivers who take the elderly would still get their tax write offs and basic pay.  Would be a good way for any company to funnel money, but for it to work would need to be non-profit. 

Just thoughts."
What are the most heard excuses riders give to not tip?,46,87.47140331332054,uber,"Let's poke the bear... Why not?
We need to learn that drivers should be treated like restaurant waiters, it's a service, but the pay is very low. The rider should tip so the drivers make a decent share home; when you discount the gas, tires, maintenance, cleaning, etc., the take home is very low. We are NOT taxi service, nor a business, that's why the price between Uber and taxi's is so different; taxi is a business, the company makes money and so do the drivers. Rideshare was design to Splurge cost of going from point A to point B, in the hope of getting someone on your route. 


-I will tip you in the app.

-I hope you get a ride back, I am sure you will (after taking you to a rural area or way out of town)

-You guys are so much cheaper than taxi's, faster, and cleaner cars.

-I hear there is a lot of money to be made, look how nice you're car is.

-This car is nicer than mine.

-Local minimum wage employees without cars; too lazy to walk or wait on a bus.

-Local bar drunks (the obnoxious type)

-Local pickup at fast food restaurants

-Local pickup at grocery stores

-Local pickup at Walmart/Target or convenience store.


Let's see what kind of heat this gets...","There is no reason to tip. Uber was created to get away from tipping.  All the costs are already in the fee you pay.  

I dont see why anyone would give an excuse for something that is not required. Doesnt matter how many excuses might exist, there is only 1 real excuse pax have for failure to tip and thats because they're cheap, plain and simple. They only tip in other industries due to the shame of paying last and having someone recognize their face next time. They know with uber there's a good chance they'll never see you again. Most of the points you listed don't even make sense as an ""excuse not to tip"". I don’t tip because the only transportation options I have is my brother and Uber. If an Uber driver wants to complain I get it, but I’m
Paying for the convenience of the ride and sometimes the conversation. If I can tip I will, but most of the time I use Uber as a last means of getting somewhere I need to be. I have nothing to say except as someone from a country with next to no tipping,  this conversation makes my head hurt! I'll give you 5 stars!



Well thanks let me take those 5 stars to Walmart and see if they accept it at register. As you said. Rideshare was meant from going from A to B and recoup some of the money spent. 

If you are using it to profit thats your fault.

Drive a taxi or get one of those minimum wage jobs you look down upon so much."
Uber Signs Deal with Healthcare-Focused Startup,7,88.04995655407508,uber,Image,"It’s kind of like Uber comfort, just crank up the ac so the body is frozen by the time you get to the morgue. Awesomeness. Now we get a bunch of broke and sick passengers. Opportunity for a shitload of ""no show"" cancellations for me. It had better be a separate service drivers can opt in/out of or the exodus to Lyft will only increase. So drivers with no medical training will now drive around people on the verge of death.    This will be bad when someone dies and they blame the healthcare company that said to use uber.

First 4 star ratings as driver,13,88.20031535037138,uber,"Had 9 trips in a 3 hour span. All Back to back.  
Had 4 tippers and 2 of the 9 left me 4 stars. I have only been driving about 3 weeks now. Brought my rating to 4.89.  
Not sure why the 4 stars. No comments left, all nice people. How badly is this 4.89 going to effect me now? 
Kinda bummed out.  There is no way to see what ratings the riders left correct?","Your rating won't earn you money. You could be 0.01 above the cutoff point for your market or a perfect 5.0 and you'll get the same requests. You're better off not even looking at your driver rating.

Even as a driver myself, I don't really care about my driver's rating whenever I request a ride. It can be a really small thing like a verbal interaction you missed or any small thing they didn't like. Or a passenger who just is in a bad mood today. Your rating doesn't really matter as long as it stays over the deactivation line. Do you suspect the four star-giving passengers were older people? Don’t worry , 

The more you drive the more you will get bad ratings, can’t satisfy everyone, as long you kept a clean car , and polite , that should be enough for them ..

I got bad ratings for :

Ac too cold ( summer time , it’s on 50%power)

Ac too hot ( summer time , and it’s full blast)

No good music selection( I use radio , and have Bluetooth if rider wants )

Too chatty/no good conversation

No leg room ( I drove Scion xB , and it got more leg and shoulder room than most sedan ) 

The driver have accent (born in southeast asian countries and I speak India, Malay , Singaporean , English and even Spanish ) 

No amenities ( used to have h20, gum, Kleenex, etc, now only puff tissue )

So really you could do nothing wrong and they still will give you bad ratings , so use your judgement in deciding they own ratings, usually I look at their rating, and if they are lower than4.8 , there must be a reason

So now I rate them base on their speed of pickup, location of the pick up , body odor, conversation ( some are like interrogator: where you from , how long u do this , do u have other job , blablabla) people who ask for recommendations are the one that usually tip more , also service industry peeps Like I said , don’t worry about the ratings , it only reflect for your 500 trips average

Currently I got :

400 plus 5 star
9 ...4star
5 ...3 star
2 .. 2 star
2 .. 1star

I still have a good 4.9 something ratings 

Most people when they order ride they don’t even care about rating , speed of you came and pick them is a plus , but never speeding just because you want a $5 fare...

Just keep driving , and after 6 months you should have known the tips and tricks and Learn from your mistake You won’t get deactivated that easily , Ive seen driver with 4.1 rating [deleted]"

There is no need to involve your insurance company or Uber's.  Doing so will only muddy the waters and you'll probably get dicked int he end. Hmm ok then maybe dont let uber know

"Wrong route, overcharged $15, Uber refuses to refund the difference.",9,88.48431998002309,uber,"In the past I’ve had 2-3 experiences with Uber where I’ve complained and they’ve made it right with a refund (if the driver was inappropriate) or fare adjustment. 

Last night my driver got on the wrong highway and took me 20 miles out of the way. I ended up being charged $31 instead of the $15 that was quoted because of this. There was no “poor route” or anything. Literally straight down a highway one way 10 miles til the first chance to turn around, and then up the same highway the other way for 10 miles to get on the original route. No he said/she said stuff. This is a cut and dried driver error. 

I emailed Uber support politely and informed them of the problem and asked for an adjustment to the quoted price. Nothing extra, just the original fare. They replied saying no, you’ve had fare adjustments in the past so we will not issue you any refunds. 

This makes no sense to me. Their own website states that the quoted fare will be the fare charged unless the rider makes changes to the trip/adds stops/etc. none of that happened. Just a mistake by the driver. 

All I get in emailing support is the same cut/pasted response which at times has nothing to do with what I’m asking. 

Is there a way to get in touch with an actual person who will actually read my emails and respond appropriately and intelligently? A phone number? Anything?!

Thanks for your help guys...","You appear to be of the opinion that Uber gives a fuck about you I live in a marketplace with particularly poor Uber service. So, maybe I've had a couple of refunds over the past year -- not customer service refunds, but Uber-needs-to-refund-me-because-the-driver-screwed-up. 

Well, earlier this week, I did a Pool ride. The driver was awful and spent 20 minutes at a fast food restaurant -- even asking me to walk there -- before picking me up, but I didn't complain about that. Nope! The problem was that her car literally died in the middle of the street -- miles from my destination -- a few minutes into the ride. So, I told her I was leaving, I cancelled, and I literally snapped a picture of her car with the hood up. 

I then sent Uber a message asking for a full refund, given the car was broken and died in the middle of the trip, and I wasn't even taken anywhere close to my destination.

Like you, Uber first denied the refund request outright -- why?! the car literally broke down and died! what the hell?! -- and then a couple of times I got a message stating that ""your account has received an unusually high number of refunds.""

Okay...

1) Uber chose to approve those refunds!

2) I haven't had that many refunds, and I use Uber \*a lot.\*

3) If I have had more refunds than they consider appropriate, it's because their service and drivers are often extremely unsafe or unprofessional -- or don't play by the rules. 

Uber is asking for a class-action lawsuit. They literally engage in breach of contract over and over and over again -- and get away with it. Grotesque company. Next time check the same route with both uber and lyft.

As a new driver, I am disappointed in how many people don't, especially those who say they will tip later. And some of these folks seem very well off (Newport Beach, Cali). I am guessing most people would not tip in a restaurant also if they can leave without shame like riders. ""A tip? Sure I'll give you a tip, kid. Don't ask for tips!"" People who tip will tip accordingly , people who doesn’t work in service industry rarely tip since they dunno the struggle ... rich and poor they all pretty much alike ..

Only service industry peeps / been working at restaurant /bar / any low and minimum wage in USA tip ...

But this is based on my experience, and I lived in my city for all my life ,

I do not go above and beyond anymore because sub par $ required sub par service , in my experience I usually tell them I do this ride because I need more $ to support my self , and it’s better than being panhandling / selling drugs ... they usually laugh and tip .. I once drove a guy an hour out of town. He told me he'd give me a really good tip to make up for the gas on the way back. Nothing. That's. That's not right! The driver should just do his job and drive and maybe look for another job. The company you are using to shuttle you around isn’t paying fair wages. Get used to it. [deleted] Uber was created to get away from tipping. The fees already include all the costs and wages.  

Never tip an uber driver unless you feel the need to tip every other worker you encounter like cashiers. So take a taxi, where they'll act like a credit card is a huge imposition. If you tip every ride anyway then why was it a big deal? Wouldn't you have tipped regardless?"

I gave some girls home who had hung out at a backyard campfire all evening. I wont lie, it was kinda annoying and they definitely made my entire car smell like burnt firewood. It certainly isnt disgusting in the way poor hygiene is. I had to drive around for about 15 minutes on the freeway with the windows down and then apologize to the next passenger about the smell.

The 3.75 cancellation fee is a joke if you’re trying to help a rider out.,52,89.79848664673389,uber,"Hey gang. Driver here to bitch about this wack policy:
Experience: 5000 rides in 2.5 years

So I get a call tonight around 10 pm, right after a Rockies game, and I’m 0.9 miles from Coors field.

I drive the 2 miles in about 10 minutes to the pickup location and the rider is no where to be seen. No problem, I text them to see if they’re maybe on the other side of the block.

They reply that they’re at the Seawall Ballroom, 0.2 miles away from their dropped pin. That’s close no problem. I spend the next 8 minutes in traffic and navigating one ways and when I arrive I let the rider know I’m out front.

Except they’re actually at Champa street 3 blocks over. Or they say in the app. 

Fine, they’re confused about where they are, it happens all the time. So I drive to the 3rd location. This time it takes me about 15 minutes minutes, and the rider isn’t calling or being all that helpful so I’m getting pretty annoyed with this trip.

I arrive at the final spot and let them know I’ve arrived and that I will wait 2 minutes. Then I have got to get back to actually taking advantage of this $7 surge that’s going on. 

They’re annoyed too at this point. It’s been at least a half hour since they requested me.

Here’s how the final exchange went:

Me: I’ve arrived at the address you gave me. I’ll be here 2 minutes then I have got to go.

Them: You’re not here I Dnot see you (their typo not mine)

M: I’m sorry sir, I’ve now spent about 25 minutes trying to find you and you’re not here

T: I’m here where are you (3 minutes after I sent the last message)

M: I’m sorry sir, I have to cancel the ride, please make sure you give your Uber driver the right location. The needle in a haystack game can be a real pain in the ass. Also, I’ll be paid 3.75 for this 30 minutes of driving and sitting and traffic.

T: you don’t deserve anything. Learn the area dick

M: I’ve lived here 5 years, have a nice night. (Full disclosure, white lie, been coming to CO since I was 8, but didn’t start “living” here until June. Just wanted him to know I wasn’t a rook).


While all of that was going on, I had to drive back .8 miles to the original pick up point they requested to actually cancel the ride, since I hadn’t been at that spot the full 5 minutes. 
Whatever. I do it, cancel the ride, then immediately drive to a safe place to call the sweet south Asians so they can hear me bitch about my last 40 minutes. They’re very helpful and understanding and do the best consoling and therapy that Uber will let them do until they move on to the next poor driver that lives 12,000 miles away from them.

That also took about 20 minutes because you know, you have to talk to at least 2 different Uber support staff to get anything done.

But, they couldn’t give me any “wait time” payment because the cancellation fee is flat. 3.75. That’s all you get.

All in all it was a huge waste of an hour where I could’ve potentially made 50-60 bucks off the ride but instead made 3.75. Do better uber.

TLDR
Drivers: Be good and kind and make every attempt to pick up your rider. But know your altruism can come with a cost: approx $57.33 in my case.
Riders:
Don’t treat your driver like shit. And if they’re a POC or an immigrant you better be fucking tipping them.


Edit: 
Read below for more, but this is Reddit right? I thought you guys(and girls) believed in karma.

If you’re seasoned you’ve given a handicapped person a ride and you know how important it is for them to get around. Isn’t a 1.5 hour ride where you make minimum wage and help a human better than 1.5 hours at $25 where you sit in traffic and drive drunks around?

Edit 2:

I talked to a nice dude from Belgium whose parents were from Portugal and Rwanda/Burundi at the Uber Hub in Denver. (I thought he was from France, I had to ask).

Uber gave me $10 and a lotta points. I also hit gold tonight. Bachelors degree here I come!","Should have cancelled from the original spot. Not your problem >And if they’re a POC or an immigrant you better be fucking tipping them. 


Fuck Whitey, huh? 5000 rides and you're basically behaving like you have done 5 rides. This was painful to read. It sounds like you made a bad situation worse.   When you arrived at the original pin, thats when the timer should have started.  Its not your fault they are in the wrong place and people won't realize you went above and beyond to find them.  Next time hit arrive when you get to the pin and when the timer runs out then you should not feel one bit bad about collecting your fee and leaving.  There was really no reason why this needed to be turned into a half hour.  Also your last sentence makes you sound crazy. You were too nice. If they arent in the right spot cancel and move on. 

That said, fuck your racist bullshit at the end You should only drive to the pin. Why would you drive around looking for a moron that has no idea how to use GPS or no idea where they are at? I learn it the best way is to go to the designation  pick up area , wait 3 mins , then call or text , and leave .

You probably will match with the rider only once 

Rider aren’t your friend 

Uber is business 

If they cannot use the proper location on uber , then this is the best way to make them learn quick and fast 

I have been burned more than a few times trying to help them , but then they aren’t apologetic or being a dick , then cancelation fee we go Why should I tip a POC or immigrant regardless of how the ride was? Fuck that noise Unionise! Y’all should unionize You should have just cancelled the ride and let them book another. They may have gotten picked up sooner too. Yea let’s do this. Come after me with whatever you got. spit vitriol, get it out fellow slaves.

I’m in this job a a post modern missionary. I was raised in Texas as a Baptist. I went to a Baptist college in Texas. That shit is deep in me.
I also lived in Kenya for a year so I know white privlege is a global phenomenon.

 I see rideshare as aid work.

 I just moved to Denver because I wanted to work for HopSkipDrive because they are Uber for kids and I’m sick of driving drunk assholes around. Most of the time I’m not driving drunk assholes around, it’s probably happened 20 times out of the 5000. But that shit still fucks with me. I’m a sensitive dude. I’ve must have spent at least $1200 in therapy dealing with the shit we have to see and experience.

But I don’t want to drive around just rich kids. I do want that, i was a rich kid, i know what it’s like.

I want to give rides to homeless dudes who need to get 30 miles in the direction I’m headed. I get that with Uber and Lyft. I might do this job til I die (and since I’ve been mugged twice on the job, that could be soon).

I also am single, no kids, 30s and have affluent parents so if this gig fails I can still go be teacher and make less than what we make in Denver/DFW/Waco so I’ve got that going for me that I’m sure a lot of drivers don’t.

So yea, I know how to hit the fucking cancel button. That’s why I thought putting 5000 rides would let you know I’m not a dumbshit. 

Also, 4.87 on Uber. Perfect 5 on Lyft (though I don’t believe it. I went from 4.74-5 in about 16 days. My lowest rating point was 4.61 with Lyft . As I’m sure you can tell, I’ve probably crossed some lines and pissed some people off.

And 0 vomits in the car. A few after I pulled over, but my condolences to all of you that have cleaned up body fluids.

What’s the point of Uber cash if they still authorize your debit card and then refund it? The whole point is to use it when you don’t have money on your debit card.,13,89.99018803563658,uber,,"That’s 100% NOT the point of it at all. You misunderstand what’s happening. 

Uber preauthorizes your credit/debit card because they need payment info on file in case you damage the drivers’ car (throw up after drinking. Start smoking. Etc). It’s like how rental car companies won’t take payment by debit card or cash unless you offer a security payment or other guarantee. 

Uber cash creates several benefits for Uber that explain why they can offer discounts for you to buy it:  

1.	Every time you ride, Uber has to pay an acquisition charge + a fixed rate for card-not-present visa/mc/Amex swipes. 4x $25 charges cost Uber at least $1 more in fees than 1x $100 charge. This is part of the reason the discount scales with higher amount purchased at once. 

2.	Uber competes for market share with lyft. Having “Uber cash” available in your account means they’re making it more likely you will ride with them, even if their rate quote is slightly higher. They’re locking you in as a customer. 

3.	Uber cash eliminates the risk of a chargeback from a credit card issuer. These cost $30+ for a merchant to resolve per incident. 

4.	Uber cash allows Uber to effectively borrow money for operations at 0% interest. It’s “float”. Banks make a lot of money on float. Uber uses it to reduce their borrowing cost. 

5.	Uber already offered prepaid gift cards in stores that did the same thing as “Uber cash reloads”. Uber had to pay a large commission (about $5-7 per $100) to grocery stores and drug stores to carry their cards and load them for customers. Uber pays much less to get the same lock in and float benefits by selling directly to customers than they do selling via Blackhawk or third party network. Do you think grocery stores devote floor space to these gift cards and give fuel points out on them for free? No. They profit on them b/c they get a commission. Because the gift card vendor is locking you in. 

6.	Many gift cards are never actually redeemed. The physical card is lost. The person loses access to their email and doesn’t pursue it. The person dies. All leading to forgotten gift card balances. Look up “unredeemed gift cards” on google. There’s over $100 billion out there in the world in free float from unredeemed gift cards. Pretty crazy. Thats not really the point of it.  It was mostly made (as far as im aware) so people could buy giftcard for others so they can get their friends hooked on getting ubers.  And with the advent of the rewards they can give you free uber cash.  (Also a place to refund to so you don’t get cash back but actually have to take more rides) I can use my Amazon Prime card and buy uber gift cards from Amazon, and get (effectively) 5% back, without having to plunk $100 at a time, to get that discount. Plus, after so many rides, Uber (Uber Rewards) will give you a $5 credit in Uber Cash. There's also the Visa rewards thing, where you can get Uber Credit for various purchases Yeh this is annoying. I bought a gift card because I didn’t have a lot of money left in my bank account. I ended up with several bank fees for insufficient funds because Uber was holding money on my bank Card then putting it back even though I was using the gift card. 
I also cant stand that the tip is a separate charge also. The fare and tip should be one charge. The point of Uber cash is to (1) expand market reach (2) borrow capital from customers. What exactly is UBER cash? LMAO. Yeah! What's the point. That's stupid!"

I make this mistake monthly because I rotate between using my wife’s car and my own , my car use more gas and I use her car when she gets off work .

They also said that the closing of the account is non-negotiable... After some fight back, my case was escalated and then, I got a response that they made an error and I was unblocked again (I cannot remember whether I tried using it again)

Then, two years passed without Uber (since they are not available for in my country). Now, I was in New York and tried using it. Everytime I try to get an Uber it says ""oops something went wrong""

Now the ridiculous part starts: Everytime I contact support in the app or Twitter DM, they respond and ask me to state my account name etc. and after I do this, they fall completely silent.

This is the most ridiculous thing I experienced with corporate support. They don't even say that they lock me out of service of some shady reason and I should not contact again - they just fall silent ...

Ever since the ipo came out ratings are going down across the board I went from 4.98 to 4.93 In about a month and every passenger and rider I talk to says there ratings are going down to. I just wish the rating system was less arbitrary. You dont know who dings you and the comments are about the vaguest things I have ever read. I feel for you man I really do Ask them questions about themselves, and try to get them talking about themselves. I usually start out with, ""how's your day going so far?"". If I'm driving in the morning, I ask if they're heading to the office, which usually turns into what kind of work they do. If I'm taking them to the airport, I ask where they're headed, then I chat with them about the destination (if I've been there). If the destination is their home city, I ask them for tourist advice for when I visit their city or country.

I also brake very slowly, coming to a gentle stop. I accelerate gently, too. I have a Prius, and I try to accelerate gently enough that the engine doesn't come on until I reach about 15 mph. Basically, I drive as though I have hot coffee on the dashboard, and don't want to spill it.

It also doesn't hurt to provide android and iphone chargers, and some small bottles of water in the seat pockets.

My driver rating is 4.96.

Good luck! This is exactly why I five star all of my drivers even if their car is kinda dirty or if they don't attempt to speak to me. As long as I get to where I need to go in one peace and at a reasonable time, we're good. I don't want some mild inconvenience or an unsatisfied preference I have to be the reason someone loses on opportunities.

Uber driver shows up in different car,27,91.16940099866855,uber,This morning in Laredo my Uber driver showed up in a different car. He said it was a rental and that I should get in. I refused and told him there was no insurance. Instead of cancelling he waited long enough to get a cancellation fee. So I called Uber and reported him they refunded me. Never get in the wrong car there is no insurance.,"I would never get into a car with a different plate number than what's on my app. The app literally tells you this everytime you ride now... I would literally just cancel without hesitation. I wouldn't take the chance. Not after watching the last season of Black Mirror. Anyone with gold or higher gets cancellation fees refunded if rebooked within 15 minutes anyway (limited number of use). Every ride is based on trust between the driver and the rider/s who are complete strangers to each other. [deleted] Good on you. Fuck these scrubs. I would absolutely never get into a car that didn't match my app info, that's asking for trouble. Good for you.  There's more than just no insurance.  Who knows what this guy is up to and you could be in danger.  Once more reports come in from this guy being (literally) and idiot and trying to cheap out like that and getting cancel fees, he'll get deactivated for safety and that'll be the end of that. As a passenger, this only happened once. Seeing as I was on a time crunch, I couldn’t afford to be righteous at the time. And yet here I am having to lock my doors so I can verify a passenger before they get in my car.  Strange people out there There WAS one time Uber didn't update my car from a Honda fit to a Ford fusion and passengers were confused. It was for only one day tho and I did only about 5 rides until I found it not worth it. As a former driver that had to move on after all the pay cuts I don't think I'm physically capable of caring less about what happens to entitled riders. This simply isn’t true. If that was your Uber driver, and you’re going through the app, you’re insured no matter what he/she’s driving.

The driver isn’t insured, but you are. I have 3 cars on my profile sometimes I forget to rotate to the right one. It happens no big deal How do you know there is no insurance? I changed license plates on my car and had an issue updating one of my cars. Had the wrong plates for three days. The car took a week. The pic is me and nobody had a problem with it.

Trip price doesn't match original quote. Is Uber screwing someone?,19,91.20193572090456,uber,"This has happened a few times, both when there were a ton of people trying to get rides. 

&#x200B;

In one instance, I kept requesting and switching between Uber and Lyft apps until inevitably, Uber, gives me a good (non-surge) rate. What was weird was how moving the pin one block reduced the price of the ride by $30!  Anyway, I get in and we sit in traffic for hours. The whole time, I'm wondering how the driver will make any money getting $22 (Pool price) to drive 35 miles in 2 hours.  I've been told that drivers are paid for distance and time and what they earn isn't related at all to what the rider pays (other than tip).

When the ride ends, it charges me close to $48. I click help, and click the option of the ride price not matching what was shown. It then asked me if there was unusually high traffic, etc. I selected the traffic option and they automatically revised the fare to the quoted amount.

The second time was a black car ride quoted at $72 from the airport. Traffic again, and I'm charged \~$98. Go through the same process and I get a refund.

&#x200B;

1. If Uber obviously knows what price they showed me and I didn't alter the route or add stops, why are they charging me more? I'm sure traffic and traffic patterns is built into their pricing.
2. When I get the original price after appealing, does that affect the driver's earrnings?

It makes me feel almost like it's a bait and switch because their algorithm resulted in a non-profitable ride. I know I'm probably wrong but can someone explain what's going on here?","> What was weird was how moving the pin one block reduced the price of the ride

May be the edge of a zone used for pricing. Is because their predictions are  not 100% accurate if you take a taxi you would not have a price quote"
DAE view a driver with “known for great conversation” as a red flag?,17,91.23263016536005,uber,,"No, not really.

I have that badge and I only really converse with like 10% of my riders past the obligatory ""Hello, how are you, is this your destination.""

I'm not good at coming up with random conversation without some sort of lead so I only really talk to people who actually start a conversation. I never have rated a passenger based on how conversational they are.

Even if its a driver who likes talking, most of them know how to tell if a rider wants to be quiet. why the fuck would it be a red flag in any way? like ""oh shit, this guy might actually want to talk with me, i dont want that? are you that socially akward that someone who isnt socially akward makes you uncomfortable? people prefer people who aren't socially akward as drivers. like you do understand that people give drivers bad reviews who dont even attempt to make small talk oh no--- I have 3 of those compliments. 

I also have it noted in my notes just above that section-- that I ""know how to read a room, please no politics/religion"" -- in other words, I understand not everyone wants to talk on their ride. I am fine with that and never give someone a bad rating on that. I will give you a lesser rating if you disrespect me or talk down to me. Basically you will hear three things from me at the start of any ride-- verify you are the correct rider/confirm destination, say good morning, and then ask-- all set? to make sure you are ready to start the ride. 


I tend to drive a couple of miles and look to see what you are doing in that time-- head down looking at emails or headphones in means leave you alone, no talking necessary.

Now I might ask you what airline you are flying for an airport trip with possible follow up questions as needed to make sure I take you to the best possible drop off point.

If you start talking to me-- as long as they aren't the dumbass Lyft/Uber questions all drivers dread (do you do this full time?) -- I will be happy to have a conversation with you. I will test the waters if you are staring out the window looking bored with a ""so how was your day?"" Short answer and we are done talking-- we get it. 


I don't understand how people who might take 50-100 or even 1000 ride share rides think that drivers who have given over 8000 rides don't understand this dance. Don't get me wrong-- I don't doubt you have to deal with some real whack jobs just like we do. The bottom line is most drivers just want to drive safely and finish our task. If you love blabbering with strangers, then no. Otherwise, bring some earbuds and pretend you can't hear him til he shuts up. YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP My default as a driver isn't to make small talk, really. I'll greet you as you get in, confirm the pickup name, and wish you a good evening on your way out, but I'm generally not really chatty. Don't get me wrong, I'll talk back when people ask questions and make some small talk, but I'm not really going out of my way to initiate it. I don't have the great conversation badge on Uber, but get compliments on Lyft for my conversation. I dunno... as a pax, I like the quiet drivers, so I tend to be a quiet driver myself.

Visa Local Offers...where to find places?,8,91.26479451721188,uber,"Is this still a thing?  I can't figure out how to search local offers.  The only option I get is the link to opt out of the program.

Any suggestions? Thanks!","I can see a list of places under the payment tab and then going to payment offers I cannot seem to find the offers either. I am using an Android version of the app. Not sure if the iOS version is different I'm having the same issue on Android.

I'm having the same problem on AndroidOS app.  I've asked them a few times, and I just get the worthless uber cs do loop.

What I have done that sort of works - only when you are in an area you will be using - is to go to settings

* Opt Out of VLO
* Opt Back In to VLO
* and then it pops up a screen to see the local available ones.

But what sucks about all that is that you can't see offers for different parts of town or other areas you may be visiting other than where you are right now.

I've got a (I think) low passenger rating after a trip to South America,15,91.98190099870165,uber,"My rating is currently 4.55 when it used to be 4.7ish
I'm guessing this is because on my trip to Argentina I kept getting incrediously asked ""oh you've got a credit card payment set up??"" When we had already arrived at our destination. This is pretty annoying because I'm pretty sure they know which accounts have card or cash payments set up PREVIOUS to taking the trip. Some would even ask me to pay cash regardless saying they didn't have their accounts set up with Uber and didn't actually get payed, but then why did they take the trip? Trying their luck I guess.



 Anyways what can I do to get my rating up though? Is it possible to set up a new account with my same payment info?","Highly prohibited for a driver to ask for extra payment from a rider. I just discovered this sub and thought something like this would come up. I use Uber almost every day in Argentina. To keep it simple: They don't get paid with credit rides

The issue is that Uber never wanted to comply with Buenos Aires gov regulation for transport, since they say they aren't a transport company but a middle man between two parts. Since they kept with the service, the local goverment got the justice to block all payments with local-issued cards, so after a few months of struggle, Uber decided to activate Cash payments like they had done in Brazil and Chile.

Thinks is, since most people can't pay with a card like in most of the world, Uber can't cash their service fare and drivers accumulate a debt (that goes to 30k USD in some cases). When they receive a card-payed trip (which Uber blocks them to know in advance, so they don't pass on it), Uber collects 100% of the fare as a debt payment.

Some drivers don't like this situation (Which isn't really their fault), so they have approached different techniques (which are their fault), to say: 

* Asking the rider whether they are paying with card, or more recently, asking them if they have change
* Parking nearby the pick-up point to find out if it is a cash ride or not (Uber tells them only when they are 100m or so from the point) and then cancelling if it's payed with card
* If they don't do the above or fail to do so, rate an 1 star

All of the above are being penalized by Uber in different ways, sometimes even with permanent ban from the app. But some drivers don't care, they prefer to risk it than to do a ride in which they might actually lose money (gas and tolls). Also, since Uber is not legal and has no control, some drivers use fake accounts created by photoshoping their documents, and if they get disabled, they just create a new one.

Some other drivers are glad to get card trips to reduce their debt with Uber. But in any case, I recommend using Cabify which is legal and the country and pays their drivers the card trips

This could all be easily solved if Uber complied with transport regulation and had a real presence in the country (they don't have offices) Is your rating causing you a problem? Man the purpose of Uber imo is convenience. Not having to carry cash being one of them. It's kind of weird that they do cash transactions in other countries. A 4.5 is pretty low. A driver gets deactivated once they remain in 4.6. 

Can't speak for European drivers as I don't know how they operate over there, if tipping is a Norm or not. However that's always best way to increase ratings. This question is asked and answered every day on here. Read through some older posts before asking."
Question about adding a stop,6,91.98228294315989,uber,"This is kind of last minute, but would appreciate it if a driver could answer my quick question:

&#x200B;

If I need to grab something really quickly from my friends office on my way home, is it appropriate to add a stop there and run up to get it? Ideally she would bring it down to the street but may be tied to her desk. Just want to know the etiquette around this. Thanks!

&#x200B;

Edit: typed ""guest"" instead of ""desk""","Yeah it is fine just dont take to long and inform the driver of the plan Ultimately it will be up to your individual driver to decide that. It doesn’t sound out of line to ask but does it take you 10 minutes to get in and out of the building? How long will the driver actually be sitting there waiting is what they need to know and they can make the decision based on that. As others mentioned, offering and paying a cash tip for such an additional service would be added incentive for the driver to say yes. be sure to add it in the app for starters. A lot of time it comes down to how you explain what you need to do. I know I get mad when it comes off sounding like someone is barking orders at me. 


Above all else-- do not leave an anchor in the car (any of your stuff). What if you get stuck in an elevator-- or someone starts talking to you-- or whatever. Some people think that it only takes 5 minutes to walk to the back of Walmart and then go through checkout-- which is impossible -- but they try to get you to sit there anyway then take their time going in and out-- which makes us feel like we are being disrespected. To make matters worse--- it is a short ride that takes half an hour and we get a whopping 4 dollars for doing. 


Not that this is your case but the example is there to show our viewpoint on some of this stuff. Like I said-- how you bring up the task is key. Thanks for the replies - didn't end up having to stop, but good to know nontheless! As long as the stop is less than 5 minutes.  I don’t mind quick stops at all, but sitting for more than 5 minutes is starting to lose money for a driver.  If you really want a driver to wait longer, an upfront cash tip for waiting will work wonders.  
I NEVER ask for or even mention tips unless a passenger asks a direct question, but for $20, I’ll sit around for an hour while you shop at Walmart.  For nothing, I’ll wait 5 minutes. Money talks, bullshit walks"
Question for riders.,17,91.98780377649324,uber,"What can I do to make your ride more enjoyable? I currently have a 2005 Saab 9-2x and I've gotten a lot of compliments on the car itself, and on my sound system (it's upgraded quite a bit) I have a WiFi hotspot open for anyone that needs it(it's happened a couple of times) and I have a charger for anyone that needs it, but my windows aren't tinted yet, and I haven't put any kind of mood lighting or the Uber sign yet (gotta make money to spend money. Haha) but what would you like to see/have to have a more enjoyable time?","No need for mood lighting.

Just make sure it is clean, odor free and you drive safely. Maybe you can offer complementary in-drive therapy sessions (drugs included) and two minute mini neck and shoulders massage at the end of the ride? And then tip them cash for the privilege of driving them and everyone will be happy ! 1: Listen to what the rider has to say with a genuine interest in understanding them. There is nothing better than being heard. If you don't understand them at some point and feel like you should or like they would expect you to, say, ""I'm so sorry, I didn't catch that part. I really want to understand you/understand what happened to you, could you repeat that part in a different way?"" I can't think of anything that puts me into a better mood that someone actually caring about what I have to say. Fake it and I see through it, nobody likes being placated or being lied to. 

2: Clean, no smells. 

3: Use a 3 second following distance. Defensive driving all the way. 

4: Do what I did, I had 100% 5 stars for months...I would leave my phone on the holder where the client could watch me give THEM 5 stars. They would repay in kind, and I drove a BMW 330xi that was clean and awesome!

5: Start part time at a local cab company. Sometimes there is room for advancement. Get ceramic tint. Makes your car a lot more comfortable. Keep the music at an ""elevator music"" level unless your rider asks you to turn it up. I don't have my uber driver change the station since I don't really care about what music is on during my 10-15 minute ride home, it just sucks when they're blasting the music so they can't even hear me ask a question, and I can't hear my headphones. For the most part, get me to my destination with as little fanfare as possible. 

As a taller man, I'm grateful when I can sit in the front seat (but I totally get why some drivers prefer I not use the passenger seat.)  

If the rider is giving curt or default answers to smalltalk, then allow the silence.   

The one thing that I have found useful has been when the driver knows the area. It makes the ""where are you?"" conversation much, much easier.  Learn how to describe where you are in terms of coordinates or landmarks. Ask if you’re passengers would prefer conversation or silence. I get one driver a year who does this and I find it incredibly thoughtful. Sometimes I’m exhausted and don’t want to go through what I do for a living or where I’m originally from etc... sometimes I do. It’s great when I’m actually asked for a preference. I would recommend the light up Uber sign, just for better visibility at night. Clean and no smells are the thing I really care about (almost Platinum status pax here fwiw) and safe driving like others have said. A option of hot foods to eat like hotdogs or popcorn. Depending on how many miles you have and how much maintenance you did, the ride might not be as comfortable as they want. You might not feel a rough ride, they might. Especially comparing to newer softer rides up to date cars they've ridden in has. You can try pushing the front passenger seat all the forward for the taller pax. But it's not going to get much comfortable from that. I've had pax complain about my car as well. No matter how good of a condition my car is in. To me, I think they've been is so many 2014+ model cars that they think anything older is junk.

Edited for errors. I'd enjoy it if you had a cooler of water bottles and would be happy to pay extra for one. I'm simple as a pax - clean car that smells good and a not-chatty driver. Everything else is just... fluff. Hot coffee and ice. Movie too. A rusty trombone. Buy a new car"
Can anyone explain what happened here? It was a $6 trip and Uber charged me $24.50. Screen sits in comments.,11,92.1624218320598,uber,Image,"The bank statement shows a payment for Uber Cash.  If you go into your Uber app you should be able to check if Uber cash has a balance on it.  If it does then the bank payment is for that and is unrelated to the trip you took here. 

Next, if indeed you have somehow ended up adding funds to your Uber cash, then you should check the balance against what has come out the account.  It will either match, which means payment for this trip has yet to be taken, or it will show a value of what was taken from the bank minus the trip.

Your future trips will come out of the Uber cash.  You've not lost the money per se, you've just put in into credit to use on later rides.

If this is what's happened, the question is how did you manage to add Uber cash without knowing? [my charge on my bank account](https://i.imgur.com/eapbacy.jpg)


[my Uber receipt](https://i.imgur.com/7qf37ZM.jpg) Is the first shot from your bank statement? If it is it shows you paid that amount from your bank to purchase uber cash. And that doesn't make sense. Or is it a shot from the app from uber in which case it looks like uber deducted that amount from your uber cash balance which is not the same as money directly from your bank, such as a debit card. Driver possibly didn’t end the ride after dropping you off. Or some type of glitch. Be very careful letting others ride on your account. Your rider score can be affected by their ride behavior. Also you are financially responsible for damages etc during the ride. So if your friend pukes, lights a smoke, takes drugs, smashes the door whatever you are liable. You can always google line item charge labels and you will usually get something. Large companies will post their own wiki entries to help people figure out if a charge is legit.

Just bought Airpods to avoid talking to rude patrons,9,92.37378757283643,uber,"Background: Been driving for Uber/Lyft for over 1 month in South Florida. Hate driving at night (entitled people with solo cups filled to the brim with alcohol, had one very intoxicated older lady punch the back of my seat & demanding me to call her ""my queen"" because i said ma'am by accident. Surprisingly, the passengers going to the strip club at night are the friendliest. I stop driving at night unless I need the money or know of an event going on.

&#x200B;

Prefer daytime best (train stations, shopping plazas). However, the worst patrons are OLD PEOPLE/BABY BOOMERS WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE TECHNOLOGY AT ALL they are the most demanding. Had the worst encounter from a couple from Ohio yesterday. Dropped pinpoint while they were driving back home but didn't put their house address down? Who does that? So I was 2 miles from their home and delayed the pick up experience by 5-7 minutes.

Once they finally enter my car it was a bald guy with anger issues and his wife with the stereotypical soccer mom Supercuts haircut. During the trip he berated me, my driving skills and why I drove in the first place for so little money while it was pouring rain and rush hour traffic on the highway. I immediately bought AirPods last night to avoid communicating with patrons like that. I immediately gave them 1 star. I never met such horrible people who purposely try to degrade you. The interesting part is that right after, I had the best car ride of the day because the passenger was  super friendly. We just talked about our horoscope signs but it was a breath of fresh air compared to someone belittling you.","I would immediately 1 star a driver driving around with airpods.  You need to be aware of your environment.   You can't do that if you are blocking external sound. You do realize that it is illegal to drive while not being able to hear.

I don’t know if I’d use those easy to see white buds. 

But here’s what you need to learn, if a pax does shit head things, the ride ends there. I’ve had a woman start to cuss me out on the freeway because... she’s drunk and doesn’t like that I won’t blow out my speakers. She then started kicking the back of my chair, at that, I pulled off the freeway, then immediately after I was on the feeder and I said get out of my car or I’m going to take you to the cops. 

She started to act like she was going to try to kick my seat again. And I said if you do that, I will take you right to the police station, and luckily we were about 1/8 of a mile away. 

She gave up real quickly at that point. 

Call Uber quickly afterwards. They don’t like asshole pax. Too bad they don’t like drivers even more. If they were that rude to you, you could've kicked them out?  It's your car, your property.  Don't tolerate crap like that.  Make sure to report them to Uber too and maybe they'll get deactivated."

Uber Driver Asking for $45,105,92.59541951729193,uber,"So I am currently taking an uber quite a long way (roughly 1.5 hours) and my driver just asked me if I would pay her half of my fare (fare is 90 bucks) extra in order to compensate her for missing a fare on the way back.

Is this a common thing? Would I be a dick to refuse?

Edit: Thanks for all the info. I ended up just paying her 30 bucks. I'm probably going to give her a bad review. Also because the shocks on her car made me feel like I was on a rollercoaster lol.","Driver here: If you are already halfway through the drive, NOT COOL. this sort of thing is , if at all, negotiated prior to the start of the trip, not once you have put the car in drive.

&#x200B;

I have never done it myself but that's because I have gotten real good at piecing together the necessary rides to get home on my own - even if it takes another 3-4 hours. The ballsiest I have ever gotten and even then only if the pax brings up the subject on well how we do financially, (pretty common) after explaining the gist, then it becomes an example of when you might think we're doing GREAT (long ride) but really it's a mixed bag. 

&#x200B;

I'll mention that **this** long ass ride to the boonies is exactly one of those double edged situations and I'll get into a little detail about how it's GREAT to get a nice 50 or 75 mile ride as we DO get paid by the mile after all, but then you end up out in the boondocks at 10pm and you have to try and put together a string of rides to get home and more often than not, you are riding home more or less empty - it's situations like THIS where you HOPE the passenger understands and appreciates what you are extending in order to provide them with PROPER SERVICE and recognizes that service in the form of a TIP. ( ""air quotes on 'proper service' brief eye contact via rearview mirror + wink wink and a grin ) and they USUALLY GET IT.

&#x200B;

You can navigate this conversation with some degree of dexterity, while you still may get stiffed, usually they will throw a decent tip.  10- 20 bucks which goes a long way (covers next tank of gas) and now I can relax and drop into destination mode and start working my way home.

&#x200B;

If it ISN'T handled with some degree of dexterity, then it can turn into a 'driver holding me financially hostage and inconveniencing me instead of just getting on with the ride' - you have to be reasonable, take the time and explain  - we take the good with the bad, but we REALLY APPRECIATE a nice tip at the end of a long ride when we end up far from home - for you. Ask if there are any stops you can make for them - again offer PROPER SERVICE. [deleted] I'm a driver. It sucks to come back empty. But it should not be your problem. You are paying for a trip from your pickup to your dropoff location. What I have to do after I drop you off should not be your concern. It would be nice to get a tip. But I would definitely not ask you for half of the fare. That driver is just being a dick. Definitely report them as it is against ToS to ask for money like this. If your ordered a taxi like your would be forced to 10 years ago the taxi would double charge you because you are leaving the local market. 

If you are taking a fare outside of the local market you should always give at least 25 percent tip to cover return costs. Totally not a common thing, your uber is (pardon the pun) “taking you for a ride.” I’d just politely decline if I were you, they’re not obligated to make such a long trip. She chose to accept your ride so she should be taking you back and forth without complaint.
If the driver is a doiche about it, I’d even report it to Uber. I see comments about out of driving area.  I thought we could drive anywhere in the same state as our sign up info? now when did she tell you this? When you were already driving or before?

If you were going 1.5 hours she should have asked you upfront for the money or to cancel if you didn't want to pay and it wasn't worth her time. Driver here, just tell them you will tip (not in the app). $15-25 should be good. Help offset the ride back. Sometimes you can get rides both ways. This is not uncommon and I see why other drivers do it but I do not but sometimes a two hour ride with no tip sucks. Half the amount is a bit much, but you should tip a driver well if you take them out of their market and they are nice enough to accept the ride.  In this case on a 90 dollar ride remember that he is only getting probably 50-60 of that.  So a tip of 15-20 bucks would be considerate because he will have to burn gas and miles on his own car to get back to town. So, I'm seeing a lot of these what the driver is doing is against ToS. That is completely false. Asking for a tip from a ride like this is completely within Uber guidelines. 

It's listed under 'Return to Boundary' they've done this specifically for situations like this. When a ride takes the driver out of their designated area to drive. Tipping is great and all but not everyone is going to tip. I'd rather see Uber pay drivers a living wage rather than say hope you get enough tips to survive. It's not super common but it's not unheard of and it's not against the rules. If you are in the middle of nowhere you should at least tip to make up for some the difference imo.

Edit: you  Are absolutely under no obligation and should not be pressured in the least. But there's nothing wrong with asking.
 Considering Uber has whittled down the driver pay to the bare margins, 90 minutes of dead miles and time back really hurts. Just something to think about. Ultimately it's not your responsibility but it's nice. maybe a tip, but it's really not your problem She should have negotiated the return costs before picking you up.

If you couldn't come to an agreement she could have always canceled the ride and let you find another driver.

To do it after she started to drive you was stupid on her part.

I always suggest to pax taking a trip longer than 45 minutes to call the driver first to confirm that they will accept the long trip.

Sometimes a driver won't see the long trip warning on their screen when the ride comes through.

This saves you from being late when the driver arrives and then cancels on you because they find out the trip length or that they will dead head head back. I don’t think you should ask. It is wrong for the driver to ask. 9 times outta 10 you will get a pretty good tip. the driver should have asked the op at the beginning of the trip.  that is the only thing the driver did wrong.  of course its fine to ask for compensation for coming back to the home market empty and to decline the ride if the rider doesnt want to pay. Is this common? Not really, as in most people do not use an Uber to go more than ~20-30 miles.

I'm betting at 1.5 hours, the ride will take the driver out of her driving territory. That means she won't be able to pick anyone up on her way back (which would be rare anyways because, as mentioned above, most passengers don't take 1.5 hour trips).

That means she has to drive double the miles for the same money because she is unable to earn anything on her way back.

As far as ""long trip"" notifications. The app only gives an estimated time. Forty-five+ minutes could be 15 miles in LA traffic, or 200 miles of rural countryside, so there is no way for the driver to know *exactly* how long it is. 

If the ride were not going to take the driver out of their territory, it would be a dick move on the driver's part.

Uber isn't paying us make-it-rain money. You may have trouble getting anyone to take your trip if you're not offering something for the driver's deadhead return. It's not against the rules and it's pretty reasonable.

I generally ask before we start the trip. If you say no, I tell you to say hi to the next driver for me. Just for her asking, you should have not tipped and gave one star.  
What an entitled jerk. They should be happy enough they are getting such a great fare. Regardless of that they have to drive back deadhead. We call people like you unicorns. On average my fares are 5-10minutes. I get excited when I get a 25 minute fare haha. Smart driver.  And smart of you to pay 30.  All is fair OP said the shocks were bad and still tipped $30. That's truly kind. As a rider couple my wife just wouldn't be able to sit through a long uncomfortable ride as described without feeling miserable all the way. On the other hand 95% of drivers we've had take very good care of their cars. As a driver I can attest to the fact that a long distance run sucks when there isn’t a passenger on the return. Having said that, I’d have called Uber then and there and reported her. There’s no reason you should have to pay for her empty miles. It’s part of the job. If Uber wanted you to pay for the return trip, trust me, they would charge you. I’m not gonna lie, I am impressed with the balls she’s got. Sorry you got a flake driver. We aren’t all asshats. 100% should not have paid her a cent. You got scammed. Report them, then tell them you don’t have any  cash and you’ll tip them in the app.  We drivers hear that all the time and its totally believable. Give her a bad review.  And report her.  Although technically legal (per agentkyya's post) it's still highly unethical.  What if you didn't have any cash on you?  Would she have cancelled and kicked you out in the middle of the freeway? No."
No benefit to accepting offer of shared ride?,3,92.67561627656222,uber,"I’m a daily Uber rider. i never use Uberpool, but often I’m offered a shared ride going directly to my destination.

I heard that you should never accept UberPool, you'll get shitty customers (since it's really cheap) and you'll barely make anything.


But that's only me after stalking this sub I am not sure if it's the same for every market or not. none-- they should do away with it imo. the solo rides are closer because uber drivers ignore pool requests.  It will circle out to ask the next closest driver until uber finds some schmuck dumb enough to pick up a pool rider.  So you have to go through 20 - 50 uber drivers before one of them says yes or accidentally accepts it because they were on pornhub.com on their phone and uber popped up in the middle of typing ""lesbian lovers kissing""."

I guess that can work if you're not investing in autonomous cars, handing out promo codes and discounts, and keeping your staff primarily in low cost-of-living areas.

Can i take an uber 400+ miles?,21,93.9451533136572,uber,"Am i able to take an uber 400+ miles? If so how much would it cost? Everytime i try to put it in the app to get a price no price comes up im guessing its because it is far. I would like to know what im paying before i accept.

Thank you everyone for the advice i have found the answer i was looking for and decided to just fly less of a hassle and will only take an hour. Thank you :)","It's cheaper to rent a car for that drive. Take the cab to the air port, Buy a personal jet, fly to Sweden, Develop your own fur trading industry, Hire Mia Khalifa for 3 nights and that should give you a good estimate for 400 miles in an uber. 400 miles is dependent on the area rates. My area that would cost around 800 dollars.

Try one for 100 miles and times by 4 For long distance like this , chauffeur service is more better for ya... most uber do not like togo our of the city or state , since they have to get back to their city and if they don’t get rematch ride , that’s a 400 missing /dead mileage You should text your driver as soon as one accepts to let him know your destination. Drivers dont know where they are going until they pick you up. There's a good chance a driver may refuse this trip once he sees the distance, not everybody is down to drive 800 miles round trip in one day. You could definitely grease the wheels with them by offering them $100 cash upfront though as a tip. Assuming it would take roughly 6 hours and If the fare rate is what it is for me (73 cents a mile and 25 cents a minute, plus 1.10 to start.) It would be  (400 x .73) + (360 x .25) + 1.10 = 383.10. Now that's just the drivers cut so it would probably be closer to 450 user side. It would be less expensive to rent a car or fly.

Some states allow taxi cabs to negotiate long fares, so you can go that route if you are unable to get another means of transportation. There is a website that will give you an estimate. Western Wisconsin to Chicago is around $350 but your market might be different. Call the driver after they accept and explain the ride. If they can't do it have them cancel and call the next one, saves time for both parties. We would need to know your area since pricing varries depending. But honestly no matter where you live that sounds a bit insane to do. Why not find a bus service that travels to where your going if air travel isn't possible. I dunno if a driver would accept a fare like this, sure it is big money, but they are probably driving back without a passenger. you should take it 100 miles at a time, don't do that to a driver.  You don't even have to tell them.  Just get dropped off at 100, let the driver back.  Drivers can only work 100 miles out of their home address, so if they drive 400 miles, they have to drive 400 miles back without getting paid for it.  Some might do it to be nice, but you are fucked up if you do that to a driver who is going out of their way to help you."
UberEats driver had their dog with them,45,94.0191926655201,uber,"Today I had food delivered by an UberEats and as they were driving away a dog in the backseat started barking at me. The driver also  pulled the food out of the backseat and my gut feeling on this is it's probably unsanitary and a risk for those with dog allergies.

Would I be an asshole if I reported this to Uber? My partner agreed that it's unsanitary but said I shouldn't report them to Uber for it. To me it seems like if I don't at least let Uber know about it the driver could be putting people at risk.","It's not against the rules. Scooby Uber dooooooo You're being way too sensitive about this. You would have never even known the dog was in there had it not barked. People probably deliver your food with dogs in their car all the time. And secondly, there's not much difference between the dog being in the car at the same time as your food and the dog being in the car right before your food. I'm sure the driver didn't allow the animal to search through the bag or anything like that What if the dog was a service animal and it was helping the driver I think you are being way to paranoid clearly the dog is a service animal that is trained to bark at assholes. This is exactly why I will not use 3rd party food delivery services. Many of the divers are not familiar with proper food handling requirements and have no training about it.


If you ever want to get really disgusted, take a micro biology class concurrently with a restaurant sanitation class. It took 3 months before I'd go out to eat again. You are paying shit pay for food delivery. Get over yourself.  

If you want snowflake food then pick it up yourself. Take out food are well covered. Does a dog in the backseat different from a person? They both breath and sweat. And dogs are dumber who can't open the bags and add secret sauces. Uber food is packed by restaurant.. driver never touch the food except the bags, it should be safe , 

dog saliva is safer than your unwashed hands when u go to the toilet That is disgusting but then again, even if it was against the rules, uber would have a tough time enforcing a rule about no pets or ""service animals"". I feel like this falls in that weird space of not being entirely professional, but not against the rules either. 

I have heard of other drivers bringing their pets along, but they’ve mentioned how docile their pet was, that it would just quietly lay in the backseat and that the food has always been completely separated from the pet. 

I have two dogs myself, but would NEVER consider bringing my boys with me for a few reasons:
-they get too excited when anyone gets near the car (they love new people)
-they would freak out if they saw another animal
-it would torture them to smell new food smells all day and not get a bit of it

In terms of dander and allergies, I’m not sure how much the limited contact would affect people. I keep all my deliveries in a thermal bag. Even though I don’t bring my dogs on deliveries, my dogs have been in my car. And even though I keep my car pretty clean, the outside of my bags have probably technically rubbed on a few surfaces that might have dander. 

In the end, it’s up to you whether to report it or not, but it seems like this is a rare occurrence. If it was me, I would just let it go. I don't do eats anymore.  But always had my dog with me.  Restaurant puts your  food in a container and bag,I put in insulated bag in trunk.  You will be fine. I think the best course of action in this scenario is for you to go shove your head up a dead bear's bum. You can probably think of something better to do with your time. Why don't you go for a nice stroll around the block? Report the driver. It’s gross. Especially because it’s good and most dogs can’t help but act on their natural impulses. Some people have dog allergies and they’d be affected if a dog is sniffing around someone’s food and getting saliva and fur on it. Even if it’s just the bag on the outside, it’s still unsanitary as fuck."
Thinking of becoming a driver,4,94.04361396181638,uber,"Considering becoming a driver to help with some side bills and I love driving. Current drivers, is it worth it? Some nights better than others?

Airport run , concert event and mass event are also great rides 

Just do it , as long as taxi still around , that means there’s still market for uber lyft

Get ready for people throw up and obnoxious drunk More drivers over in r/uberdrivers 

&#x200B;

But this kind of question has so many variables. Where you are, what car you have etc. Depends on car and what market you are in. I'm in San Diego CA and only have the XL option turned on. Helps maximize earnings but I only drive Friday-Sunday when I know the city is busy. I also use Lyft in between rides to see what pings. Uber has pretty insane surge charges at times so I made $158 in 2 hours on July 4th."
if i don't tip will my rating suffer?,7,94.15862553590149,uber,curious to know if drivers rate before or after the tip and my rating,"I will get downvoted to oblivion, but I only tip in the app. I don’t carry cash on me, much less a continually replenished selection of small bills.

I have several hundred rides and a 4.85 rating. I’m sure it would be a bit higher if I tipped. But certainly I’m at no risk of account deactivation. Yes you will receive an automatic 1 star!!! Never forget to tip!.

Ok ok, no tipping is not required, but definitely welcomed. You are rated immediately after your trip. I have had people tips 5 or 6 days after their ride. I rate pax based off the overall experience. of course it will.. as it should.. No. But if you care about drivers having a living wage, you need to tip. This is doubly true on short rides. If possible, tip in cash, even if only a couple bucks.

The things that will impact your rating: 

- Giving the driver instructions without saying please and thank you.
- Asking to plug in your phone to play music, and being an asshole if the driver declines.
- Touching the driver without permission. 
- Yelling at the driver.
- Making sexual advances to the driver. 
- Having a loud conversation on the phone, and not even acknowledging there's a human being in the car with you.
- Looking at your phone the entire ride, not acknowledging another human being in the car with you.
- Not exiting the vehicle upon arrival.
- Engaging in politics or religion, then getting butthurt when the driver disagrees with you. 
- Using uber pool. We drivers absolutely HATE pool. Uber cheats us badly, and you don't really save that much.
- Using pool, then getting upset that you aren't dropped off as quickly as you'd like. 
- Using pool and entering the wrong number of accompanying passengers.
- Using pool and being rude to other passengers.

The best way to get good ratings is to engage your driver in friendly, non-controversial conversation, and tip in cash as you exit the vehicle. Otherwise, the driver won't know that you tipped until they look at the itinerary.

Basically, don't be a dick. we can see the moment you tip us, we get a popup notification in the app. I always wait  a little bit before rating my pax to see if they tip or not. Sometimes I dont have time to wait so I just give 5 stars as long as the trip paid more than $10. But if it's a short fare like $3 and I dont see a tip pop up within 3-5 minutes then I rate 1 star. I hope so. Yes. No cash tip will get you one star if you ride with me."
I’d suggest avoiding Uberpool from now on.,15,94.21281535073011,uber,"Use Lyft line instead even if it costs a few dollars more. Uberpool may end up costing more even if it’s a few dollars less.

I used to like Uberpool especially in areas where I get a flat rate and there is usually not another passenger joined where I use it. 

But nowadays Uber has quietly lumped pool into their express pool practice in markets expresspool is not available to select ie north San Diego county. Drivers and riders won’t know it until noticing the pickup and drop off point is not exactly where they are standing or selected for drop off. This has caused a lot of confusion and missed rides. 

I remember requesting regular pool from Oceanside train station only to notice the driver was a block down the street from the station. Upon dropping off she was also confused as I selected Carlsbad station but Uber is telling her to drop off somewhere opposite the station parking lot.","Also don't take them because drivers hate the shit and we should really start giving a fuck about how much they make. I live in San Diego and turn down every Pool/Shared on Lyft and Uber. At the beginning I accepted them to meet my ride goal so my friend got my referral bonus and they were the worst pickiest passengers. Some would also get annoyed that another person was getting in. I only got maybe 6-7 all together. As a driver I honestly think any sort of express or pool is garbage most customers are usually the lowest scum of the Earth.

 Pool is usually cheaper than a bus fare so you know you're getting the dredges of society 

 As drivers we really don't make much on them and they are a giant risk.


For a few extra bucks you could have selected x no one cares about piece of shit pool riders, so just stop posting about it."
Can't cancel uber account on stolen phone,14,94.24864868406344,uber,"So my roommates phone was stolen and the thief is repeatedly ordering ubers to get around on it. There is no means of deleting the credit card from the app in browser. There is no customer support line. And the android find my device keeps saying it failed to delete the content of the phone. So uber has effectively locked him out of protecting himself against fraud. 

Is there anything he can do to stop them from just before ubers 24-48 hour customer service window?

Edit: Well, we solved the problem for now, we had to use googles call forwarding to put it to my number, send me the code, log in on my phone call to cancel an uber in progress, then delete his CC number from the app. All in all, uber was an absolute hurdle to get around. They need to have a direct means of support.

This is some bullshit right here.","Just log on to his account on your phone and change the password and information No it doesnt it requires a password. Log on to your account via a computer Call the bank and cancel the cc

Are you honest on star ratings or do you fake five star ratings?,9,94.3455121100004,uber,"Are you afraid of making your Uber upset or even give you a bad retaliation rating back?
Sometimes I would want to give an honest rating maybe 4 star but afraid that  might upset the person or he might give me a one star.","You can't retaliate so I give honest reviews.

 As a driver you have to give your review immediately upon completion you can no longer change that rating  like I used to be able to the past.

 As a passenger you have 30 days to rate the driver you do not know what the driver rated you until after you rate them as it doesn't show up on your profile until after 30 days if you don't rate them As a driver, as long as the passenger gets in, sit, get off at location, =5 stars.  It doesn't matter if they carry out conversations or not.

As a passanger, if they get me to my location without killing me =5 stars

I'm a simple person. I am a driver and have just under 50 trips and have about 25 ratings.

So some passengers never rate for some reason, and 2 of my ratings have been below 5 stars (a 3 and a 4). I have no idea why they gave me those ratings as they did not give feedback. 

If you want to rate low, please have a good reason, not something silly. If you still want to rate low, just wait a couple of hours to do it. The driver will have no idea which passenger did it and the driver has to rate you when the trip ends. We can go and adjust a rating later, but if the driver has had say 10 passengers, how will he know, especially if you wait some time to submit the rating? Rider. I've only given less than five stars once before.  It started raining and the driver said he couldn't see and dropped me off in the middle of nowhere.

He may have had my interest in mind dropping me off but fuck him. He can choke on his one star. I don't know whether its Uber's issue or driver issue this time however this time the driver stated that he is willing to deviate from Uber's pinpoint to pick me up but the part of the parking lot which is in front of a bank is too busy for him to search for me (as cars may honk and flip him off if he slowed to look for me) so he drove to the other side of the parking lot to where the main supermarket row is, though I was waiting in front of the bank and the driveway of that parking lot was not busy at all in fact there was hardly any passing car on the parking lot driveway where I was standing, of course, parking spaces nearest me were full however there was parking spaces for bank customers a few steps away that were had empty stalls. He keep telling me its impossible as he lived in that city for 22 years and know the problems of that shopping parking plaza. Uber pool is now a nightmare to deal with, these days uber is quietly applying the express pool principle to regular  Even where the express pool option is not available. So at times it’s a more an issue with Uber than the driver.

Sometimes I don’t know whether the driver is making me walk or Uberpool has placed the pin where it’s more convenient for Uber to pick up more passengers on a pool. In large busy parking lots and shopping plazas it would mean the driver may be dispatched to a far point of the parking lot. And might try to drive off if they cannot find me and I cannot find him."
Warning: Uber no longer issues refunds for scammed riders if they’ve received a refund in the past,24,94.4726648877782,uber,"I use uber several times a week, and I’ve been using uber since 2016. And over the course of at least a hundred rides, I’ve been refunded a handful of times. Once for when a driver forgot to mark me as dropped off, then he drove several cities away costing me $60 for a $4 ride. Once for when a driver ran a red light, cut off another driver, and made me get out mid traffic. Once when a driver was being super racist toward me. And none of these did I ask for a refund. I just reported the behavior and they apologized and refunded the trip. Well, except perhaps the $60 one I asked for a refund because I clearly didn’t request that trip. But otherwise, no, I never asked for a refund.

But last week, I needed to get to the doctor in the early morning. I had surgery recently so I couldn’t ride my bike per the usual. The driver accepted, and the driver was actually located at the apartment across the street from me. So, as a result, the app marked him as “arrived”. But... no, he wasn’t there. He had accepted the ride from inside his apartment. So I waited. And waited. He didn’t leave his room. Several minutes passed- I was stupid and should have cancelled immediately and used Lyft to avoid this driver, but after a few minutes when I tried, I was alerted I’d be charged $5 cancellation fee due to the driver already being there.

So I waited several more minutes til the driver finally got out of his apartment, into his car, and drove over. I asked him what took him so long. He told me he saw how close i was and decided to make himself breakfast, make some coffee, and then head out. All on my dime. I told him how uncool that was, and he just shrugged it off as saying he was helping me somehow get more time to be ready (i was outside...)

So after the ride, I reported him. I told uber what he did. I asked for a refund, because this bumped my trip up from $4 and somethin cents, to $6 and somethin cents. Not okay. I was then told that I wouldn’t be receiving a refund because I have gotten too many refunds in the past.

What?? I tweeted them, told them over messages what happened, they apologized and said I’d be receiving a message soon in the app. Nope. Nothing. Its marked as resolved with my message as the last one. They read my messages, gave no answers, and just hit resolved. 

So, be warned. If you’ve ever gotten a refund, no matter how legit, you’re now banned from receiving any in the future when they decide that. Even if you’re being scammed by the driver.

In this case, they could have refunded me the difference because it was clear what happened. But they refused and are now ignoring me. I’ve switched to Lyft, and if they continue to ignore me I’ll delete their app entirely. But this is absurd and I felt you all should probably know whats happening.","I drive for both Uber and Lyft. Passengers tell different form of lies to get a refund off late so I think they are trying to control that and you have been affected in some ways looking at your record. For example, a passenger reported me to Uber that I denied her service because she had a service animal just to get a refund when in fact she had nothing like that. 

Sorry for your experience This is somehow a funny story but sorry for your experience anyways. You are not the problem. There are scumbags trying to mess the entire community up with fake reports. You have been affected by that in a way. Lol, this is funny. I also change my playlist to pop when I see a white individual and to hip hop when I am picking up a black individual.  You should know that there are many good drivers out there trying to make life easy and comfortable for riders. All these fake reports needs to be dealt with before someone gets hurt. You right. I guess  a technical teammate at Uber did a lazy job by just checking your past reports and rejected the idea of a refund. Everything is messed up lately Can you screenshot the trip info? Its in your history and explains how its billed. Its not that I don’t believe you, but I do sense some exaggeration.

He took 4 minutes to get here when it said he was 1 minute away. I texted after 2 minutes of him not moving, and he finally showed up 2 minutes later, saying he guzzled his coffee and finished eating his waffle asap.

turns to

He took 20 minutes to get here when he was 1 minute away. He said he made breakfast and drank a cup of coffee... racism! It's weird that you can see it on the GPS and they dont even check it to confirm your story. It's not a matter of the situation, it's more of a lack of customer service and initiative."
Uber Passenger Lied About Service Denial,32,94.57553525815959,uber,"I have been driving for Uber for the past 7 months now so I know how passengers make up petty lies to get a free ride but this very lie was a serious one . I got ride request on July 4th,2019. 

1. I got to the passenger pick up location at 10.47pm Newark Penn Station, NJ . 

2. The passenger had a female friend she was riding with.

3. Both entered my car one after the other and the first rider said “hi “, the second entered and also said “hi” in a very funny way which we all found funny. 

4. There was no indication of a service animal wheresoever plus the rider never told me she was riding with a service animal. The Uber app also did not indicate that I was picking a passenger who had a service animal. I repeat, there was no service animal in my car during the ride 

5. On my way to drop off location, both passengers had no seat belts on.  One of the riders sat inappropriately and  had her feet on my rear air condition vents so I told her to sit appropriately  and watch her feet as she could damage the vents. 

6. After asking her to do the right thing, the rider did not listen to me. The mood in the car changed a bit because before telling her what to do, both riders were having a great conversation. 

7. This ride was a 2.65mile ride so I just focused on getting them safely to their drop off location even though she still had her feet on my rear air condition vent. 

8. I got to the exact drop off location and asked both if that was their exact address? None of them responded but got out and went straight into an apartment. 

9. I got a “service denial because of a federally protected trait “ message from Uber the next day and my account was put on hold about a minute later. I got a call from Uber “Special investigation team” to share additional information about the ride. I was told the rider also reported that I did not complete my ride and dropped her halfway.  The investigator told me she believed my side of the story and read some laws about service animals out to me to either accept or reject by saying yes or no. 

I love cats and dogs.  I now have a two year experience driving for lyft and I have picked a lot of passengers with service animals (especially Dogs) plus I am the type that loves riding with these animals in my car. 

*** After analyzing things, this was a passenger that paid over $20 for a 2.65mi ride because of the increase in demand on July 4th so I am not surprised about all that is happening. How can we safely drive for Uber if passengers can tell lies of this nature**","Concur with dash cam.  Anyone driving Uber/Lyft without one is.. well.. asking for problems.  It will protect you with not only Uber/Lyft (some uneducated fools will try to tell you that they won’t look at the video, but that is blatantly untrue), but also with court (both for claims against you, and if you choose to sue someone who does get you deactivated for a false complaint while Uber/Lyft investigates).

In fairness though, this was a pretty easy one for them to see through though.  They can track where you go, so you allegedly picked up them (and the alleged dog), allegedly took them half way, allegedly kicked them out then what... drove to the destination anyway?  With their phone even (as it can see that they got there).  Super easy to see through that lie.  You got lucky that it was easy to see through, get a dash cam. So I just received a message from Uber telling me my account has been reactivated. 

 “Thank you for your patience and professionalism. I wanted to let you know that we have concluded our investigation at this time, and we have reactivated your account.


Please remember that state and federal laws prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities, including those accompanied by service animals. Likewise, Uber's Service Animal Policy prohibits partners from denying service to riders because they are traveling with a service animal. Doing so may result in deactivation of your account. We want to be clear that there is no flexibility on this issue.

I have gathered some additional resources that you might find helpful when transporting riders traveling with a service animal.”

*** I Still can’t believe they trust everything the passengers says **** 

GETTING A DASHCAM Get a dashcam that videos both front and inside the car. Remind Uber to look at both your and the passenger's GPS data, because they both show that you started and ended the ride where the app indicates. You have to be an idiot to drive without a dashcam now. Passengers who see it will be much less likely to pull the BS."

"Riders, what’s your Uber rating?",54,95.21289636929554,uber,Mine’s 4.46... I’m just curious what other rider’s ratings are in order to gauge whether a 4.46 is okay or pretty bad.,"4 46 is awful. Anything under 4.8 in some markets is going to be passed over by a ton of drivers I’m an American living in Mexico and I take Uber all the time. I’ve noticed here that both drivers and customers will liberally deduct stars off ratings for the most inconsequential things. If I answer a phone call in English in an Uber, there goes one star. If I’m exhausted from work and not willing to engage with an overly chatty Uber driver, there goes a star. I hate it, but I guess this is a chatty culture with different norms. Many friends of mine here have Uber ratings in the 4.3-4.5 range and it’s considered normal here. 4.91

I don’t really care about ratings anymore tbh. I gave 5 stars and a tip just so drivers don’t give me 1 star. I’ve had my score drop just because I don’t tip immediately in cash, which I don’t always carry. This past month my rating dropped again for a totally bs reason. So I’m pretty much done rating anyone. I’ll just cash tip from now on. And I’ll keep it all unrated. 

My last ride, the driver charged me $144 cleaning fee and tried to scam me with a fake vomit picture. Fortunately, it was incredibly easy to prove the picture was faked. I got refunded after about a week. But in the mean time he gave me 1 star and my score dropped. (And I 5 starred and tipped him $4 on a short ride) 4.98 4.83 here. i wish there was a way to see how many trips i've taken. I just had my perfect 5 star rating (after 74 rides) broken by a lady who gave me 2 stars. The scheduled  25 minute ride took 45 minutes due to an accident. We had a friendly conversation the entire trip with her doing most of the talking. Plus I tipped her $5 in cash to help make up for the extra travel time. I usually only tip $2 in cash. I even rated her 5 stars. Yet she gave me only 2 stars. I know it was her because my rating dropped after that ride and I did the math and it would take a 2 star rating to drop me to 4.96. 

The only reason I can think of was she was annoyed that the accident added 20 minutes to the trip and maybe she didn't think my $5 tip was enough. 


Is it a big deal? No. Will it impact anything? No. But still it annoyed me. I knew eventually my perfect 5 star record would fall but I figured it would be from some jerk who hit on me and was rebuffed (I'm 23, female and Polish). I didn't think it would be from a nice chatty  lady who I thought was friendly.

Thank you for reading my rant. I feel better just writing this out. On the plus side now that my perfect rating is ruined I no longer really care as much about future ratings. Welp. Based on all your responses, looks like I’m in trouble :’) As a driver I would decline your ride. 4.97 5 4.91:) 4.95 I'm a 5 star man! 5 on Uber
4.95 on Careem :) Damn OP I would never pick you up lol. The hell do you do in peoples cars? Do you do only have a few trips? 4.6, but I do use the app mostly in Mexico picked up a 4.3x today.  After the ride, I made damn sure he is lower than when he started.  There was effeminately a reason for the rating. 5.00 papa 5.00 here. I have a 4.43 and I don't know why. I drive as well so I'm pretty decent with the etiquette. I mostly used my account in Puerto Rico on vacation though so I don't know if that's why somehow... Mine's 4.98, I guess someone rated me a 4 at some point. 4.88. I’m shocked it’s so high. 4.7 -.-- cause I haven't actually given any rides. 4.92

Keep in mind that the people who frequent an Uber subreddit are more likely to be better passengers so it’s possible that your sample here will be skewed. 4.98 :) 4.89 used it a few times in Hawaii with my family and my uncle likes to order them before everybody is ready... 4.99 with over 170 rides. I guess I’m not sure why 4.95 4.95. Hundreds of rides. Tip 5% of the time. I would decline your ride. So would most other drivers. My score is now 4.85. I have seen it decline and I tried to redress it by tipping, but of course drivers don't see tips until the end of the day nor do they know who they are from. 

&#x200B;

I definitely feel that this score is too low and that I have been deducted stars based on my age, race, gender, or how gregarious I happen to be. Uber drivers are also not paid well. I choose Uber (I almost always select the pool) over Lyft because it is usually more competitive and cost effective. But it's obviously a flaw to have such discretion over drivers or passengers. 

&#x200B;

I have used Uber maybe hundreds of times over the years. On public transportation you are with the masses and  it can be unpleasant but I prefer to give a nod to a bus driver or train conductor than to deal with a rating system and an uptight driver. 4.66. Never done anything other than greet the driver and then quietly sit there with my headphones in, either. I was 5.0 and then 4.99 for a long time.  Got back up to 5 for a week then down to 4.99.  ☹️ 4.90 How do I check my rating? I don’t accept anything under a 4.7 better start tipping cash 5.0

even before driving for uber i used to just get in my drivers’ cars and make fun of asshole passengers. i’d get in and with a vocal fry go “do you fart in your car, i’m like totally sure that’s against uber policy”

now that i’m a driver i just talk shit about riders. or about how shitty TLC agents are.

i also tip in cash and dap them up because solidarity.

I could be wrong but I think a PAX contacting you like this is a breach of the TOS and she \*should\* be banned from the service. Block her number and you should be fine. This was more of a vent than anything else. I did report her, however this lady was screaming like a banshee on the phone at me. I know shes not going to let this go. I heard horror stories about ubering and what disturbs me is that im aware this is one of the better ways for things to go down lol I simply told her to check her husband's pants before hanging up 😂 Just ignore it and report to uber so they got deactivated They can contact you for a certain time after through the app. I dropped someone off and they called 30 minutes later asking if they left their shades in my car.

Average of $20 hourly with super minimal effort ..

Most people complained are the ones that use newer car , either rental or haven’t been paid for .. It’s almost like shooting yourself in the foot Contractors can't unionize.  
But if they could then prices on Uber would either go up or all the driver's would just end up on strike.  

Either way, uber would be instantly replaced.  There is no way to successfully have a union for ride sharing unless the union could get a monopoly on all ride sharing.  That would be impossible."
"Driver said I didn't pay the full ride, I disputed and got a full refund, will that affect the driver?",2,95.42350979524355,uber,"I've been paying all of my rides in cash lately, and never have I ever not paid the full price. If anything, I've had drivers who don't charge me the cents the app demands, but it's on them. However, sometimes I do the opposite and give a full dollar, which is what happened a few days ago. However, after I was dropped off, I got a mail saying I didn't pay the full ride (it was almost a dollar difference, but still, I was confused as to why, since I paid the full ride). I disputed, and they refunded me the whole ride.

I had given the rider five stars, but now I'm worried he won't be getting any of the ride's money. I even sent an email saying I didn't want the full ride refunded, and that I didn't want the dispute to affect the driver in any negative way, but they just replied with ""We've managed the situation."" Still, I am worried. What happens to drivers in these cases? I believe it must've been a typo, since I have no other explanation for him to say I didn't give him the full ride for just the cents.",You pay cash to the driver?
"If a driver refuses a rider, why do they never cancel?",46,95.46415794340272,uber,"I’ve been an Uber rider since inception and I’ve never been refused a ride. My wife and I sometimes hop in Uber’s with our lap dog (10lb dog) that sits in our lap. We flew back home yesterday with our dog (no issues with airline) and for the first time in about 30 rides of doing this, we had an issue. The driver pulled up and immediately sees the dog and says, “Do you have papers for your dog?” We said, “No, she’s not a service animal.” He said, “Sorry, can’t take you.”

He closes the window and drives away but doesn’t cancel the ride. I was trying to pull up another driver request for 5 minutes and the driver refused to cancel the ride. I cancelled it, got hit with the $6 fee, disputed it and got refunded. I ordered another Uber and we were driven home without an issue.","I see and understand your point. If a driver declines to take you, he should be the one to cancel. 

However, I also see the drivers side. You shouldn't infer all drivers are the same. If you're going to bring your dog. You should immediately text your driver after you've been paired to let him know you have a dog. 

That way he/she wouldn't have wasted their time and gas going towards you I'd they don't want a non service dog in their car. At the same time saving you time and hassle. Many drivers refuse customers for various reasons.  Having a dog is not a legitimate reason to get a cancel fee.  Too much luggage no car seat for babies or too many passengers etc are. They want you to cancel so they get a 3 dollar fee for their time. Some drivers dont want non ADA animals for various reasons.

Just call or text driver and mention you have a dog when you first order. That way if they have issue they can cancel right then and there and save everyone time.

I love dogs but I appreciate when a passenger gives me the heads up. Oooo,  it's illegal and against the uber TOS to even ask for a dog's papers Why would you just assume a driver is ok with your pet? Pet owners often act entitled and this is an example of how. Your driver may be allergic, dislike dogs, or not want pet hair in his car. The assumption when ordering an Uber is that the passengers are people. If you have a dog, you should’ve messaged the driver to make sure he was comfortable with that. He didn’t cancel because he didn’t want to get dinged and so he collects the fee I suppose. I frankly don’t blame him. Uber is not for dogs. One time, a bug connected me with a driver that was in a completely different part of town. Obviously, after we figured this out, I asked him if he could cancel the ride so I wouldn't get charged, which he was nice enough to do. I guess it depends on the driver. Next time, text and ask if a dog is okay with the driver. Or lie and say it is a service dog. Either be a little more proactive and polite, or be unethical. Get out of this middle zone you're sitting in. That's where life's fuckery will always get you. I think they don't cancel because they can also be charged a fee for canceling. The driver is allowed to refuse service if you have a pet with you, which makes sense. What if the driver was allergic to dogs? It looks like Uber is starting a service called ""UberPets"" to help pax that want to bring their pets along. Until then you should accept that some drivers can and will refuse to let you ride with a dog.

&#x200B;

Edit: Apparently they don't get charged, but they are allowed to deny service to people with pets. This should only be the case if you did something that would make your request either against policy or against the law. Examples, you were lawfully required to have a child seat but didn't - driver would be entitled to compensation in the form of a cancel fee. If he's turning you down on his discretion you should not be charged, so driver should cancel.

All you can do about it though is wait out his 5-minute timer, watch that $5 charge hit you, and then write in to complain. This is actually one of the things that Uber support is pretty streamlined at dealing with. Because there is a ""cancellation rate"" for each driver. If the percentage was high his account deactivated for a temporary period, if he continued canceling trips the account will banned permanently."
Pretty good but Uber is so greedy. No reason they couldn’t have given me more.,20,95.53925053599531,uber,Image,"I can appreciate your position but IMVHO this is not egregious. That's (98 bucks) is about right for a  75/25 split.

Now when Uber comes through with the niiiice long ride back that gets you within 5 minutes of home in one shot ? THAT'S worth the 25% on a  good day. It doesn't always work out that way, but on a good day it does. I'm curious how much more they should have paid you beyond the mileage and time rates you agreed to when you signed up?  How does paying you what was agreed upon in the contract make them greedy?  How much more should you have been paid to make Uber not be greedy? You think you deserve more than that? Lol"
Is there any way to gauge/plan if there will be Uber available at a particular time on a particular day? Something that analyzes the popularity of Uber in an area?,6,96.00200516563598,uber,"So, basically I'm trying to bring a date somewhere that is about a half hour away. It's a 30 minute drive or so, including pickup time. Not terribly far. Estimated charge would be $35. I would say it's the furthest I would use uber. She is currently without a car and I'm currently not driving. 

I'm pretty confident there are uber vehicles around me at all times, and I'd be able to get a ride to the destination. However, I'm concerned about getting stranded out there and not finding an uber back home. 

Are there any websites or analytics that show how populated an area is with Uber/Lyft? I just want to make sure that on a Thursday night for example, I wouldn't be bringing her out somewhere and then not having a way back","Yea, monitor the time of day routinely for a while. 

This isnt rocket science. Go to uber app at the time and area you want to be pick up a week before or a day before , you can see if there’s uber car circling or waiting or nearby , click the x,xl, lux , or select so that will give you an estimate ..

If all else fail download lyft , or any local ride share , or local coop taxi , or even yellow cab Book an Uber. If it takes awhile, hang out with your date and talk. 

Don’t stress so much and worry about stuff like this. Unless you’re living in a remote village, there will be an Uber along in a few minutes to pick you up. You can use many apps to fake the GPS on your phone and see how many drivers are there at the time and day you want. Of course, you will think of ordering one and cancel immediately to see how long you have to wait.

It was legit even for drivers as long as they don't go online with a fake GPS. But I wiped out those apps now just in case. I don't see why they will check that for pax because you can only lose money."

I did see a few drivers reporting this bug. Hope they fix it soon! Are drivers who encounter this bug being compensated? It happened to me twice as a rider.

Driver’s car smells like beer,17,96.31638016569393,uber,"Hi, I need advice. I’m in an Uber and I can tell the dude isn’t drunk or drinking, but his car smells like beer. I’m sure it’s either from a hangover or another passenger, but it’s really bothersome. What should I do? I don’t want to one-star him since it’s about an alcohol smell... that’s a serious accusation. 

EDIT: I absolutely did NOT “report” him or one-star him. So abuse someone else with unnecessarily hostile comments, thanks.","It's likely a spill from a previous rider. Sometimes, inconsiderate people sneak open containers and end up spilling them. Just politely let the driver know that it smells like beer and be sure to mention that another rider would be able to smell it. That way, your driver won't feel like you're complaining. If I was a driver and my car smelled like beer, then I'd appreciate being informed. I'd notice it myself but I could easily have a stuffy nose and not notice. There's also this thing called [olfactory fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_fatigue) (also known as ""noseblindness""). It's possible your driver became accustomed to the smell. (Assuming you’re in the United States) he probably had some unruly partiers that spilled in his car after some barbecue or something. It sucks because you either have to end your shift and clean up or deal with pax who threaten to report you. If he wasn't driving like a drunk, then just let it go. Or 4 star him and cite that it was due to an unpleasant smell, but don't specify.

I've had a rider accuse me of driving high once because my previous passenger had been a pickup from a weed convention/festival. It's not fun. Whoa .... someone need a hug Fake post. you come on here to talk sh!t about a driver?

oh go f#ck off.

we hear complaints all day long from you whiny b!tch-ass passengers

oh no, you smelled a smell, did his driving seem impaired?  

no, of course not, so just STFU, and stop worrying.

you probably have enough money in your life , but youre thinking of reporting a driver based on a smell?

poor driver will be suspended for your bullsh!t claim.

seriously, f#ck off,  i HATE busy body entitled pax like you.

just take the bus if you don't like it, sh!the@d

besides, think of all the drivers that didnt say anything bout your smell (your smelly pussy, that is) so you can deal with the fact that there is a slight beer smell in his car from a previous assh0le passengers that spilled it."
How much can I expect to pay for an Uber from NYC to Baltimore?,4,96.33106766569394,uber,"I'll be flying from CDG to JFK and my flight lands at 21:55 (09:55 pm) on a Friday.

Sorry if this is too vague, but clearly I don't want to post a residential address on reddit.","Too much. Take the train. Chances of finding a driver willing to make the trip might be difficult due to the amount of time and distance between NYC and Baltimore.

The pricing of the trip will vary based on demand at that time at the pickup location. Unfortunately that can be fairly dynamic so it's difficult to give you an accurate answer. Good luck with your trip and I agree with the other poster - definitely check the trains. They can be pretty reliable and may be faster than traffic in my experience.

Using coupons and discount codes to shop online is certainly a way to consistently save money. The main problem is almost all coupon focused websites or platforms are not designed very well and the offers that are available can vary greatly in quality.

How to effectively complain to Uber that the fare charged was too high? The options in the app don't fit.,19,97.37225979538151,uber,"Asking for a friend. He got on an Uber from office to his home.

* The route was wrong or too long
* The pickup or drop-off location on my receipt is incorrect
* My driver made an unrequested stop
* I didn't take this trip
* We encountered extra traffic or road construction

None of these fit. Uber simply charged ~75% more than what was communicated. How to get this complaint through to them effectively so that this gets solved?

Update EDIT: Thanks everyone for the suggestions. My friend complained using the ""I paid extra cash to my driver"" option and when asked why, he wrote that Uber charged extra even though everything was the same. He got the reply the next day that Uber reviewed the fare and adjusted it back to $38, with the difference being refunded in Uber credits.","Uber rates are changed by the mins , and price are reflected by supply and demand ..

Best bet is to go to the hub and find out why the charges is more than original price , a lot of times rider press uber xl instead of uber x , or they order the ride when the surging price just go up by the minute 

As a driver , we regularly wait for surge to increase before we accepted ride , and we monitor the price fluctuation by every 10 seconds , it can go surging from $0 to $10 in a matter of 10 seconds It could be different factor ..

Check the route the driver take , 

how long is the ride  , 

any tollway , 

does the driver wait a long period of time when pick up ,

Does the driver ended the ride at the designated drop off point , if the driver didn’t , he/she can take the ride for longer than necessary before he ended it , very common practice 

Did the rider make a mess of the car ? Eating/ drinking  and leaving crumbs / spots of liquid etc Different cities different fare, sometimes they have surge in dollar amount and sometimes in surging 1x 2x 3x etc I’ll say go to hub and get it cleared up, usually Uber will refund rider just so they can keep in business Make sure the trip actually ended where he got out of the Uber. I took one to an airport today and the price was about 10 euro more expensive than the estimate, I looked at the trip details and it didn't end until some little side street over the other side of the freeway to the airport. I reported it with the drop off location incorrect option and within 2 minutes Uber had adjusted the price back to the original estimate Sad part is the driver probably made 18 bucks

A cab ride would have probably cost more.

New to Uber - Need to set up 2 elderly people for an Uber ride in the near future - need help as I can't figure out how to do a future ride.,15,97.40087090650367,uber,"I can't see a way to do a future ride.

How can I delete the old coupon and replace with new coupon? Is it possible? I try to enter new coupon but it says I already have a coupon. Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr so frustrating.  The app is not user friendly at all.","Maybe Uber isn't the best service for this one...  There could be good car service alternatives especially since you are doing this for elderly... No, its is not the cheapest. It is the standard ride where you dont have to walk to pickup or destination or have to pick up and drop off other passengers along the way.

No idea about the coupon.

Just set pickup and destination, have your riders be ready when you do so, and always order a bit early in case a driver cancels or gets lost or something. Some markets have a scheduler but its better just to order an uber on the spot. Uber will give you a an estimate time of arrival and drop off. Always assume it'll be the latest time shown, typically a car will come in about ten minutes. Have your passengers wait outside and be ready as soon as you finalize the trip. You will have the ability to call the driver at any time. Regarding the future ride, I would just call when you need it, the timing wont effect how quickly you get a ride. 

Please remember to pick UberX for your passengers, especially with them being elderely, or they will have a much less pleasant ride. Next to the ""where to"" field you should see a car with a clock. This lets you schedule a ride. A couple of things to note since you are ordering for others. If you will not be with them please keep in close contact with the riders as the driver approaches. Let them know the name of the driver, the make and color of the car, and the license plate. This will allow them to be ready when the car gets there and verify they are getting in the correct car. Drivers hate waiting and will typically cancel (charging you a $5 fee) 5 minutes after arriving at the pin. You may also want to let the driver know who they are picking up by using the app to call or text them. Thanks everyone. Looks like I can schedule a time and day with Lyft so will go that route. I can also leave a message for the driver that these are for 2 elderly people without smartphones and that I scheduled the ride for them. Thanks so much for all the responses and help! I really appreciate it."

They can try calling their phone and hope the driver picks up. If that does not work, they will need to go to their cell carrier and get a new SIM card which they can put into a temporary phone. They will then have access to their number which will allow them to access their email / Uber app for support."

New to Uber,2,97.89286164726923,uber,"Hi all,
As the title says I am new to Uber.
I got a promo code for $15 in the app.

I am planning on using Uber tomorrow and I am just wondering if I need to set up payment in case it requires a payment method but just deducts the money, or if the code will cover it (it will be a pretty short trip, under $15 worth)

Thanks!","Yup, you’ll need to set up payment before you do anything. Chances are, the app won’t even let you order if you don’t have it set up. But in addition to that, lemme give you a few tips:

1. Don’t tell the driver “I’ll tip you in the app.” We here that on 99.9% of the rides, and only 5% actually do tip. By saying that, that’s a quick way to get 1 starred. Tip or don’t, that’s up to you. Just don’t say it. 

2. Order the ride when you’re ready. Drivers are just about on every corner, (with rates so low, we gotta make money some how, big boy <wink>), so we will get there quick. You don’t have enough time to put your shoes on, grab your jacket, kiss the wife, kick the dog, etc. We get paid crap for waiting. The quicker you are getting in, the happier we are. You want a ride, and we want to give you one, so let’s all work together here!

3. If you are going somewhere that you have to arrive by a certain time, *DO NOT TAKE POOL!* Pony up the couple of bucks for a single ride. Personally, if someone tells me they’re in a hurry after booking a pool, I will purposely route the trip to go through the most populated areas with the hopes of picking up more riders. On the other hand, if you don’t care what time you get there, take pool. It’s definitely an experience that I encourage everyone, both riders *and* drivers, to take at least once. 

4. Seriously, don’t tell us that you’ll tip in the app."

Be a good parent take your kids to the doctor and any driver who’s a dick about it, you don’t want around your kids anyways. And as the kid of a healthcare professional (CNM midwife) she would be joyous to see you being responsible and caring for the safety of your kids.

Opinions on this situation.,13,98.23456303621607,uber,"Not posting to Am I the Asshole because I think this post would break rule 9 there.

Today I was sending my girlfriend home in an Uber at 10:30pm, in the UK it's pretty dark at this point.


Whenever a driver is pulling up I always look at the license plat to see if it's the Uber for me and to make sure the plates match the one given on the phone. I thought the plates were different so I said to my girlfriend oh it's not the Uber.


The driver arrived and parked in the middle of the street and said come here what's your name, this was weird because the Ubers I've had before have all parked next to me and I've asked them if it's an Uber for Oliver, I gave my name and he said yeah Uber for you, I looked at his Uber thing in the car and it matched so I said okay.


Then as he was going to pull away I took a picture of the license plate on the back of his car, to check if it matched again because I didn't have much time to look when he was pulling up, and if it didn't match and something happened I would have a picture of the other plates and his car, unlikely but just in case, and I didn't see any harm done.


As I was walking away he shouted at me to come over, he was asking why I was taking pictures of his car, and I said I thought the license plate didn't match, he asked me to come to the driver side window so we could speak without shouting across to each other. 
I told him I thought the license plates didn't match so I was taking a picture to check. He was telling me he will cancel the ride and Uber doesn't need to me dealing with people like me. 
I asked what the problem is and he said why am I taking a picture of his car, I said because I can and because the license plates on the app were different.

He asked why I need a picture, I said to check the license plates, he asked what his license plate was and I went and checked and opened the app and it did actually match, I went back and told him that I was wrong and it did match, and he said exactly so why take a picture. 
I told him that doesn't make sense because if he drove off I wouldn't have had time to check the license plate with the one on the app, and if it was different I wouldn't have a picture of the other plates, he told me that I'm smart and that there's no problem, I told him no problem and goodnight bro.


I don't think he had any malicious intent, I think he just found me taking a picture of his car weird, however when I thought the plates didn't match, I didn't particularly want to send a girl home late without just checking, and I saw no harm in taking a picture.

Was I wrong to take the picture and was it a weird driver? 

He did seem friendly apart from the unusual actings.","If you truly suspected it was a different plate, then your actions were totally reasonable.  Once the driver heard that, he should have just shrugged it off and moved on.  If you want to take pictures in a public place, that's your business, especially when you gave a reasonable explanation out of concern for your gf's safety.

He's the asshole for making an issue after you explained yourself.  As a driver, I might ask the question (probably wouldn't even notice or worry about it), but would have understood and likely taken the time to show that the app matched the plates on the car just to alleviate any concerns. The only time I've been slightly pissed at a customer for that is when they asked who the Uber was for I said ""Uber for Katie"" then she said is it going to "" 123 princess lane"" I said I'll check, I started the trip cursing at the possibility this wasn't my rider but I did it because she said yes she was Katie then I said ""yes, 123 princess lane your royal highness"" then she said ""okay, good"" and proceeded to walk behind my car to check the plate before getting in. Like bitch I said your name without you telling me I started the ride cause you asked a question I couldn't answer without doing so and you still gotta check the plates. (Also that pax took 4 mins to show up and texted if I could get any closer to the entrance of the bar I was at directly behind three other parked Uber/Lyft cars. ""No I can't but I'm literally right here next to the hot dog stand like I texted 2 mins ago, I know you can smell it from the entrance.""

But yeah just don't be her and checking the license plate just makes me laugh after you ask who the Uber is for and I magically guess your name like the kidnapping wizard I am. Driver asking passenger for their name is a habit you develop after a few thousand rides & you've had at least one person trick you into a free ride by pretending to be your passenger. Yes this happens & they're more sophisticated than you might think. Imagine what it's like having left a populated area and having to kick out some stranger who just blatantly stole from you. It's not a safe situation.

&#x200B;

So, as passenger, feel free to check the plates & look at driver's photo, or ask their name. All of that stuff is fair.

&#x200B;

He shouldn't have created a scene, though. But I'll be honest, when people used to take pictures of my car, inside or outside, it gets the paranoid woken up. It just feels like someone's about to send in some kind of report and I usually have no idea why. But it's a non-starter, as a driver you shut up and keep rolling. Driver was being ridiculously paranoid. He drives in the UK, you guys have CCTV cameras on every street corner. Plus his license plate is proudly printed on his vehicle for all the world to see, so what difference does it make if it's in a photograph or not? It's hardly private. I probably would have canceled on him just for the attitude, but regardless you did everything reasonably well."
"Uber punishes drivers for refusing to take unaccompanied minors. This practice is counter to their policy, and endangers children.",27,98.26165794363452,uber,"Uber's policy is that drivers may not carry unaccompanied minors. I think this is a good policy that protects children. However, Uber's practices punish drivers for following this policy.

The acceptance and cancellation rates impact a driver's ability to get bonuses and other perks. So, they have a financial impact.

I got a ride request today, and went to pick up the passenger. It was a girl, by herself, who looked like she was 12. I asked if she was over 18, and she told me she was 17. I told her I couldn't take her. The Uber app has a spot to enter the reason for the cancellation, and ""unaccompanied minor"" is on that list. However, when I cancelled the trip and selected that reason, it still counted against my cancellation rate.

The girl then requested another trip. If I didn't accept the trip, it would adversely affect my acceptance rate. So, I accepted the trip, hoping that she had found an adult to ride with her. But, nope. It was just her, and she was pretty mad. I showed her, in the app, where I am to cancel rides for having unaccompanied minors.

So, I got 2 cancellations against me for following Uber policy and good, common sense.  Not to mention the fact that I wasted my time and gas going out there, and didn't get paid for the ride.

Uber is endangering children by allowing them to order rides in the first place. When Uber has already been informed, through my cancellation, that the person ordering the ride is an unaccompanied minor, they absolutely should not allow that person to request another ride.

The policy is dishonest, unfair and endangers children while cheating drivers out of bonuses they have earned.  I called support to have these cancellations removed from my rating, and they told me they couldn't do it.  Of course they can.  It's already in the app to select ""unaccompanied minor"" as a reason for the cancellation.  Just take cancellations with that reason and throw them away.  Then, bar that child from ordering more rides.","Yes, this is one of the topics that is being submitted to the commissions in their review in February 2020.
It will also be brought up in a Tort Law discussion that will eventually lead to a arbitration request and subsequent law suit. 
The process has already begun. Yeah they do that shit on purpose so behind closed doors you pick up them kids so they can get that money 
But at least they have a unaccompanied minor option unlike Lyft In California, at least, it's also illegal for a ride share driver to take an unaccompanied minor.  (Due to licensing, it's okay for a regular taxi, though.) I started waiting for the timer to run out, then cancelling, choosing ""unaccompanied minor"". I get my cancellation fee, and it doesn't count against me."

Switching pickup point and destination,19,98.60965562883074,uber,"So I was trying to get an uber to work this morning (been using the app for 4+ years) and i put my destination and select my pickup point as normal when i get a call from my driver saying hes here. I look outside my home and don't see him so i ask what address he is at and he says ""insert work address here"" so i tell him thats my destination and not pickup and he got angry at me. I cancelled the ride and ordered a new one and i checked this guy on the map and he did the same thing going to the destination and not the pickup address. I cancel the ride and order another one (This guy is maybe a 1 minute drive down the street from me) so i call him to let him know ive been having an issue and he said ""dont worry i see your pickup and ill be there soon"" 10 minutes later the dude arrives at my work address (despite me telling him the real pickup address) so I had to cancel the ride and try and find an alternative way to work.

&#x200B;

Is this an issue anyone else has faced?","Yes! I was having this precise issue this morning. Like you, I know how to use the app and have been doing so for years. Three drivers were sent to my destination not my pick up point. I have found no way to report or correct this :/ I had to cancel the rides. I'll just be working from home today. Urrrgh. The driver cant see the destination address until they have arrived at the pickup, so either the app changed and you are doing something wrong, or there is a glitch in the app.

Why not just switch the addresses yourself when you order the next one? Ohh I'm a driver and the app was doing that yesterday, switching between the destination point and the pickup point... i thought it was just me As a driver, I had this happen to me twice this morning. You accept the ride request, and the app takes you to their destination- not the pickup address. Had a similar issue with a rider last night, can confirm. Had this happen to me twice this morning. I found it so strange, called Uber because both pax cancelled on me when I drove 5+ min each time. Uber support said it was an issue on their end. I got one of the cancellation fees back but not the other. As a driver, I've had this happen from time to time.  At first, I thought it was clueless passengers who didn't know how to use the app.  But after it happened multiple times, plus hearing stories like this, I believe that there is an occasional glitch with the system that mixes up the pickup and dropoff locations when they get sent to the driver. Had it happen twice to me this morning. . I'm a driver in Oklahoma City and had this same issue happened last night with a passenger. The pickup and drop-off locations were reversed in the app. When I got the call I was just a few blocks away from the passengers actual location and had to drive 12 minutes to the location where the app told me to pick him up. Once I got there the passenger told me that I was at the wrong address and then I had to drive another 12 minutes back to the actual pick up, get the passenger, and drive to the drop off location. I called Uber support after I drop the passenger off and they confirmed that this is a known glitch that is happening in the app. Trust me this glitch is just as much of a pain for the driver as it is for the passenger. I should have gotten a bonus for driving 24 minutes to pick up the passenger but due to this being a glitch issue I did not qualify to get the bonus. This happened to me yesterday and today. Last ruder got upset and gave an attitude but I tried to explain to her that we don’t see the drop off location until we confirm they are sitting on the car. Oh well! I called Uber and they told me they are working on the issue, You should have texted your pickup address to the drivers and see if they are willing to risk the fare. They will always be paid by miles and minutes if you don't dispute after."

Also once the vehicle is plated you will need hire and reward insurance not normal insurance, this will need to be in the name of the qualified driver not you as you aren't a qualified driver.

Uber pool,8,99.04280377698993,uber,"Hey i really dislike that it makes me pick up people on corners, it is simply not safe, why make me do things that is that dangerous?  Maybe its my area of operation but wow it is just straight stupid to pick people up at some of these places.","Your car your rules if you think it's dangerous don't stop Just don't accept pool requests.  After a few months, Uber will stop sending them to you altogether.  I drive in Los Angeles, haven't received a pool trip in 2 months. That's pool express, which is how Uber found a way to make UberPool even worse.

So glad that my market doesn't have Pool. My acceptance rate would be like 25%. You don't have to pick them up where they are. Keep going until you have a safe spot. I once had a pickup where the guy was leaning on a literal ""No Stopping Any Time"" sign. I didn't stop and he was so surprised that he had to walk to where I DID stop, but the ticket's not worth the ride! Invariably, the passenger will be at the wrong corner. Stop doing pool it's not worth it for what little extra you get.  I stopped doing it a few weeks ago and lifes a little less stressful and making the same money."
Ride to airport with carseats?,24,99.06496812885283,uber,"Is it possible to schedule a Uber in advance and arrange for two car seats?

We don't Uber often (I just checked and my last one was 2015). I do see the schedule ahead option, but nothing about car seats.

Any thoughts?","No, you have to bring your own. Take the car seats with you. Install them on the plane and put your kids in them. Then use them at your destination. Easy and safest for your children. Uber Drivers don’t get paid enough to install and remove car seats with any frequency. They have a limited amount of time to make money each day and installing and removing the seats would take too much time. They need all the space in their cars for the dozens or hundreds or in my case 16,000 other passengers. It would be interesting for Uber to have designated cars with car seats and for kids but I don’t think there’s enough volume for that. There are *some markets* that have car seats as an option, but I don’t think any of those markets are in America."

The media needs to stay out of rideshare,24,99.42914636962944,uber,"I hate what the media has done for Uber/Lyft pax in the last few months. If you don't remember, some chick got into a car that wasn't her Uber and he ended up murdering her or something.

So now the media wants passengers to walk out of their house open the back door and ask ""Who are you here for?""

I get this a lot in Philly. So because some moronic chick can't take two seconds to look at her phone to match the car we now have to add this annoying extra step. Where I forget and have to fumble with the app to find out what this dumb woman's name is...

Say Im a murderer. How would I know to stop precisely at your address at specifically 2:23pm and wait 3 mins till you come out? And on top of that, my license plate wouldn't match your app anyway. So you don't get in. 

After you have my car, my color of the car, my name and my License plate and my picture. From now on if you STILL ask me ""Who are you here for?"" Im going to say a random name from now on and watch you stand there confused just for fun. Collect my no-show fee and drive off. It'll be your punishment for lacking brain cells.

Common sense people. Use your brain.","Rider here.  I had a driver pull up recently, right car, right license plate, wrong DRIVER.  He was driving on his wife's account.  See ya.  I don't understand why drivers are so triggered by us having your car info and name--*you know where we LIVE*!!  And frequently, where we WORK. Passengers get like 7 layers of safety. We get one. Just one. ""Whats your name"" and now the media wants to take that away from us. 

So I don't care if you guys are offended or annoyed. Like above said. Safety is a two way street. It's called a 2 step verification the customer has more than enough to figure out who we are if they can't do that they don't belong in my car Dude people actually get murdered, what is wrong with taking safety precautions with strangers To be fair, it was already pretty standard to say the name of the passenger to verify its them before you start just in case long before the murdering OP, I am amazed this simple question from a passenger bothers you so much. It says a lot more about your general ire towards the passenger population at large, or your relationship with Uber.

Like a previous poster said, people actually do get murdered. Passengers with ""common sense"" have been checking license plates AND names of their own free will since well before these articles started circulating. Would you have lost your temper with one of them before having read these articles?

Lastly, your comment is plainly sexist. Why is this imaginary passenger ""some dumb chick""? As a ""chick"" who has been assaulted by a taxi driver before, I am appalled by your insensitivity to the very real dangers women face just by leaving the damn house. A man could just as easily ask this two step verification question. Would be be a ""dumb dick"" to you? That’s kinda sexist. Women have every right to doubt and double check what car they are getting into - everyone has. I understand you are annoyed because people can’t check the information they have in their phone with your plate; but neither can you, or don’t you receive the name of the passenger in the app? It looks like you are unhappy with everything, not only this little and insignificant step.

I wouldn’t comment, but your post made me really annoyed. I’ve been saying this forever. Pax get our name, photo, license plate number, car make and model, AND it’s retained in the app FOREVER for them to see. They need to change that.

Any cheap alternatives to uber,18,99.53379914740722,uber,"So I have to start using uber because I have no car at the moment. It cost almost $20 almost every ride, forward and back. Is their any cheap alternate to this or a way to make it cheaper consistently?

Thank you in advance.","no.  they will keep raising passenger rates.  don't worry though, drivers don't see that increase. Cheaper alternative is public transportation. Or leave earlier and take Uber Pool or Lyft Shared. (Compare the prices every time) Checkout carpool from waze.

[https://www.waze.com/carpool](https://www.waze.com/carpool) Lol, Uber IS the cheap alternative. The only thing cheaper is public transportation. Just rent one then. It's usually cheaper than $40 a day. A bus? No just kidding lol. 

Uber pool? Lyft line? 

There's a couple carpooling apps also depending on your area If you use Freebird to book Uber, you get cash back for rides, which makes it cheaper. How far is the distance 

At current rate uber is 1/3 or 1/2 of taxi fair Lyft Try pool rides
Bus 
Friend / coworker? For 40 bucks and 14 miles round trip , pretty sure many peeps will do it Used to take Uber until they suspended my account because my card was declined.  I live in LA. I can take train/subway and public bus.  It's a lot cheaper. Not sure where you live or how long the distance but an electric bike might be a great investment. $1k-$2k for a bike but $40/ day adds up fast. Yes. Cheaper alternatives include walking, biking, skateboarding, electric scooting, etc. Also, buying a car of your own, like an electric Fiat, $99/mo plus insurance. All these are cheaper options."

Message to Uber customers regarding tips,67,100.023914888159,uber,I’ve seen quite a few chats amongst riders here commenting on how the drivers wont ever know who tipped them. That is absolutely not true. Each time we get a tip we can click on a link that takes us to that trip and we know exactly which rider / trip the tip is from. I’m posting this because I don’t want some of you to be discouraged from tipping thinking we won’t even know it was you. We know who it was and we send blessings your way each time. 🙏🏼,"really wish it said who tipped however, just a first name for christ sakes Yes, it absoulutely shows the tip in the trip history. It's how I know that only 5% of riders tip, regardless of level of service. Uber was created to get away from tipping.  Just sayin.... Yeah, when I tip a driver $10 cash and he still one-stars me for God knows what reason other than he's an ass, and it totally tanks my rating from 4.90 to 4.78 and now good drivers won't give me a ride since I'm under 4.80, then he doesn't deserve the tip. He doesn't even deserve to be driving. That's plain malice towards customers. Sorry. Yeah but you can give us 4 stars for not tipping and then we do actually tip in the app. I feel bad when I can’t tip, but I’m broke most of the time.. it’s a complicated situation I’m in life, but sometimes I do tip them if they drive me home at odd hours or they are a good person. It’s situational Because of this sub I rarely use Uber anymore. It is nothing but a bunch of bitchy self entitled asshats that whine about everything. I have no faith or trust in anyone driving for Uber thanks to this sub. Good luck, you're going to need it. I meet amazing people every day doing this job. Truthfully. I've just started and it seems only females tip. I don't expect a tip so never disappointed if they don't. Some of these are students and poorer folks, who might be strapped for money. What if I don't want blessings? [deleted] If y’all want to tips , it’s best to tip a day after , that way uber can’t take the tip away Sometimes uber have surging , long pick up fee , long distance fee , etc 

And that amount is fluctuate according the time distance and if the customer tip or not tip

Ex:

2 miles for 2 mins with surge $2

Rider price $16



Without tip driver will get $2 for the miles , $2 for the time , base $2 surge , and adjusted surge $2 totaling of 8.. and Uber keep the rest .

With tip driver will get $2 for the miles , $2 for the time , base $2 surge and $2 tip totaling of $8 .. and Uber keep the rest .

Does that make sense ?"

Not to rain on your parade, that's a earnings guarantee that says if you do 15 rides you will make at least 125$

&#x200B;

Now you might be able to game the system if you go hang out at the local grocery store or wal mart where every ride is virtually guaranteed to be a 3-4 buck ride but when I go back and look at my results, and back out my longest rides -  my average ride is probably 7 bucks. 

&#x200B;

My feeling is you do 15 rides and you probably break 125 all by yourself - but if you don't and they have to kick in 10 bucks, it beats the cost of recruiting another hump and running a background check on them.

Yes, common sense would dictate that a driver should pull out of the middle of the road and into the free parking spot right next to them, but common sense is exceedingly uncommon. I’ve never had this. Instead, many of my drivers won’t show up at the pickup point. They can be a block away, on the opposite side of the street, diagonally across on a four way street Because they are morons. Safety is a second language to way too many rideshare drivers.

And make sure you scream in the second driver’s face if they try and say the ride they are giving you should cost money. If you are going from Point A to Point B for a quoted price of $7, that includes the trip back when you are finished doing whatever you were at Point B to do. If the driver says it costs money they are scamming you. Seriously? Minus the booking fee yes.

What the driver sees. Ubereats,2,101.59353294384424,uber,"Earlier today I posted a guide to how the Door Dash delivery process works. Several people asked about Uber Eats, so I did some deliveries this afternoon and will walk you through the driver experience with them as well.

When your driver receives an offer for a delivery with Uber Eats [we see a general map that only shows the approximate time to get to the restaurant.](https://imgur.com/a/i9QsWGD). We see no other details about the order, and we have limited time to accept or decline. 

Once accepted, [we see the name of the restaurant,](https://imgur.com/a/UPsVx5k), the mileage to the restaurant, and the approximate time to the restaurant. The time to restaurant is often wrong, due to Uber Eat’s terrible in-app navigation. [We are also shown details of the order.](https://imgur.com/a/vllrrIL) In my experience, it is more common in Uber Eats to receive a sealed bag upon pick-up, so order verification is more difficult. Uber Eats is good though about having realistic pick up times, and I rarely have to wait for an order to be completed. The restaurants have a tablet that shows them a picture of us, so they are able to match our face to your order to make sure the right person is picking it up.

After receiving the order, we have a chance to rate the restaurant with a thumbs up or thumbs down (the restaurant can rate us too), and then we slide a button to start the delivery. 

[This is the first time we are shown where the order is supposed to be delivered.](https://imgur.com/a/VXXwy8L). We have no way of knowing in advance where it will be going or how far we will have to drive. Please note that we also have yet to see any indication of how much the order will pay out, so our decision making abilities are limited. If you have ever been assigned a driver, had them pick up your food or get to the restaurant and then unassign, there is a good chance 1) the wait at the restaurant was too long, or 2) they saw how far the order had to go and unassigned it so someone else could take it.

This screen is also the first time we’re shown any delivery instructions. Things like a gate code, business name, or instructions to your apartment are extremely helpful here. However, if this is where you typed any special requests for the order preparation or add-ons, please know that in most cases it’s too late to have those accommodated. Those requests should always be included with the order itself so the restaurant can see it and include it with your order. 

I also want to mention again just how terrible Uber Eat’s in-app navigation is. [This is an example from earlier today](https://imgur.com/a/ZlSHNvt) when I was sitting in my car in front of the restaurant and Uber wanted me to drive up and down the street some more or something. If your Uber driver seems to be driving in nonsensical circles, they’re probably using Uber’s navigation. We can adjust the settings to use Waze, or we can manually type your address into apple or google maps as well, but that requires shifting between 2 apps while driving, which is not safe. 

Once we get to your house and deliver you your food, we have the option to rate the delivery with a thumbs up or thumbs down, and then we swipe a button to show it was completed. [This is when we get to see what we were paid for the delivery. ](https://imgur.com/a/tyfH32R) This amount does not include your tip.  After an hour or so, if we receive a tip, [we receive a notification](https://imgur.com/a/D4NP5AJ) and our total amount is updated. 

When it comes to pay breakdown, Uber is great about transparency. [Here is a before tip and after tip break down of how I was paid for this delivery.](https://imgur.com/a/EYfVXVF) as well as screen shots outlining [mileage pay and pay for time spent ](https://imgur.com/a/xJEesZy). Note that Uber does NOT pay for mileage driving TO the restaurant, just from the restaurant to the customer’s house. 

Uber Eats is not as popular in my area as Door Dash is, and I hate that I can’t see where I’m taking an order before I accept it. Uber Eats also does not work in “zones” like Door Dash or GrubHub, so you can drive for 50 miles in one direction if your deliveries work out that way. There is no guarantee that we will receive a tip (some of you will appreciate that fact) or a minimum amount for a delivery, so there’s a chance we won’t make enough to cover the gas/wear on our car for the deliveries since we can’t see the pay before we choose to accept. 

The system has pros and cons, but we DO get 100% of the tips on this platform. 

[Here’s my deliveries for today. ](https://imgur.com/a/7vR7um4) Two people tipped, two did not. 

Let me know if you have any questions about Uber Eats! I might try to do GrubHub tomorrow if you guys want.",where did all the comments go? I guess the driver sees nothing

"Uber Driver ARE considered ""Employees"" in CA",18,102.05570886979224,uber," 

I was hit from behind while on an active Uber drive in Los Angeles with a passenger. In addition to my crushed personal car, I also suffered extensive spinal injuries. The driver who hit me, BTW, was an unlicensed, uninsured 16-year-old girl who was joyriding her elderly grandfather's car. Obviously, I retained a PI attorney who filed a claim against James River and their $1M uninsured motorist policy, and had to beg and borrow to come up with the $1K deductible, even though the other driver was 100% at-fault. If I had an extra thousand bucks lying around, why would I being doing this crappy job in the first place?

But today, I also contacted an attorney friend who happens to be one of the most prominent Workers Comp attorneys in Los Angeles, thinking I had no case as Uber defines its drivers as ""independent contractors"" without Workers Comp benefits. He assured me, without any qualifiers, that, under current CA law, Uber drivers are classified as ""employees"" by the state Workers Comp Board, regardless of what Uber professes to the contrary.

He could not wait to set up a meeting with me Monday morning to do client intake and file a WC case against Uber's deep pockets, and I strongly encourage other Uber drivers injured on the job to consult with Workers Comp attorneys to see if they get similar responses. Your injuries do not even have to be the result of an accident, you could trip while exiting your car, or suffer back pain from too many hours driving--any medical issue you experience while on the job would qualify, whether or not you are on an active trip.

Why do you think Uber and Lyft have lobbied their drivers in California so hard to reach out to their representatives to repeal the Dynamex decision? It's certainly not for the drivers' benefit--it is because reclassifying drivers as employees exponentially increases their financial exposure. The rideshare companies can define us anyway they like, but the CA Workers Comp board apparently has a different definition, and they are the ones with the power to levy meaningful financial sanctions.

When you drive for Uber/Lyft, your are strongly (encouraged) to drive during specific times when boosts and bonuses apply, you are not given information about the destination of the trip you accept beforehand and, most importantly, your are penalized by both platforms when your acceptance percentage or cancellation rates fall below a certain level. That's called having a ""boss,"" not being ""independent.""","Let's set aside the idea of contractors vs. employees for a moment. The tide is already being bent towards employees by forces much more powerful than us. So, what does that mean practically speaking? New York gives us a clue.


[New Lyft rules have Uber steaming mad](https://outline.com/Sn55pw)

> Starting June 27, Lyft drivers will not be able to get onto the company's app if they are cruising where few people are demanding rides. Instead, they will have to wait until demand picks up, or drive to a busier neighborhood—Midtown, for example.

That is likely coming to California if [AB 5](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/30/18642535/california-ab5-misclassify-employees-contractors) passes. You may only be able to access the driver application from areas with high demand. Otherwise, the number of drivers allowed online will be highly restricted. 

Forbes' recent Waymo article is also very interesting given the context.

[Hand Gestures And Horses: Waymo’s Self-Driving Service Learns To Woo The Public](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2019/05/19/waymo-six-month-checkup-headway-on-hand-gestures-and-cops-on-slow-ride-to-self-driving-future/#666001e61124)

> There’s another piece of the Arizona program that’s closer to Waymo’s long-term plans of full autonomy. A few hundred people in its ongoing Early Rider program, an earlier test rollout, **are getting rides in Pacificas occasionally with no safety driver** (though the company won't say how often). Unlike Waymo One users, Early Riders have to sign nondisclosure agreements and aren’t allowed to discuss the program. 

Waymo has started to test self driving vans with no safety driver and they have been doing it for awhile now. What does that mean for Uber and Lyft if Google's Waymo decides to move into California after AB 5? It is hard to say. Just a small disagreement here. Yes, if you are in an accident or get injured in any way, shape, or form, definitely get a PI attorney. A lawyer will make sure you get taken care of, both physically and monetarily. It’s not a get rich quick thing, but at least you won’t have to pay out of pocket for medical, (in most cases). 

But.....

Workman’s Comp varies state to state. While you’re classified as an employee in California, this may not be the case in Florida, Colorado, or Delaware. But this is where a PI lawyer comes in. In many big firms, they do have a WC division who knows what you’re classified as, and can help you navigate the waters. 

TL;DR - If you’re hurt, talk to a lawyer. Obvious shill is obvious. Just shut up already. You make no sense at all. Suck it the fuck up. I’m sorry but fuck off blaming Uber. 

Your situation sucks but Uber isn’t some magical Corp that has money flowing out their ass"

I accidentally texted something to my uber eats driver and then they never delivered my food.,55,102.09559312906254,uber,"I accidentally texted my driver ""wow ur a girl. boioioioing"" when she was driving my sushi towards me. I saw on the app she made a turn and then she started driving all over the city and I still haven't gotten my food. It won't let me cancel? Does anyone know how I cancel and get a refund?","How do you accidentally text an Uber driver? YTA.  


Oh, sorry, wrong sub.  You are the asshole.  You scared her off with your seeming misogyny.  What f'ing difference does it make that it's a girl?  Were you expecting something more than food?  (Because that's how she perceived it.) Lmfao. You can definitely cancel it’s on the app somewhere Lol She probably reported you and they chose not to refund you. Luckily she didn't press charges.

EDIT: this is sexual harassment and is a misdemeanor... I wouldn't be surprised if OP ends up getting banned from uber eats. > I accidentally texted my driver ""wow ur a girl. boioioioing""


How is this an 'accident'? I smell a incel here! You got what you deserved. Karma Delete your account and hope they don’t come after you."
Sketchy pending charges,1,102.33979451795143,uber,"I am puzzled by two $1 pending Uber charges or my Amex credit card - even though I replaced Amex with another card a few months ago (so Amex is no longer showing in payment methods), **got a replacement Amex card with a new number after that**, and also haven't used Uber recently.

Is Uber trying to sneakily find if I still have an Amex card? Or is that an indication of stolen credit card info? I can't seem to find any way to contact a representative via the app or website to find out what's going on before deciding on replacing the credit card again. Any suggestions?",Had you ridden any jump bikes? It cost $1
"Riders, please do not sing with your earbuds on!",1,102.59191257351803,uber,"You have no idea how terrible your singing is! I know. My homies always have to beg me to stop whenever I do that.

My bad. I forgot to turn the dashcam back on after I saved the video of a creepy guy at the airport who walks a long way straight to my windshield to take a video of my license plate after I stopped because the riders rushed to my doors. So my deterrent, a dashcam with an always-on screen, wasn't functional.

How bad can it be? The worst I can do is LOL. But it just happened that maybe I look gay enough so he didn't worry about me as if I didn't exist, and started to sing his favorite songs, ""I'm born this way"", ""I am gay"".

Once I had a happy face on while enjoying my pax's singing. But even at 4 O'clock behind me, she thought I was laughing at her.

I didn't want him to think that I have a problem with him; I don't. Maybe he would hit me with his handbag. So whenever I needed to LOL I pretended that I wanted to change lane and look at the left side mirror to hide my face from him totally. I had to do that whenever he failed to hit a note, and that's about every note.",What?
Cameras,9,103.12193572167722,uber,Should drivers have cameras? Watching some YouTube videos makes me think I should have some sort of camera to protect my ass.,"Yea you should Be sure to know your laws in your state or country regarding cameras. Some places don't allow it, some places allow it but only if you tell the passenger, some places allow hidden or not having to tell the passenger. 

Most passengers will hate you for this regardless of their intentions, prepare for downvotes. Absolutely drivers should have a camera.  If a passenger says that you harassed or assaulted them, there's nothing like video footage to establish what happened from the time they got into your car to the time they left. It’s for both of y’all own safety and Incase of accidents Definitely. I just bought this one a couple days ago: 

https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07MX47TF9/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_5A3fDbKXE7A3B A dash camera cannot help you to avoid attack from pax, but it works as a silent witness! Wouldnt the very fact that footage exists prove the cameras didnt help at all?"
